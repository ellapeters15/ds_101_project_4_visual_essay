A legal and acceptable protest on Grounds in Trump’s eyes

No one ever talks about the fact that the Nazis were pouring kerosene on the protesters who were surrounding the Jefferson statue.

Never forget these motherfuckers came to Charlottesville and killed Heather Heyer. And that motherfucker Trump refused to condemn them.

An army of the most mediocre people you ever saw.

Is this a micopenis march?

I’m class of ‘85. When I turned on the news that day I felt sick.

UVA will not stand up for what's right. The current UVA president has no balls or backbone.

Where do you think these guys came from as most cville and surrounding areas are very liberal. or most certainty albemarle county is.

His people.

Remember when we use to be shocked and disgusted by this? Conservatives are bringing it back.

Trump is pro Nazi and anti DEI... what does that tell you.

"Very fine people."

Lot of non UVA brigading on this thread

What is this

What exactly am I looking at here?

“Water balloons” with something besides water would be appropriate.

Did anyone ever get all these guys names and faces to see where they are now

Not terrifying at all! (PFFFFFFT) INCREDIBLY

hey, look who didn't watch his entire fucking speech about it.

Here we go again🙄🙄🙄

UVA has nazi students?

😂 looks a lot more peaceful than the “mostly peaceful” protests a few years back

![gif](giphy|jp33XyltDsEXcOiiwO) A legal and acceptable protest in a liberals eyes

The one in my town was way better I guess?? Lots of destroyed property. Everybody happened to be in front of a classic car warehouse with big windows and cars on display. They peacefully broke the windows out, destroyed every car in the building. And now that's just another shitty boarded up building in the city. But nobody had torches, or walked in a line. So that's good..

Yes. Legal is redundant because the human right of liberty enshrines your free thought and voice.

Fucking despicable.

Now show the blm riots. Oh, I mean protests, lol

Didn't block traffic, didn't occupy buildings or limit student access, no vandalism so, yeah, legal protest.

If you haven’t noticed he only makes excuses for his supporters that cuck to Israel

Just so I'm clear now, if you don't support vadelizing of anything musk, protesting trump or musk, you're now a Nazi? Just trying to get my right winged terms down for the next 4 years since they changed from 2016.

I'm just wondering what pretense he will use to suspend the US Constitution and install himself as a dictator for life.

Yall forget yalls founder Thomas Jefferson owned slaves

Confederate sympathizers = Nazis

Cry about it lol

“Freedom of speech and protest! Unless I don’t like what they’re saying!” - modern liberals

Absolutely false. Propaganda at its finest

Trump is against anti-Israel protests, are you sure this one wouldn’t fall under that category lol

Glad you guys are making a super big difference in the world

White powder!

It’s a public school protesting is always legal it’s the first amendment

what is illegal in this photo

Some people still believe BLM weren't domestic terrorists.

Leave the protest alone work on your football team

Oh wow an anti Trump post - so edgy, so brave - so boring.

Orange man bad - grow up

Quick question: Are you angry about the 'Jews will not replace us' chants, UVA's MRC refusing to include Jewish students on the board after this hateful event targeted Jews (and then proceeding to erase them as victims entirely of a literal neo-Nazi rally while painting themselves as the sole victims)? And will you ensure that this protest won’t include rhetoric like 'globalize the intifada' or promote violence against Jews? Or are you just trying to incite people to do your dirty work for you?

Man, look at all those speed bumps. Get a nice lifted truck, Those thuds would be so nice

Why not? It just looks like people walking or standing around. I don’t see fighting or destruction. Why shouldn’t this be legal or acceptable?

We should have a school-wide protest (WITH MASKS!). We cannot allow this man to scare us into submission or to eliminate the First Amendment. If you don't use it, you lose it.

I love he thinks the Feds can just expel students 😂🤡

There is a board of visitors meeting happening this week...

What's an "illegal" protest? Isn't free speech and right to assemble constitutionally protected?

It does my heart well to see and hear you young folks getting riled up over this (as any sane caring person should).

All of y'all really do need to read Dr. King's letter from Birmingham Jail.

Don't forget: it was the crackdown by social reactionaries against the Pro-Palestine, Anti-Genocide protests over the past year and a half that put us in this position. This isn't a crisis birthed in November 2024. This is a state of affairs that devolved every time a scared Jim Ryan-type called in riot cops to brutalize their own students for daring to oppose modern Nazism. So keep in mind that this battle over free speech rights is fundamentally tied to the issue of Palestinian activism and its treatment by the state and its institutions. To resolve this issue of free speech, at least, in any favorable manner, the root stresses have to be addressed. Right now, in this moment, that means Palestine and the reaction to its supporters by the state. The world's bifurcation grows clearer under pressure. Know what these sides mean, stand for, believe, and hope to achieve. Pick one, and do something for it.

I know!!! This is sickness. I can’t believe being under an oppressive regime in 2025. I hope we can nip this in the bud before history repeats itself

Next they'll take your diploma away if you've already graduated. He is a fucking clown with a crown.

First Amendment.

A 32 count convicted felon wants to cut off funding because people are protesting. That's their 1st Amendment right. That's all Trump do is try to bully and scare people. Until we stand up to this treasonous traitor, he's going to keep doing it. Stand up for our country and get him out.

Yall have a problem with illegal protest? Did you know wearing a mask and vandalizing a place is illegal protest? Busting windows, stealing, trespassing; hitting, throwing, fighting, etc.. are all forms of ILLEGAL PROTEST. Get out ya feelings and think!

There’s a key word, “illegal”. Get your permit don’t be a menace, block traffic, or break things. Seems kinda straight forward especially after the last “protests” where all that damage was done to the cities and things were stolen.

Absolutely! Protest en masse and see if your administration has the guts to back you up.They didn't cover themselves with glory last time, but they can't expell you all. They need your money.

So much for Freedom of Speech!

Foreign students should be cautious and not engaged in this kind of activity. their parents pay a lot of money for their kids to be educated in the U.S.

Yall support corps so bad

Good thing protests aren't illegal!

Let’s Go Wahoos!

Look at how Taiwan has been engaging in protest all these years and have their tactics memorized. Discipline above all else and good planning.

Please do so you can keep your mouth-breathing to yourselves.

Don’t do illegal things 🙄

There are still people who think he isn’t a fascist

Y'all should definitely go make a stink and get beat up, solid plan. Show them who's boss!

His posts on his platform aren't law. His word isn't law. He isn't a king. He isn't a dictator. We don't have to listen to him. Mask up. His Nazi supporters do. His ICE thugs do. Jan 6 people did. Marjorie Traitor Greene did. We can all wear what we want. So, don't tell people you don't like to not do it, Donald. He doesn't get to dictate that to any of us.

https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/additional-measures-to-combat-anti-semitism/ This appears to be the official version of that post, calling out hate crimes against jewish students.

Apparently our first amendment rights are the new Spanish.

The real question is why are we defending antisemitic extremism on account of Israeli politics some individuals don't agree with and hiding behind free speech laws?[which didn't protect slander even 300 years ago] I wasn't aware we hate an entire group of people due to their government. I don't support any protest that shames another demographic , legal or illegal.

"Illegal" protest means violent protest, he didn't make protesting illegal.

You first...

I thought the left supported censorship

Eliminate the first amendment? 🤡🤡🤡

Y'all dumb AF no wonder y'all in college

If it’s a legal protest, why would you need a mask?

When alleged “white surpemacists” wear masks, you call them nazis. When liberals do it because they’re scared of Covid-19, it’s “doing your civic duty.” 🙄🙄

At least in Florida the Governor appoints every college board member. College board members are those who decide who is/is not hired for positions. There are a few colleges in Florida where the Governor pretty much said, "I want this person as your college president. IDGAF what you want or think is best for your college. If you don't approve of this person, I'll find a replacement board member who will." One college was "forced" to take a guy who only has a Bachelor's degree, no experience with education, & had been arrested for impersonating a cop. No surprise the VP is a buddy. Having political alignment ensures higher government officials can follow through with these threats.

Didn’t our ancestors already stand up to tyranny by throwing some tea in a harbor and having a little kerfuffle called the Revolution? Why have we made it back here?

Meanwhile this puddle of shit pardoned actual traitors and is now trying to censor free speech.

Ignore. It will be the lawsuit of the century if he tries with this BS. Call me naive but the Supreme Court would not go along with this. First amendment in play

There is no such thing as an illegal protest. The right to protest and gather is protected by our first amendment rights.

Yeah, wear your mask and protest. That will solve the problem.

Love sent from JMU! I feel like the VA student bodies should organize some sort of protest against this administration and their dictatorial policies.

Yeah do it!

Do the masked protests at a school you don't go to. Less ways to identify you. Won't lose funding for the school you pay for. Can't expel you from a school you don't go to, maybe some way a lawyer can protect you if you get caught/arrested. Tho it may not matter because Trump can just say it doesn't matter... Ugh.

Another govt funded "liberal" arts school 🤣

Protesting is not illegal, nice try Putin.

Are you guys going to be yelling death to jews and/or barring entry to campus spaces to people of certain ethnic backgrounds? If not, then your good. If so, then I hope those on student visas are rapidly deported and those that are U.S. citizens are expelled for fear of losing federal funding. Protesting is one thing, being blatantly racist is another and that is exactly what was happening on multiple campuses across the United States and why people like myself pulled charitable donations from where I went to school.

Illegal protests Trump said. Suppose you’re intending an illegal protest. That’s a great use of PHDs and all the other amazing qualifications you gamers have. My bet is you won’t outsmart Trump or out tough guy the federal govt.

naw thats so extra for what😂 my lifes normal here

All he's saying is that he doesn't want masks to be mandatory anymore. That's all

It’s none of their business what your face looks like. Let it go to court if you have to; this one isn’t a hill SCOTUS is ready to die on.

President Ryan at today's demonstration 🧡💙 Kirsten Luce for The New York Times: https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/27/us/politics/uva-president-resigns-jim-ryan-trump.html

He looks like he’s headed to crucifixion

So the story is Ryan sacrificed himself to spare the University retaliation in terms of grants cuts?

I'm so damn sick of Donald Trump threatening people and ordering them to resign OR ELSE, simply because, what? The institution that they lead employs practices intended to ensure that people other than white men have opportunities?! Every maga who brought this shitshow down on our country can go fuck themselves, as far as I'm concerned.

Hokie here - sending all the love and positivity I have your way. Stay strong. Fight the good fight. #hokiesforhoos

They had one last “Run with Jim” this morning, his weekly run with anyone associated with UVA and mostly students. He is a good man and I will miss his leadership and overall love for UVA.

I am a virginia tech grad and during hard times the Virginia Tech and UVA communities put our rivalry aside and stand with each other. Anybody not going on strike to protest this is not a patriot. Frankly. Find a new job. The university board should have declined his resignation, researchers, grad students, professors, and administration staff should walk out. Being an american seems meaningless. Fuck the "Carlyle Group" board.

As a hokie. I stand with UVA

How are we feeling about constructive engagement now, Miller Center? https://millercenter.org/how-disagreement-makes-our-scholarship-stronger

That is exactly what Trump wants. Another victory for Trump.😡

He looks so sad! God bless this community.

Need to get Zaljko Ivanek to play him in the movie.

Is there a demonstration today? What time?

Resignation is not resistance. You must be willing to risk unjust consequences for what is right. Cowards don't come out on top, and his actions only reinforce the agenda of the Executive Branch.

Can someone ELI5 the whole situation in a way that a VT grad (like myself) can understand?

![gif](giphy|lQVBdPrAlwKAHoLZd1|downsized)

That signs says, “[s]top the DOJ.” Normally the world wants or welcomes, “justice,” but man these are wild times 😕

Don't let the door hit ya in the ass on the way out!

Is this guy used to be working for or with Harvard University? Stay away from Harvard

Awwww poor millionaire. Must be nice

Not my president

Trump/Youngkin, via BOV pressured him to agree to dismantle DEI a couple of months ago. He could have stood up then, if it was indeed something he believed in, and said "Sod off, I'm not going to be the agent of your malign agenda. I resign." That might have indicated leadership worth rallying around. Instead, it is alleged, he did some things to give the appearance of compliance but without making the substantive changes the the BOV demanded. He wasn't fooling anybody, not even the mouth breathers at the Jefferson Council. Some DEI positions were renamed or rebranded but as of June 28th the college of arts and sciences website still listed a person with the title of associate Dean for DEI. Notwithstanding what might be very legitimate questions about the efficacy of those programs and the actions of the people charged with carrying them out, if these initiatives were important to Ryan he could have stayed and fought for them, for research funding, for a academic freedom, etc. The school would have rallies around those ideals. We now have to do without a sympathetic president.

Good riddance.

Bye Felicia

What a loser. Hes trying to claim he's doing it to save other people's jobs?? Trump will get rid if them anyway

Im sorry but this looks like AI

If Republicans get what they want, that's all we'll see on every network in a few years

That’s his motivation, but I worry he mistook the fact that they’re calling for his resignation as *the* issue, rather than just one domino in a whole line of stuff they’re going to continue to knock down.

And also kids on student visas. The Trump admin was threatening to unilaterally cancel the visa of every foreign student there. I went to UVA for grad school. It's a big school with a lot of foreign students. This would have destroyed their academic careers. Any kid there on a scholarship would also likely have had that scholarship stripped from them. There's a lot that the federal government can do.

Everyone knows if you cave to a bully they just leave you alone after that

Is sweater vest our next president? Or does he bring in George Allen or similar? By resigning we are now open to terrible leadership...how could he resign. Couldn't he comply with DOJ enough...Harvard seems to be working through this.

I agree 100% x's a million with your statement! Unfortunately, my anger and actual hatred ( something I've felt for very few people and historical occurrences) really don't help me. I want to go crazy riot on All they're about. Instead I will get to every protest and anti Right Wing happening that I can. I believe the statement that, Hate cannot change Hate. I really can't love those fucks though. I imagine Jesus would have a tough time loving & forgiving them and the Netanyahu's of our world. These are horrible times in the U.S. Our country has ALWAYS had plenty fucked up about it (especially historically) BUT no President has ever been as fucked as the current asscandle! AND his supporter's can fuck Off in a big way

I'm sick of the people he's threatening. I wish someone would say MAKE ME asshole!

I think he’ll end up on the board. President is kinda nuts, but a bunch of really off the wall stuff has been happening lately, so it’s not completely inconceivable Edit: Ah schucks, hes already on

Youngkin just replaced 4 members of the board days ago. They were going to oust him regardless. Let’s hope that peaceful protests commence.

Why don’t you like him?

Amazing how you can be so creative and know what sounds letters make - honestly that's more intelligent than I expect from people like you

It’s taken from the NYT story 🤷🏻‍♀️

Your account is 3Hrs old, it’s far more likely that YOU are ai…

I know the photographer. It is not.

Yup everyone getting crucified non stop on tv

President Ryan's Resignation Email

“All tyranny needs to gain a foothold is for people of good conscience to remain silent.” ― Thomas Jefferson

I'm disappointed, especially as this sets a terrible precedent for other universities. However, I'm also incredibly grateful for President Ryan for his leadership over the past seven years. I wish him and his family all the best.

Devastated and disappointed

Ugh. Can’t blame him, but very sad the world has come to this.

Hokie here. Fuck Youngkin and Trump

The toady that will replace you will allow all that you fear to come to pass.

Who am I going to run with now?

This reads as such an honest assessment by a man who clearly and dearly loves The University. My thanks for the leadership and the care that you brought to your job. And only the best to you in the next chapter. Time to enjoy your family and get out of the limelight.

This is a dark day for uva and for all universities. Fire BOV next Jan!

This sucks. Out of curiosity, is there anyone else who thinks his replacement will last about 10 months till the new governor replaces half the BoV, this of course assuming spanberger wins? Like am I missing anything here with this theory?

Here is the Instagram account of the woman who pressured Ryan to resign. It would be awful for folks to umm leave public comments: https://www.instagram.com/pnjaban?igsh=MWF1aWFmem9udnV1cA==

Trump and Youngkin want to destroy a premier institution. Shame on them both.

I understand his selfless reasoning, but I truly resent the heavy handed bullying from the republicans in Washington and Richmond in forcing his departure. I thank him for his contributions to UVA

I just saw the letter too and it seems everyone knows exactly what he's talking about.. I can tell he's hinting at something about trump but I haven't been keeping up with what UVA is doing ... Why exactly is he resigning??

The Trump administration are just puppets for the horrific white Christian Nationalist movement. I hope they all burn in hell.

An honorable Virginian and University alumnus, through and through

https://www.wahoos4uva.com/ to fight for UVA!

Trump keep destroying lives of good people

Trump is such a cunt

Heartbroken about this 😢

As an outside observer he wouldn't have been fighting to save his job. He'd be fighting to put a stop to this tyrannical madness that has swept over the country.

Why the hell do people keep giving in to this shit

OOS alum. Please give Spangberger Assad numbers.

ps: Fuck Trump

He should have stood up for what he believes. So disappointed.

Wow, true integrity in this time, its so refreshing. Also Quixotic, learned a new word.

sic semper tyrannis :(

I understand why people do this.. but this is exactly how they win, isn’t it? Trump wants all good people gone so 2025 can install their lackeys. Can’t this dude do more inside the system?!

Dictatorship

Why he resign?

Coward, all those things are going to happen anyway.

When you support discrimination through DEI and fail to stop antisemitism on campus, you lose your job. That's how it works.

![gif](giphy|lQVBdPrAlwKAHoLZd1|downsized)

Cuccinelli is a prick

What kind of chickenshit heroics are these.

TLDR; let me make an excuse to not fight and make things harder for all of my peers 🙄

No one can stand with a man who doesn't take a stand.

Can we have no heroes? Ryan, what a putz. In a position of power and influence. Would Trump have given up? Why is Trump so much braver than leaders on the left?

Fuck every sentence of this poor-me letter. It's almost as bad as the one he wrote calling out the physicians blowing the whistle on Craig Kent.

Fuck that... fight.

Would be great is Liz Cheney left as well. Unhinged activists have hurt free speech on grounds and Jefferson’s vision for the university.

Reverse discriminator got canned 🤷

Good job Mr President Trump!

And this was going to happen no matter what- and now he just wants to look like the martyr!

Larry Sabato, founder and director of the UVA Center for Politics, on Trump's university compact: "No college with integrity would ever agree to Trump’s demands to limit speech in order to secure federal $. Yes, it’s extortion."

Preach, Larry.

Dr. Sabato is one of UVA's most distinguished and respected professors, and his opposition carries a lot of weight. At this uncertain time for academic freedoms and the resilience of our democratic institutions, it is very important that UVA refuse to sign this compact and work together with other universities to respond to this administration's attacks on higher education. Both the Faculty Senate and president of the Student Council have[ argued](https://www.29news.com/2025/10/03/uva-community-reacts-federal-letter-calling-adoption-white-house-agenda/) that the University should not sign onto this compact. I hope that the Board listens!

I’ve never been a big Sabato fan for reasons that don’t matter right now. This is changing that view. This is a prominent person standing up and saying what is right, knowing it will likely have negative consequences to him personally. Well done, sir, and wahoowa.

He's right. Who knows if his point will carry the day.

Thank you Director Sabato

Glad Dr. Sabato spoke up. Many agree the compact is unconstitutional. Best thing I've read on the matter, brilliant analysis: https://balkin.blogspot.com/2025/10/the-art-of-replacing-law-with-deal.html?m=1 Two important bits: "The point here is to turn “benefits” to which universities are now entitled under federal law into “benefits of this agreement” which the university agrees in writing to give the Justice Department the power to suspend." And, "all universities have to do now is do nothing—no accepting the compact, no counter-offers, nothing—and the government will be left with no more power to coerce and control the First Amendment-protected activities of major American universities than it has today."

Pretty brave. I hope the toddlers over on the Jefferson Council don't fire him

Our Supreme Leader King of Intimidation Extortion Coercion NDAs Out of Court Settlements God Bless USA 🇺🇸

I am not sure that organizations that sit on billion dollar endowments while raising tuition annually are pillars of integrity. The same UVA would have no problem charging you 100k for for degree that might pay 60k a year and tell you that unlike all other debt, you will carry you student loan debt to the grave.

"No college with integrity" welp, we're screwed.

Typical SNOWFLAKE indoctrination camp !

I sat in on a luncheon where Sabato spoke a few months before the 2016 election. He assured us all that there was zero chance Trump would win and that the apparent closeness of the race was just the media needing a horse race. Still haven’t forgiven him for stirring that false sense of complacency. I agree with the commenter above who called his commentary “milquetoast”. Sabato is locked into an older way of thinking and detached from the reality we find ourselves in. Just my two cents

Why does it cost so much to send a child to college, where they are not taught the college courses they are signed up for. Why is the school more interested in changing the mindset of our children than to teach them for what they are paid. Why does a college need government subsidies for it to function. Why if the college receives government subsidies, is the school not be required to be politically neutral.

Don’t use federal dollars

Track me too! 😭

Larry has engaged in the same kind of milquetoast, conventional-wisdom, horserace calling both-siderisms that got us into this mess. I'm not very interested in anything he has to say, as right as he may be on this one point. He didn't help before and this isn't helping now. Sabato, the Miller Center, and UVA are a joke. Another casualty of our slide into totalitarianism.

I don't think it's clear at all that the Jeff Council "has argued" that the U should not sign; I see no evidence of the positive statement "the university should not sign." At all.

Thanks for listing the voting information!

Well the "Biden Switcheroo" was one of biggest self-owns in political history. Just think about what might have happened if Biden had announced he wasn't running mid-way through his term.

Then, you must have forgotten the role James Comey played about 11 days before the election. Ironically, toady, the same Comey is now a criminal defendant following his politically motivated investigation and arraignment by Trump's handpicked prosecutor. Law of karma...

The First Amendment exists, but people with the integrity and the balls to enforce it don't exist.

Why not? Those dollars come from taxpayers. It's not Donald J Trump's personal set of funds.

I completely disagree with you, and I am very grateful to Dr. Sabato for his courageous and admirable stance on this issue. He has long been very vocal in his criticism of the rise of anti-democratic political forces, and the Virginia GOP even called for an ethics investigation into him in 2021 because of his vocal opposition to President Trump and his attempts to overturn the results of the 2020 election. Also, the Center for Politics has done a lot to promote democracy and civic education, and, in the run up to the 2024 election, Dr. Sabato was very outspoken about the threat that a second Trump administration would pose to our democratic institutions.

His reputation and authority as a scholar was built on his determination to appear unbiased in his public statements. He did an admirable job of that. I expect the same statement would come from him if there was Democratic control of the government twisting the balance of power in a similar way.

And what good did his polite little soundbyte do? Zero. The time to fight for democracy has long passed him by and he's about as much use as those muppets that sit in the opera box hurling insults - by which I mean to say it does nothing. Thanks for nothing, Sabato.

You're right. Thanks for the correction. (I updated the comment.) I was mainly referring to Gardner's argument that, "Rather than say we are signing on, I think what they should say is that we on our own...think these are important issues"

I’m not talking about that election

“Antidemocratic” and “censorship” could also include the ridiculous mission statements required by applicants to the universities for the last decade. What’s your take on those?

Right! Time flies in this dystopian world of 1984.

Please explain how the statements some universities require of applicants are "anti-democratic."

He can’t; he won’t.

University of Virginia students holding 'antifascist' 'flag burning' event to protest Trump order

Oh look, a fox news link. Totally unbiased!

Veteran here. Burn the flag proudly. It’s what I signed up to be a barrier for. And the country needs it right now.

I’m a veteran and have had zero real interest in burning a flag until Trumps ridiculous order.

I personally think of flag burning as one of the most patriotic symbols we have as Americans. How sad and pathetic that UVA admin feels the need to come out and publicly deny this display of free speech.

we should be proud of these young people. this is important.

No longer a student myself, but I fully support the rights of students, or anyone else, to express these opinions and that I am proud of them for exercising it. And, of course, it is a net good for society for people to occasionally do things that agitate establishments and institutions. This would also be true even if it was speech I don't like. Rights wither away to complacency if they are not tested. _Sic semper tyrannis!_

Millions of American men and women fought against and defeated fascism under the American flag. Burning it is protected speech and your Constitutional right, but it is remarkably idiotic optics if your goal is to protest the unconstitutional, illegal, un-American actions of officials. Never, EVER cede the flag to those who wrap themselves up in it but undermine our rights and democracy.

Cool. Nice work.

Trump chose to make flag burning an issue because he knows most Americans don’t like to see the flag burned. People opposed to Trump should not play into his hand. They should protest with the American Flag proudly flown not burn it.

Did this event actually happen? The article refers to it still being in the planning stages. I was out of town so didn’t check it out myself.

I wonder if Fox has picked up my "Piss On Charlie Kirk" pictures I put on all the dog piss spots in my neighborhood. Dogs pissing on Charlie Kirks face all day! A perfect memorial!

Lock them up! It’s illegal to burn the flag now!

Yawn. I’ll protest like our enemies when I have common cause with them.

Would they burn pride flags if Trump said they couldn’t? Communist flags? Palestinian flags? No? I wonder what the difference is…hmmm.

Well, time to rescind UVA’s federal funding. Cant wait for it to happen.

I hate NOVA!

UVA is shit

I mean, it is a flag burning barbecue protest based on the flyer. But the guys statement is so fire ____________________________________________________ In a statement, Wolff, who said he is a graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy, argued the flag burning was not an act of disrespect but a symbolic protest against what he described as Trump’s unlawful attempts to undermine democracy, chill dissent and overstep executive authority. "The president does not get to say what the law is; that is solely the province of the judiciary," he said. "He must be reminded that his political enemies are not military enemies, and that he cannot stop free speech, expression, and democracy," his statement continued. "Many of us, including myself, signed the dotted line and agreed to fight for these ideals. The actions this president has taken, between deploying troops to "war zone" cities and planning to use the military against dissenters who he terms the "enemy within" are far more disrespectful to the sacrifices of current and former service members than any flag burning, which has long been settled as protected speech. The president does not get to overturn that precedent with an EO, and his attempts to intimidate dissenters and chill speech is disgraceful. The true desecration of our flag has come from the Oval Office."

It's actually a decently written article. The only thing biased is that they captioned a photo "Members of the Communist Party USA and other anti-fascist groups burn an American flag on the steps of the Colorado State Capitol on January 20, 2021" So, linking anti-fascists with communists? I bet the article's author didn't write that caption, a Fox editor did.

Fair and balanced

It actually seems pretty fair. Shocked me

Fuck yeah, brother

Right? Tell me I can’t, and I will…

Where did UVA admin do that?

using fire to burn cotton isnt even remotely on any scale of patriotism or service or productivity. i barely notice

At first I was excited to see my state motto in a random Reddit post but then I remembered that some members of r/UVA might possibly be familiar with the state of Virginia

It says this person is a veteran and his statement seems pretty good as to why he did it

How about flying it upside down? I have a neighbor who's been flying upside down since Trump took office, and I actually think it's quite appropriate.

we should burn the confederate flag and see what MAGA has to say about that

I know… the likely capitulation to Trump IS embarrassing. We should be fighting back way harder

The guy's a veteran. Did you read the article?

Infantilization is a form of ad hominem.

Dudes a vet, so go churdle his balls

It’s not. Here is the source from the U.S. Government, currently run by Donald Trump and Republicans, proving you wrong. Please take some time to reflect on the fact that you’re being proudly and objectively incorrect. Have a great day https://www.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/free-speech-flag-burning_1.pdf

You grow up.

Do provide your explanation, since you clearly have one that we lesser souls cannot possibly understand without your deep analysis.

Ah yes, more government coercion that is actually illegal and definitely unethical.

Odd, I thought Republicans didn't like big government

Didn't get in?

Cav Daily video: riot police break up UVA encampment for Gaza with pepper spray, batons and shields

Bro it looks like there are only like 12 protesters in this video and Jim Ryan responded by calling in the entire fucking police department in riot gear lmao.

This is a much stronger response than we saw in 2017 when Nazis with tiki torches marched the lawn shouting “Jews will not replace us” that’s for sure.

Nazis marching through the streets? All good buddy! Kids camping on a college campus? Holy fucking shit!!! Bring the pepper spray and riot gear!!!! -Cops apparently

Weird crime but I’m pretty sure if they protest without tents, they’ll still find an excuse to call the cops on them. I think we should start looking at the bigger picture

So unnecessary and embarrassing. There's way, way more cops than people sitting in the lawn. Could some faculty not have just gone and talked to them about how graduation prep needs to start? ~~I will say the Nation Guard being called in requires the governors approval. Did Youngkin command this, or did the University ask for this to happen? I somehow lean towards the former.~~ I still suspect Youngkin might've had a part in this but that's pure conspiratorial conjecture

This isn't a Camp-us, these are the GROUNDS! *fires pepper spray*

Shame on UVA. The only violence I'm seeing at this protest is police against students.

Jesus fucking Christ why do universities hate this cause so much

Police starting violence? A tale as old as time

Free speech is dead

There's a false rumor going around that UVA inly said no tents this morning. Not true. This past Wednesday, a protester was [interviewed](https://www.wvtf.org/news/2024-05-01/students-speak-chant-blow-bubbles-and-eat-pizza-at-gaza-protest) and she acknowledged that the agreement with the university was no tents.

Fck young kin and all AIPAC bought politicians!

Insane, especially considering the whole tiki torch event looked nothing like this. These cops are hired thugs, fuck them. Pepper spray is fucking inhumane and unnecessary

I truly don’t understand why people need tents to protest. Having tent encampments is the only reason these colleges are tripping out. It seems like a dumb line to die on. Protest all you want but let the tents go.. seems reasonable to me. 🤷🏽‍♀️

Police protecc corporate property.

Was that Go Knicks or Bo Nix?

PSA: [This](https://foreverpolice.com/how-to-get-pepper-spray-out-of-eyes/) is how you get pepper spray out of your eyes.

I attended many anti-war demonstrations in Washington DC during the Vietnam era. It seems like this police action was much like the way the Metropolitan Police special operations division would handle these kinds of things then. They would put the crowd on notice that they had to leave or else. Then they would come in with gas and riot batons and there would be a big melee and bus loads arrested. I think this current generation of demonstrators have to realize that when you fuck with the bull, you get the horn.

Y’all… when are we gonna the police are doing to much. Consistency!!! These are young adults camping out on their campuses laws and this is the response they get?!?!? Yes IT’s break the rules, but at what point does the rule not matter when this is the end all response. This is to much.

We will have trump next year because of these idiots who don't even know what they chant for. Privileged idiots I wish they can send them all to gaza to support Hamas there.

They're doing this shit everywhere. It should be fucking horrifying to any reasonable person, no matter how they may feel about the views of the protest. Stay tough, take care of eachother, and know that other students, grads, and faculty across the country are rooting for you, sending love, strength, and solidarity from their own campuses and encampments.

My god, the amount of satisfaction some of you people get from watching police brutalize defenseless/peaceful protesters is sickening. Free speech is dead, and you police-state loving boot lickers are the ones who killed it.

Why do Nazis get more protection than students?.... It's a really weird world we are in when the government cracks down harder on pro Palestinians than Nazis.

We really need to examine the level of fascist asshole we employed in a lot if LE agencies - stupid, power drunk and armed is a bad combo

If you buy a hammer everything looks like a nail. Cops have military grade weapons. So happy to have a chance to finally use them against people insisting the world stop committing genocide. Get used to this. More are coming.

If only there was a school shooter on site. The cops would never dare step 100 meters into the school.

There’s that good ‘ol ‘Murican fascism. /s

Peace in the Middle East secured 👍

Part of the reason for the response was the protesters inviting in outside people. The university said that created a safety issue and you really can’t blame them. FBI, VSP and others monitor discord and other sites protesters around the country use to organize. As soon as one gets shut down these outside groups plan the next school to go to. If it was only students and faculty they probably would have had more patience.

Interesting how all the universities cracked down at the same time.

Good, lol. Stupid asses

Who cares. Spray them, beat them.

take that you Goddamn nerds and your fancy smancy book learnin'! -the cops, probably

About damn time

I wanna say something but idk if I should

Instead of protesting for Palestine protest for a win against Virginia tech in football💀

When y’all gonna protest for lower college costs ?

Nothing makes you look more like a bad guy than breaking up a peaceful protest with violence.

No more safe spaces for them..

I never understand why this never happens to the militarized citizens who broke into government building years ago or when school shooters are rampant. Get some people together to talk about genocide and equality and American government sends in the dogs and water and pepper spray. Like didn't we do this to the Chinese Irish blacks in America already? We don't want to learn our lesson it seems.

Wonderful!:)

Shame on them

Saw protesters calling Jewish people Nazis....a bit ridiculous especially this close to the day of remembrance of the Holocaust.

We need Biden to answer for this hatred

The police aren’t our friends or protectors they serve capitalists and sorry to break it to you but you aren’t and never will be a capitalist class member.

Pigs doing a great job of ingratiating themselves with the community, as always. The beatings will continue until morale improves.

Hokies Stand with UVA Every Hokie stands with our brothers and sisters at UVA today just like they stood with us that fateful April. It’s a club we wished they didn’t join.

Thank you. If anyone can possibly relate to this insanity, it's people at Tech.

I agree. I am a VT alumnus but I remember how UVA stood by that day. I shall also stand by. Very tough day.

Thanks. It's sorely appreciated.

Thank you Hokies. We may enjoy the rivalry but at the end of the day we’re all Virginians

This Hokie sending love to UVA

Bringing the conversation back. I hope they find this guy soon. Hokies for Hoos.

Tech alumni here. Thinking of you all over at UVA.

VT Alum here that now lives in Cville area and calls it home. We are with you all the way. Hokies for Hoos.

Another Hokie sending love to our family in Charlottesville. Thinking of y'all.

Take care peeps. I hope they catch em real soon.

Hokie here. I have had the same feelings all morning as I did back in 2007 😢

We are praying for all of the Cavs and your families. Stay safe, look out for others, and please reach out to support systems (family, friends, campus health) if you have any concerns or just want to talk.

I am a Hokie, and I stand by all of you as you stood by us. Wishing well to the families of the victims. Thinking of you guys.

All the UVA students and affiliates I've known have a really strong pride and love for the university. I know many of you feel not only sadness for the individuals hurt and killed but a real sense of anger that someone would attack your community like this. It is a dark feeling and I'm sorry it has come to UVA and to Charlottesville again. - VT class of 2019

\#Hokies4Hoos

I'm sorry you guys got to experience this. I still remember ours... stay strong, UVA is bigger than this one event. Note, check the age of any Twitter account claiming to have info. People on r/cfb are claiming that verified Twitter accounts pretending to be media or UVA officials are making false claims, reporting sitings, and naming random football players a dead when they're actually safe.

Sending love to you guys in Charlottesville 🧡

Hokies neVer forgeT the support UVA gave us in 2007. We are here for our brothers and sisters whenever you need us. Wahoowa.

UNC Charlotte stands with yall

William & Mary stand with y’all

I remember being at tech in April, and now this time I was at UVA.

So sorry Hoo bros..

This Hokie stands with you Hoos.

My heart hurts for you, ‘Hoos. I was an alum in Blacksburg in 2007. UVA alums, please go to campus and provide a shield for the students. The media will be relentless in attempting to have footage and interviews. Students are trying to get through this plus classes and don’t need the disruption. Your Alma mater will be in the headlines for all the wrong reasons and it will break your heart. We are here for you and we understand.

Recent Hokie alum who grew up across the mountain from Cville, my brother’s an alum and my family still has season tickets to basketball… so sad for you all, the families of the players, and for the whole football team

Came here to say exactly this. Hokie here who was a student in 2007 so I know what you’re feeling today. It’s terrifying. Sending all of you love and prayers (and also voting for more gun control).

VT alumni here. Thoughts and prayers to all. If the game is still played 2 weeks from now I hope yall beat the shit out of us.

Thank you, Hokies. In the shadow of the sadness of these two sorrowful occasions suffered by each of our communities, Virginia Tech and the University of Virginia find comfort, mourn, and grow stronger together. My 💔 goes out to UVA Football, r/UVA, UVA Alumni, r/Charlottesville, once again suffering bright lives lost to tragic violence, now by gunfire. Praying for the families and friends of Lavel, Devin, D'Sean. 🤲🏽 May the students surviving this tragedy soon know peace and healing. 🕯️

My Hokie son and I are thinking of you Hoos.

VT alum here. Sending you Wahoos so much love today. ❤️

Sending love and energy from VT. Stay safe and support each other where you can 💙🧡

Another Hokie chiming in with my support. Everyone is stronger together.

Love to all of you from our entire Hokie stores’ staff and families. You always have a hug and respect waiting for you at our place.

From a Hokie, prayers go out.

I love each and every one of you and there's not a goddamn thing you can do about it. Pretty sure I'm paraphrasing a scene from "Scrubs" but I've never found a better blessing so that's kind of where we're at.

UVA alum and Hokie Mom, heart broken for the families.

We dont need your ""thoughts and prayers"" we need gun control

You would think this would be a good opportunity for BLM to represent..... wait what do they represent?

I was a VCU student at the time of the Tech shooting. I was gutted.

Hokie alum now living in the midwest, but always have the wonderful state of Virginia in my heart. So devastated to read the news this morning. Sending love to all of UVA and the community.

God, I just heard about this, and I'm in shock. hope all of ur are doing okay. My thoughts and prayers are with u.

I hurt for y'all. Sending love, hug your friends.

Wishing you all the best, Hokies have you in our thoughts, take care of yourselves

Unfortunately yes.

As a Hokie alum, I extend my support. Having been at VT during the events of 4/16, I struggle to articulate the heartbreak for the UVA community since last year. It should never have occurred, and it must never happen again.

And we will all prevail.

UVA Alumna Katie Couric on President Ryan's Forced Resignation 🧡💙

Sad day for UVA 🧡💙

DEI will be back at UVA once Youngshit is replaced by Spanberger and the Trump admin is gone And it will be permanent after that

Spot on statement. Also, Youngkin is a suckup toady.

Well said Ms. Couric!

Republicans are the party of chaos. Every accusation is a confession. They rely on these distractions so they can't be held accountable for the destruction

What did Katie do to keep Ryan from giving in to Trump? She and other alumni are only generating posts now, in the aftermath. Where were those voices and $s for his/uva legal fund a day ago, a month ago? This letter is too late and self serving. Step up before the quitting...not after. Silence is compliance Katie.

DEI is cancer.

Has Tina Fey weighed in?

The Trump administration knows that everything it is doing can theoretically be undone by the next administration. That they continue to govern like this is all permanent is really what terrifies me. I don't think they are planning to give up power without a fight. And I mean a physical fight.

I think this was mostly true pre-Trump. Trump shifted the party to isolationism and mercantilism abroad and authoritarianism at home. Edit: a stray period

Did you expect her to kidnap him? She can’t “keep” him from doing anything, nor is that her responsibility. She is certainly allowed to express her opinion about it however, and your whinging about her doing so is bizarre.

It’s honestly worse.

How do you fight 300 million people?

I mean powerful Rich alumni can make it known that all the donations are gone and they will donate money towards a legal fund that's exactly what Harvard did

Because only 70+ million people of those 300+ million made the small effort to vote against him?

A legal fund for what. Ryan's resignation (forced or not) was legal. Would a legal fund make him return? I don't thinks so...he must be fed up.

With the way democrats present themselves and promote (not) any young blood in their own party, I don't see them winning in 4 years. I've always said, Trump won not because he was so good, but because democrats were so bad. They handed him the presidency and looks like they didn't realize it even now. I see Vance the next president with no competition.

... This would have been before he resigned obviously

My love for UVA + tons of time during quarantine = my ~1.5 year long on/off project of building Grounds in Minecraft

damn this is sick

Dude you’re talented and dedicated

um...so how would one access this piece of beauty??👀

You streaked the lawn in Minecraft, didn’t you Squidward?

This is awesome! Great work man. Edit: Strike that this is actually the best post I've seen on r/uva :)

Post this on r/nextfuckinglevel this is the most beautiful thing I’ve ever seen

Any chance there is a download for this? Would love to play on it! Incredible work

This is legendary

could we get a seed?

We could have used thus for orientation this year

Thank you all so much for all the love! It made the many hours spent on this project worth it! Without further delay, here is the world zip file of what's constructed so far. The world file is on the current version of Minecraft Java Edition (1.16.5). The world is far from finished, but the plan is to eventually build all of Grounds along with some off-Grounds areas and convert the file into a server in the future for all to tour and enjoy! [https://drive.google.com/file/d/19e2r3kJoLi-9yMeHATEQVQ-PxFPpLci1/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19e2r3kJoLi-9yMeHATEQVQ-PxFPpLci1/view?usp=sharing) If you use Windows, download the zip file, unzip it, and place it in: %appdata% > .minecraft > saves Then open your Minecraft Launcher, and start Minecraft! I am not sure how the process works for people who use Apple OS systems as I don't use Apple OS personally. So far, the exterior areas currently constructed are the Rotunda, The Lawn (Pavilions I-IX and Pavilions II-X), West Range (Dining Hall, Lawn Rooms, and Hotels), the Chapel, Alderman Library, Clemons Library, Special Collections, Peabody Hall, Monroe Hall, Garrett Hall, Cocke Hall, Old Cabell Hall, New Cabell Hall, Rouss Hall, Bryan Hall, and McIntire Amphitheatre. I haven't been able to build many interiors for buildings other than the Rotunda unfortunately due to time constraints. I also have to add all the trees that occupy central Grounds at some point. Thank you all again, you're the best! Wahoowa!

This is amazing! Did you also do the interiors?

I love this!

This is insanely well done

I’ve seen a lot of people attempt this but I think yours comes closest to getting the proportions right, it’s amazing!

Do you have a map download

So awesome! Well done, my friend.

This is epic!!

Im not a huge minecraft person but this is dope

absolutely incredible !!!!!!! so impressed. kudos to you

props to you - god I miss this place

a lot more impressive than the real grounds hahaha

This is great, I’m curious why you used wool instead of brick?

I haven’t been to grounds since last March. I finished off my thesis and graduated remotely. It’s amazing how this could bring me so much nostalgia. It’s as if I’m right there again. If that’s not a testament to how well done and accurate this is, I don’t know what is. Edit: if I could be granted one request, would you consider adding The Dell to this (the green space behind the old dorms)? That is and forever will be a sacred space to me; might as well be the center of the universe to me.

Drop the world file my G

Wow. This just made my day. SO frickin talented!

This is insanely awesome

Ironically, you don't have enough creepers on grounds

Thank you!! That means a lot!

Thank you so much! That really means a lot to me! Adding small additions over a long period of time was my strategy and it made all the difference!

I would like to show my kids UVA through their favorite game…

I added a zip file for the world download below in the comments!

Haha!! No comment

Thank you! I'm beyond honored to be that OP :)

Of course! I added a zip file for the world download below in the comments for y'all! And thank you!

No need to pay, I added the world zip file in the comments for y'all! Enjoy!

Of course! I added a comment with a zip file for the world download of what's built so far!

I have not gotten to many interiors yet due to time constraints, but hopefully more will be done in the future! I focused mainly on exteriors first as the first phase of world building.

Thank you!! I made sure to take time with it, it's amazing how much can be done over time!

Looking at the proportions was really important! It was difficult at first, but a lot of things fell into place in terms of size and proportion of buildings compared to other buildings! I'm amazed a lot of things so far were possible to build in Minecraft tbh

Yep! I added a zip file for the world download in the comments

Thank you! All the time put in so far has been really worth it!

No, you're awesome!

Thank you for the support!! All the love for my alma mater and my fellow Hoos

I miss it too :( The alumni lifestyle

I built a LEGO Rotunda!

Wonderful! Do you have directions for this creation? It’s fabulous!

I’d pay for the instructions on this

This is SOOOO cute!!! I love it. You might be able to add some shrubbery along the lower grey wall using piece 24855 and a similar strategy you used for the deciduous tree :) or just sticking some flat 1x1 circles on a 4070!

Awesome! Future ideas include adding a streaker lol or more seriously build the Corner similar to the LEGO Diagon Alley. I’d bet if you make a large size replica of the Corner the library would love to host it, and people in the future can add updates as the store front changes, removing the old stores and presenting them separately to show the history. But idk maybe I’m getting ahead of myself, that require some finances I don’t have, maybe there’s a club or active community on campus that would love to take up the challenge

Jefferson would totally collect legos if he were around today. Nice !

I love the foliage. Very nice touch.

I’m surprised Lego has never made this a thing tbh - it looks great!

Extend it out to have the Lawn, Academical Village, Homer Statue, Rouss, Cocke, and Old Cabell. This is super cool though

Woah Ive streaked there

I see you used grey roller skates to avoid the BOM being over $1000 if you had used white. Great compromise in my opinion!

Do you have the instructions for this? Also, you should submit this to LEGO Ideas.

That’s my goat right there attaboy Ben

I have got to know how to build this

Lego Masters o7 I would buy a VCU lego set too

are you that lego guy who was on that show with his grandpa

But I'd prefer a cake.

this brings me joy, thank you

I like how you took pictures in the rotunda

“What is this? A center for ants? How can we be expected to teach children to learn how to read if they can’t even fit inside the building?”

Please share this! I would love to add this to my Lego Architecture collection. (I’m great at following instructions, not so great a coming up with my own.) I’d even pay to get it on rebrickable or BrickLink.

I appreciate you

Why stop there? It could be extended to New Cabell, Wilson Hall, Bryan Hall, Nau-Gibson Hall, Minor Hall, The Amphitheatre, Garrett Hall, and more.

unfortunately it would never get past 😞 the money's not there

how is US history 101 going ?

You sure? The Rotunda is a UNESCO world Heritage Site, meaning it has relevance.

you can look at what Ideas accepts - things are recognizable around the globe (telephone box), cute and nice for display (polaroid, cat) or licensed sets that do gangbusters (jaws set, nightmare before Christmas) not many people outside of UVA grads would cough up the money for this. display building sets don't come cheap either

"I don't really mind the government's new death ray, because it hasn't hit me yet."

Trump voters are too stupid to understand such an advanced cartoon

They think they’re shooting the death ray lol May their day of reckoning come

Too accurate. Lol.

PRES. MAHONEY ANNOUNCES UVA REJECTS TRUMP COMPACT To the University of Virginia community: On Monday of last week, Rector Rachel Sheridan and I shared a message with the community regarding the proposed Compact for Academic Excellence in Higher Education. We were asked to provide comments on the proposal no later than October 20. Today, I sent the letter below to the Secretary of Education and to White House officials. The letter confirms our core values and commitments while expressing our view that federal research funding should be based on merit. I want to thank personally the Faculty Senate, Staff Senate, Student Council, and many other members of our community who expressed their opinions on the proposed Compact, through the online form we provided and other means. Your thoughtful feedback shows a profound care for the University and a strong commitment to its future. We will continue to work to strengthen free expression and free inquiry, protect academic freedom, ensure affordability , promote intellectual pluralism, and maintain institutional neutrality in an increasingly polarized world. I am grateful for your continued dedication to the University and I look forward to working with you on these vital projects. Paul Mahoney Interim President University of Virginia _ _ October 17, 2025 The United States Department of Education Washington, DC 20202 Dear Secretary McMahon, Ms. Mailman, and Mr. Haley, Thank you for your letter inviting comment on the proposed Compact for Academic Excellence in Higher Education. We wholeheartedly agree that “American higher education is the envy of the world.” We also agree with many of the principles outlined in the Compact, including a fair and unbiased admissions process, an affordable and academically rigorous education, a thriving marketplace of ideas, institutional neutrality, and equal treatment of students, faculty, and staff in all aspects of university operations. Indeed, the University of Virginia leads in several of these areas and is committed to continuous improvement in all of them. We seek no special treatment in exchange for our pursuit of those foundational goals. The integrity of science and other academic work requires merit-based assessment of research and scholarship. A contractual arrangement predicating assessment on anything other than merit will undermine the integrity of vital, sometimes lifesaving, research and further erode confidence in American higher education. Higher education faces significant challenges and has not always lived up to its highest ideals. We believe that the best path toward real and durable progress lies in an open and collaborative conversation. We look forward to working together to develop alternative, lasting approaches to improving higher education. Sincerely yours, Paul Mahoney Interim President University of Virginia

Sweet! Note the Oct 20 deadline is for feedback and signature deadline is Nov 21. Let's get to Nov 22 and see what's up. In the meanwhile, **VOTE Y'ALL.** Given the structure of UVA, etc, we need a governor and state attorney general to protect autonomy of our university. Early voting is super easy, find your exact location here: https://www.elections.virginia.gov/casting-a-ballot/early-voting-office-locations/

We will not succumb to tyrants 👏🏼

This goes hard

So relieved!

I don’t think Secretary McMahon, Ms. Mailman, and Mr. Haley will understand the intent of what was written in this letter.

A thoughtful, necessary and classy response to a really dangerous proposal - thank you for that.

Stephen Miller and his Unite the Right bro Richard Spencer have particular hard ons over UVA for some reason. I don’t think this will be the last salvo. But for now, we can exhale.

Thank you President Mahoney!!! Sanity at last.

Let's gooooooo!

That is a pretty wishy-washy rejection. It doesn't overtly say no anywhere.

That's an outstanding response. Mr. Jefferson would be pleased, I think.

As it should be. I particularly appreciate the open and positive framing of the message in President Mahoney’s letter. Wahoowa!

This letter is not a rejection. It is basically outlining all of the areas of agreement except one, that it expects or seeks better treatment for funding. If there is something that the letter does not present as an agreement, what is it?

Better late than never

Miyares doesn't care if UVA goes broke. He needs to lose his election. If you can't vote FOR Jay Jones, vote AGAINST Miyares.

Did the other universities actually reject the compact? This definitely leaves the door open to sign on to an altered version

Sic semper tyrannis ✊

It’s a W and I’ll take it. Republican interim president and youngkin appointed BOV. I like how it stakes out the moral high ground by saying that seeking special favor, as the compact offers, is wrong.

Very civil haha

Right? What would have been best is if all the "invited" Universities had responded with a joint "fuck no" in response, instead of the somewhat muted individual trickle that's happening now. There was an opportunity to make a statement, loudly, and instead they're all whispering. I'm happy with UVA saying no, but wish they and the other schools had spoken in solidarity and with a stronger voice.

I thought it was great. Turns the admin's own "merit-based, no DEI" framing right in their own face.

Just vote for Jay Jones. He's our best shot and honestly who GAF about some dumb old text messages. This "leak" is a well timed political ploy. Vote on the issues. No one is perfect.

Wording varied in each case, intent clear in all cases. 4 of 5 private universities were first to respond, prob easiest because they have greatest autonomy, then UVA, first 1 of 4 public. Situation more complex for public, and each is uniquely entwined with their state. I am grateful for President Mahoney's response. Next up, time to vote y'all. Let's get a governor and state attorney general who will fight for UVA.

“Sic Semper Tyrannis” was what John Wilkes Booth shouted leaping from the balcony of Ford’s theater after he put a bullet in Abraham Lincoln’s brain. Lincoln was assassinated by a conspiracy of Virginia and Maryland Confederate sympathizers. I guess Boothe thought Lincoln was a tyrant.

Yes! United they stand, divided they fall. The big law firms were pressured individually, and they separately quietly caved.

I wish they'd more overtly said no

Couldn't agree more and I'm so tired of the hypocrisy.

UVA performs gender reassignment surgery on children as young as 5. When I graduated UVA Med ‘86, giving sex hormones and performing genitalia surgery was considered comparable to Nazi Germany’s experiments testing drugs and procedures on Jews and homosexuals. UVA Med! Go woke and go broke! As a Board Certified Pediatrician and Adolescent Medicine, i used to be proud of my University MD degree. Now I’m disgusted. And no, Jefferson would NOT be proud of age 5 Lee getting his penis cut off to become Leah.

I know this is a bot account, but just in case anyone doesn’t know, “Sic Semper Tyrannis” is the state motto of Virginia. It’s very fitting for the best university in the world.

Me too. It’s as if they have to pass some kind of purity test that only exists for the DNC.

GoAskAlice9...Stick to the facts. In January 2025, UVA Health announced the suspension of all gender-affirming care for patients under 19. This specifically includes medications like puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones, as well as referrals for surgery. This decision followed a federal executive order and guidance from the Virginia attorney general. New patients under 19 seeking this care are now referred to outside providers and existing patients may also be referred elsewhere. UVA Health continues to provide gender-affirming care, including surgery, for adult patients aged 19 and older. If you're disgusted with your UVA MD degree, then do the medical profession a favor and retire.

It has also been the state motto since 1776… so Booth doesn’t get to claim it. That’s an original Revolution slogan.

Yo fam, People who don't get science will never learn from a subreddit comment. Nor would they grant humanity to people we love. This troll did undergrad half a century ago. HALF A CENTURY. Great-grandpa territory. If a wife, kid, grandkid, or great-grandkid were loving and present, dude would not be trolling. They are absent with reason. **Block and move on.** Also, you are awesome. Big brain, huge heart. Wahoowa!

Dean Ozment's abhorrent treatment of transfer students I honestly have no idea how Dean Ozment is still employed as the transfer dean at this point. I have NEVER met a transfer student who did not experience condescending, classist, and passive-aggressive behavior from her. The stories I've heard, especially from students of color or students who do not come from money, range from absurd to abusive. During my transfer orientation, she literally made a student cry! Before we went in, the orientation leaders warned us that Dean Ozment was an unpleasant person (although they used... different wording), but I couldn't believe what I saw in person. Personally, I transferred from a community college and she refused to accept several classes, despite *all* of the registrars and several other deans assuring me that *they* thought the classes should have been accepted with no problem. Unfortunately, Dean Ozment had the final say. I emailed her asking her to please reconsider and attached an 18-page appeal detailing the courses and their overlap with existing UVA classes. **This woman literally responded, "I would not be surprised if the community college you transferred from had different standards for what's acceptable."** Ma'am???? I've generally tried to avoid her, but she just reached out again placing a hold on my account because I don't have enough credits earned (because she wouldn't let my classes transfer) and that I would need to take summer classes. Y'all... I am quite literally mid-summer session at an abroad UVA location. She said it's a precautionary measure and that she'll remove it when classes end and I pass. I have a 3.9 GPA ??? How do you guys survive her :')

I hope this blows up in the UVA subreddit. Gave you an upvote. Fortunately I never had to deal with the credit transfer situation, but nonetheless the university has to deal with its own rules. If your courses are similar to what is offered at UVA then you deserve the credits. Plenty of UVA students took physics in community college during summer due to how much that class sucked. Take it to a higher Dean!

Update - she wrote me an email saying, "Your tone sounds quite stressed. If you feel upset after reading this letter, then I recommend that your immediate action to call TimelyCare to talk through your emotions and other things that may be contributing to that stress." Lmao? Go to therapy if you don't like it?? Bless

contact the university ombudsman

Worst person I’ve ever had to deal with at this school, completely agree

Agreed. Her “advising” was extremely poor to the point where I dreaded meeting her.

Glad I'm not the only one who feels this way. She has single handily made my experience at UVa miserable. I know this school has excellent administrators/advising and it's so sad to know that transfer students who often need the most support have to deal with her rude attitude and complete disregard for students' needs.

I would really communicate this to the Transfer Advisory Board. They are super great people and help relay concerns.

**Update:** these concerns have been referred "to the relevant office for review and action." I'm so sorry when I read about this and the many other challenges that transfer students face. We need to do better. P.S. I have shared these concerns with colleagues in leadership. Please allow a little time for consideration.

I'm so sorry you're going through this. I've never met this person, but have been on the sub for several years, and this issue keeps coming up. Some thoughts for what might be done for the big picture (but not sure how it would help OP)... 1. If there is not a transfer student association or club, look into creating one. Become a resource for each other, and help each other navigate the transfer process - and help build the community and make the connections that it sounds like are lacking for transfers into UVA. 2. Set up a meeting with President Ryan. If he is not available, in the fall, go to one of his open houses as a group and talk to him about your concerns. 3. Get the student member of the Board of Visitors involved. He or she has a literal seat at the table to the governing body of the University, and can raise concerns from various groups of students. 4. Go to the Cavalier Daily and tell them about the issues - send them to this sub to search the history of complaints. Get them to investigate an ongoing problem here. 5. Get others who have had issues and go to both the ombudsman (as TraderJoeslove31 suggested) as well as her boss, the dean of the college, and the provost. The community college system in Virginia is very proud of and uses the guaranteed admission to 4-year schools as recruiting tool. I know many people who have taken that route. If this woman is belittling the hard work you do there, that needs to be known and addressed. Enjoy your study abroad and welcome to UVA - please don't let this sour your thoughts about attending here!

Graduated in 2019….Dean Ozment made me cry after every time I met with her :,) She then tried to say I didn’t have enough credits to graduate on time with my class, to which I had to jump through hoops to prove I had enough transfer credits to graduate. She was rude on the phone when I proved this to her. Needless to say, it was awkward when I had to shake her hand at graduation a few weeks later 🤷🏾‍♀️

Never talked to her in person. But I think she just doesn’t get back to ppl in emails in general? This is very different from the rest of the university

For those wanting to go above her head you should first go to Rachel Most, Dean of the Undergraduate College.

Please get in touch with someone. I'm sure plenty of people will back you and submit statements as well

I had taken a medical withdrawal from UVA and it took 3 days (after classes had started) for me to be able to meet with her and get her to sign my re-entry form.

She was my dean for 3 years and we had met before but she had no idea who I was or what my academic situation was. The only time she really displayed any interest was when she found out I got into one of the 4+1 programs. Her whole demeanor changed and I could tell that she wasn't happy for me but rather she was happy she could say that one of the transfer students was in a 4+1.

She was by far the worst administrator I had the displeasure of dealing with while at the University. She is incredibly unhelpful, and when I would reach out for help she would consistently act as if I was trying to pull a fast one on her rather than offer advice and help me. I ended up doing the Batten MPP 4+1 tract and in preliminary conversations with her she insured me that I would be able to walk at graduation (May 2022) even though I would need to take a class in the summer of 2022. Around April, she completely reneged on her promise and told me I would not be walking. This led to a very stressful process where I had to go to Jim Ryan ‘s office, in which he swiftly allowed me to walk with my friends. She does not advocate for her transfer students, rather sees our needs as a burden. She is an embarrassment to the school.

Transfer student here. 100% agree.

I dealt with her in 2018/2017. She told me “you’re taking too many science classes” and made me drop a few classes I really wanted to take. I had a 3.8 GPA in environmental science at uva and came in with a 4.0 from a junior college. The major wasn’t rocket science and I showed her I never got anything below an A- in any math or science class. Still made me drop a couple classes in my last semester after doing well the previous year. She told me she didn’t want me to fail a couple of classes and make me miss my deadline. She has a background in music lol.

this fucking whore is a demon spawn I swear to god I just sent her the nicest email asking about the language requirement and she just gave the most condescending response which had nothing to do with the content of my email.

I’ve had to meet with her a few times and it is amazing how incompetent and uninformed she is for someone whose literal job it is to advise new students on the path and classes they should be taking. My roommate is also a transfer and she’s had multiple credits wasted from ozment telling her the wrong classes to take for certain requirements.

She is the reason I had to leave uva for a semester, while i was going through this she was gaslighting me about my mental health all while being condescending. it makes me incredibly angry to read all this as a hispanic student that she has treated students of color this way

Dean Ozment helped me with a grading issue for a class and I ultimately got the higher grade that I was supposed to get in the first place. But I have also heard some unpleasant things about her.

I am also a transfer student, but I never talked to her(although she asked all transfer students to make an appointment). That sounds horrible especially since I plan to overload in the next two terms（as I cannot afford summer or winter classes）... Is it something hard to apply for?

Contact the Provost.

Dean Ozment treated me really well as a transfer. She even emailed my professors and forced them to extend my due dates after I was going through some horrific family events. Despite this, I hear horrible things from everyone else.

i didn't have any very bad experiences with her but i wouldn't say working with her was pleasant by any means

She was my advisor as well. I never really met with her, but when I tried to schedule appointments to talk about courses she would never respond anyways lol. I would just meet with my major advisor.

Only ever had one experience with her, was about my first year writing req. I missed the exemption form and emailed like a year after I transferred. Tbf I transferred during Covid and literally didn’t even have an orientation. Anyways, my situation was my own fault for waiting so long but she sent me the most passive aggressive response. She was basically like why are you bothering me with this, you should have gotten an email about this a year ago (honestly I don’t think I did) if you didn’t do it then you have to take an ENWR. I think she did give me another contact in charge of the writing stuff and when I reached out to him he was just like yeah send me a portfolio it’s fine. So rude for absolutely no reason.

If I may add this whorish woman does not respond to emails. how tf do you get away with this in an academic setting? I am asking important questions pertinent to my graduation and literally have gotten 0 replies 3 times. one time i called her out and she said she thought it was spam because I started with "Hey," &#x200B; &#x200B; WT actual fuck

dealing with ozment right now she is such a fucking bitch

This lady was so odd. I’d ask her a specific question and she would somehow find a roundabout way to never answer my question. She was consistently rude and condescending. Emailing her was a joke so I opted to call instead and she missed our call. I wanted to graduate early and asked if I’d be on track, but she suggested I’d walk with my cohort, (winter graduation doesn’t even have a celebration so that was an irrelevant comment) and • “enjoy my summer vacation” (I am a first generation low income student who was working- what vacation?”. • She also said I should instead spend a semester taking exploratory classes, such as music and art. (as if I had money to take a “fun semester”) If President Jim Ryan and admin are interested in diversifying the student body, they should highly reconsider Dean Ozment’s appointment as transfer dean. She has consistently proven she has no regard for transfer students and aims to make their lives more confusing and frustrating.

Transfer students undergo a transitionary period when moving to a new school— ANY SCHOOL — it is a really well documented phenomenon. Look up “transfer shock.” So many university folks see this as CC students just failing to grapple with different “standards” … and yet typically if there’s a dip in grades, they quickly rebound. All of this is to say, don’t take her shit. Find someone who knows the policy and get your credits accepted. This is so so wrong for someone in this specific position to be behaving like this.

And then there's me, the one who's never had a bad interaction with her. Sure, her intro series is super condescending, but she seems like a nice lady. I typically don't interact with her, tho.

i avoided her bc of the bad rep she has, but she emailed a prof telling him the let me retake his class even tho he didn’t want to let me. so i owe it to her on why i graduated in general. i was on hold so many times and was released. never met her in person! also, it was unclear i had to have an appointment, so i never reached out. somehow made it out! hang in there, i guess keep the mentality that they work for you, they’re supposed to help YOU.

Wait I experienced this also and heard about it but to see it was posted this month is very telling to how bad she really is.

This is late as hell but I feel so affirmed here. Do you know what she fucking did? She told that I could take specific community college courses over the summer (I took a total of 9) and transfer them over. I literally went over that with her three times to make sure that there was no ambiguity in what she was saying, that those credits would transfer. By the time they transferred I found only 4 credits transferred since I had maxed out the number of credits I could transfer. I should’ve looked more carefully, but do you not think your ACADEMIC ADVISOR SPECIFICALLY CHOSEN FOR YOU would’ve pointed that out after you went over it with her THREE TIMES???? That’s about 600 dollars and many weeks wasted, thanks dean

I think it blew up... lol

Holy shit. That needs to be reported bc the gaslighting is off the charts. It’s her job to aid students, not whatever this nonsense is. I’d talk to the transfer student council as well and work on starting a petition to hold an assembly / town hall with folks with similar grievances. Unfortunately UVA is rife with condescension towards transfer students, esp from the CC circuit. Even tho many of those CC classes are taught by those who come from ivy pedigrees and actually care about their students learning and building their lives. Much luck!

hey i’m a little confused, there is usually a sheet that tells you what courses transfer from specific colleges… don’t know if this will help but i’ll share my personal story: i had a case where i needed a class transferred in that wasn’t included in the original credit-eval transfer, but i wasn’t entirely shocked because the course was brand new and had just been approved for transfer credit like a month before my final summer session began before transferring (meaning i had already been accepted to UVA for the approaching fall). when i was told that they could not find anything to validate this change in their records, i reached out to my former dean of engineering at my community college and she dug up the email correspondence between the officials at UVA and her showing it’s approval. that was the ONLY way i was able to get that credit approved. personally, i have had a heck of a struggle with this school with respect to personal problems. my father has cancer and ended up being in & out of hospital during the last month of classes. i tried to appeal to the dean for a late withdraw, and they told me that since nothing “unpredictable” happened after the withdrawal date, that they would not be helping me. so to anyone out there with a sick parent, make sure you can forecast exactly when they will get sicker! what a bunch of bs

Likely the Provost. That’s generally who admissions officials report to.

I’m very sorry about your feelings. She is but one person and I hope you can let go and enjoy your time there. Fall in love 🥰

I would add that I believe the BOV have their emails listed on the website. I would send it to their actual email addresses, and include as many details and (if you can get them) corroborating stories from other students. You could even include a news station’s email address in the same email. That way when they receive it they will see that someone external at least knows about the matter and that they’d better be ready to answer questions. Don’t be afraid to make your case about the spirit of community college - that it is meant to provide an accessible path to higher Ed for those that don’t have the same privilege (money) as others, and what type of message it conveys when officials engage in behavior that could be perceived as classist or racist.

Jesus, I'm so sorry to hear that. CAPS is definitely not perfect, but one of the therapists did a few sessions with me and provided some really good references to psychiatrists and therapists in the area who took my insurance. They might be worth reaching out to if that sounds like something you're interested in. I'm sorry you're going through this <3

Sounds like you should have spit on your hand first.

Fr. It’s embarrassing how incompetent she is at helping us when she has a narrow job description

I've had very similar experiences with her over the past year. She's made multiple tone-deaf comments about "fun semesters/classes" when she knows 1) I'm a nontrad, low-income student and am literally just trying to get out of here with a degree as quickly as possible, and 2) that SHE singlehandedly is the reason I have to stay (and pay for) an extra semester because she refused to let my online classes transfer (despite other deans AND the registrars approving them). When I reached out to Provost Ian Bauchom about her behavior, he apologized and said he would investigate it. He also allowed me to change my transfer advisor to someone else--if you're struggling with her, I recommend doing messaging him! Good luck <3

Ah, I see. Thought maybe she was an asst. dean of admissions. If she’s asst. dean within a college, then yes, she reports to the dean, who reports to the provost.

UVA could be next This is Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish student who had a legal student visa to study at Tufts university. She was a full bright scholarship who was getting her PhD. She was recently detained by ICE and sent from Massachusetts to a Louisiana ICE detention center. There is video evidence of what happened to her. In the video, several masked policeman grabbed her and forced her into a vehicle. For the next few hours until she reached Louisiana, her attorney was unable to locate her. They stated her visa was revoked because of “terrorist activities”. The terrorist activities in question? Last year she co-wrote an editorial for her school newspaper asking for peace for Palestinians. She wrote things such as “We affirm the equal dignity and humanity of all people” and she urged people to take a close look at the issue. I’ve seen people complain about these types of posts on this sub saying that if it happened at another university then why should we care? What does it have to do with UVA? Well firstly we don’t need to be a Tufts student or a Columbia student to care about these types of issues. We just need to be human. And secondly, we would have to be naive to think UVA is somehow untouchable. We need to stay aware and alert. We need to look out for those around us. Even if you believe that this issue is too big to tackle (which I mean come on, political majors are some of the most popular at UVA. Why back down now?? Practice what you preach!), at the very least what you can do is stand in solidarity. To show that UVA is a college that stands up against this type of bull crap. The only thing I would say be cautious about is voicing things if you’re an immigrant. Rumeysa was detained for writing an editorial. Please be careful if you’re an immigrant and you want to participate in politics.

First amendment had a good run. Unless people start marching en masse fast, we're cooked.

Will be next. You think bringing in Cuccinelli is a one off?

Whatever people's views of the subject matter, we cannot tolerate "Terrorism" being blanket defined as any speech the government does not like. Furthermore, if due process is not given to all of these people being taken by ICE, then our system of law is officially defunct. The constitution gives all people within the United States certain legal rights and privileges, and just because you are not a citizen does not mean that the government can revoke those rights at any given time, especially not for a legal resident. The government can deport people, but it is up to a judge to determine whether this person's actions justify deportation or not.

Not being an immigrant won’t make you safe. The end goal of this administration is total authoritarian oppression of their ideological enemies.

It *WILL* be next. They are coming after all academia. An ignorant population is a controllable one. Also, I bet Trump blames them for Trump University going under and is being a petty bitch.

We ought to be vocal I think, we’re not exempt from their gaze, after all we’re one of the 60 universities which have been told that we need to remove our DEI initiatives

This is truly sad

https://youtu.be/gtTLu7CDOJA

This blows.

Spineless, gonadless uva is scared of youngkin and orange butthole. Money & religion are the root of all evil. UVa is not a religious institution so it's easy which of the two holds influence.

ECHO. CHAMBER.

No one is willing to take any actual action, so it’ll continue.

People on a visa do not have right to attack, harass, block from entry Jewish students and professors. or incite others too. How hard is that to understand?

Less people who support a terrorist organization that screams death to America and actually killed Americans? How is that a bad thing?

Literally nobody is against this

Bruh she was literally supporting a foreign terrorist group, FAFO

She should go to Gaza and protest there. That should work out great

As an immigrant myself, I understand the difference between being a guest in a country and becoming a positive contributor to it. Even I can see the importance of respect, adaptation, and showing gratitude to the place that opened its doors. If someone leaves their home country to come to the U.S., it's usually for opportunity, safety, education, or freedom. But then, to turn around and reject or disrespect the culture that gave you that chance? That’s hypocritical. It’s like saying, “America is good enough for me to benefit from, but not good enough for me to respect.” No one’s saying you need to erase your identity or forget your roots. But when you come to a new country, especially one as diverse and open as the U.S. you have a responsibility to adapt, learn, and live in harmony with others, not to dominate or divide. The U.S. isn't perfect, but it's held together by shared values, not just open borders. So if life in your home country was so much better, why leave? And if you did choose to be here, why not help build something better instead of trying to reshape it into the place you left behind? I know a lot of you will come after me because of these statements, but I'm saying this with respect, and as an immigrant.

Fuck yes! Doing the Lords work. ICE is killing it (but also need to step it up)

First they came for the Turkish nationals who called for the destruction of Israel But I did not speak up, for I was not a Turkish national calling for the destruction of Israel And yeah after that, colleges got a lot nicer

Just a piece in a editorial? Nah. There's more. Who was she talking to?

If you are going to be outraged, be outraged with facts as they emerge. She will have her day in court in front of an immigration judge. The government has not tipped their hand in terms of specifics of her alleged conduct and that's what's going to be key. A bunch of us on the Internet arguing without any basis in fact is completely unproductive and useless.

These are Glenn youngkins people. Not surprised

You all need to leave your echo chamber long enough to realize you are NOT what the majority of American agrees with. If these people come spewing antisemitism and being a dick on American soil they need to be deported. If you agree with them then you can leave, too. For the rest of America; it time to grow a backbone bone and stand up against this ridiculousness. UVA has become a cesspool of liberal thoughtlessness that will jump on board with the “fight” of the week. Be thankful you live where you do and quit trying to create crisis. “Stand up and speak out” are repeated in these posts… stand up against what? How about you enjoy your 90k a year education, go to class and have a little pride in where you live.

Fuck these jihadis. Get them gone.

Here's the piece that Ozturk wrote: [https://www.tuftsdaily.com/article/2024/03/4ftk27sm6jkj](https://www.tuftsdaily.com/article/2024/03/4ftk27sm6jkj) I can see the counter position here. As a student in another country on a Visa, you're a guest. A guest who does not have the right, but is being extended a privilege studying in our country. Just as you would not go to a party and offend the host or piss off their friends (allies).. you should probably do the same in the case of student Visas. Americans first amendment rights are just that. The 1A nsrines and protects Americans. You're only her eon a visa.. that is a fragile arrangement that you should be mindful of.. bc if it is revoked.. yeah.. you're gone. Sorry.. just stating the obvious here. Don't even get me started on the whole ,"From the River to the Sea".. which is literally calling for the extermination of the Jews. Just associating with that mantra in a positive light is endorsing and supporting genocide.

I wonder if the current loophole is that the constitution applies to us citizens and since she is not a us citizen then she is not covered by our freedom of speech? Im not saying thats how it should be, but Im thinking maybe thats how they will frame this if its argued.

Confused why any citizen be afraid of being deported? LoL

Absolutely. No matter what side you’re on, no matter who you support, this will always be the distinction between whether you’re on the opposite viewpoint or whether you’re in favor of a corrupt government. Even if you’re pro Israel, a trump supporter, a republican or whatever, you should at the very least acknowledge that what happened to this student was unjust according to the basis of the constitution. And quite frankly what I don’t understand is that people will frequently argue that immigrants need to assimilate, immigrants need align with American ideals. But when somebody like her exercises freedom of speech through peacefully and professionally expressing a controversial thought in a school newspaper, suddenly she’s not guaranteed any rights. In the court of law, even potential murderers have protected rights. Even they receive due process. This woman, whose only issue was expressing an opinion, was quite literally treated worse than a potential murderer.

right. Mamoud if he was on a visa and if this wasnt being done a year after the fact I could be convinced deserves to be revoked and removed. Maybe. it would require a hell of an arguement but i could see getting there. But my concern with it was (and has proven to be valid now because of the Ozturk situation) that it would be an excuse to combine anti semitism with anti israel speech to squelch free speech. Its not a brilliant plan. it relies on absolute brain dead sheep but it seems like we have enough of those in the country that it works. They will not understand the moving goal post until theyre being effected directly. it will be "of course we report terrorists" and then "of course we deport people that dont like us" and then "of course we arrest citizens that start trouble" then "of course we arrest people who dont support our divine mandate"

I tend to agree with your second part, but for your first part, would you be ok with terminating the student visa of someone who protested for segregation, openly carried a Nazi flag, and argued that allowing black people to vote was a mistake and advocated for repealing the 15th amendment? These are all 1st amendment protected activities for citizens, but I'd imagine would be grounds for removal of a student visa should a non-citizen be participating in this type of speech.

This comment didn’t even make it a month before the administration started letting ICE put U.S. born citizens in detention without any form of due process.

Exactly. And in the future when people look back at this time period and look at the different view points of various colleges, what message will it send when there’s no record of student support from UVA? Even if we can’t directly change anything, we should at the very least stand in solidarity against these human rights violations.

That’s a limiting belief. We can convince people to take action and we can create change. 100 years ago nobody in their right minds would believed one day we would have a black president. But we do now. People need to stop accepting the status quo in order for progress to actually be made. If you keep believing that “well nobody else cares about it so it’s just gonna keep happening so this isn’t my problem” of course it’s going to keep things the same! Then you would be no better than those people because you too are accepting the current circumstances. I get it if you’re an immigrant and you’re afraid of speaking up, that is absolutely understandable. But if you’re in a safe position to stand up for this issue then why not? Do what you can and see where it takes you.

HELLO I AM HERE TO STATE THINGS THAT DO NOT APPLY TO THE PARTICULAR CASE AT HAND said the spammy troll

No one, immigrants or otherwise, does. That’s what normal court is for. If she can be found guilty of any of the things you say, that needs to be proven in court first — just like everybody else. *Then* comes immigration proceedings. This is completely backwards.

she literally just co authored an op ed

But did she do that?

cool, but that's not what the disappeared woman did.

You're against due process and free speech, so you are un-American. Would you like to self deport or shall we have you arrested and forcibly deported?

People have been saying she supports hamas. Is there any single proof of that. I’ve read her article, she has not supported hamas that I know of in any way.

USS Liberty, also American activist has been killed by the IDF before, so your tax money goes to them bud. Not your kid, or you. Them.

>Even I can see the importance of respect, adaptation, and showing gratitude to the place that opened its doors. So one one hand you want her to adapt to the country's standards and ideals. But when she aligns with American values by peacefully using freedom of speech to voice an opinion, suddenly that's a problem? >But then, to turn around and reject or disrespect the culture that gave you that chance? That’s hypocritical. It’s like saying, “America is good enough for me to benefit from, but not good enough for me to respect.” Please explain to me how her advocating for peace in Palestine is "Disrespectful to American culture." And why exactly do you believe that she has to align with the current US government's stance on foreign politics? Recently the Trump administration has become more and more comfortable with siding with Russia. Do you want all visa holders to align themselves with this position too? Do you believe they deserve to be mistreated and deported for believing that Russia shouldn't be attacking Ukraine? Is it really just ideal to you for her to have to act like a perfect robot and agree with every single thing the US government believes in just because she's a guest here? Why do you believe it's unreasonable for her to be granted some basic protections such as freedom of speech? >The U.S. isn't perfect, but it's held together by shared values, not just open borders. Yeah and one of the most fundamental values of Americans is freedom, particularly freedom of speech. So when she's trying to fit into that value then why is it a problem? Be honest and say what you really mean. You don't want her to "align with American values" (Whatever those could mean). You want her to align with the Trump administration's values. Most Americans aren't even pro-israel. So if anything she fits American values quite well. Anyways, all of this is irrelevant anyway because all of this isn't even the main issue. The main issue in question should be a concern for all Americans regardless of where you stand on Palestine or Israel. The concern is that Rumeysa was not given due process. She was physically snatched off the streets by a group of masked people, and then sent all the way from Massachusetts to an ICE detention center in Louisiana. Nobody knew where she was or what happened to her. Even her attorney had no idea where she was. Don't you think it's scary that we're living in a country where all it takes for somebody to shove you in a car and ship you half way across the country without anybody knowing where you are is a vague claim that you engaged in "terrorist activities" without further elaboration?

The United States is not a country with "guests" unless they want to be guests. You can come here, live here the rest of your life: you are American. We are not Germany, you will never be a gasterbeiter for years. Decades. It has never been the immigrant or minority communities that have sought to divide the United States, it has always been the establishment seeking to crush change.

So fuck the 1st amendment then? I guess that means the second amendment can go too because we gotta be consistent. So with that I have to assume you're cool with them taking guns away? Peach, preach.

She very explicitly did not call for the destruction of Israel. She supported a two state solution. “I’m fine with the first A getting destroyed to protect a foreign nation” Zios are so bothersome. Keep your fascism in your rapist ethnostate

I'm impressed with the fact that you know to cite that quote while simultaneously completely missing the point of it.

Definitely more to it! She’s very unlikely some innocent student who wrote an article. Regardless, no one knows beyond what the press has put out.

Sen. Mark Warner warns that if Trump administration can pressure University of Virginia president to resign, "they can do it anywhere"

Thank you to Face the Nation's Margaret Brennan for inviting Senator Warner and asking him about the recent events at UVA. I was happy to learn that Brennan is a UVA graduate herself!

"For him to be threatened, and literally, there was indication that they received the letter that if he didn't resign on a day last week, by five o'clock, all these cuts would take place," Warner said Sunday. When asked if the threat was explicit, Warner said, "It was that explicit."

Sen. Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, on Sunday condemned what he described as an "outrageous" pressure campaign by the Trump administration amid a federal investigation into the University of Virginia, which led to the resignation of its president, Jim Ryan. "This is the most outrageous action, I think, this crowd has taken on education," Warner told "Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan." "We have great public universities in Virginia. We have a very strong governance system, where we have an independent board of visitors appointed by the Governor. Jim Ryan had done a very good job; just completed a major capital campaign." **Read more:** [https://www.cbsnews.com/news/mark-warner-university-of-virginia-president-resignation-trump/](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/mark-warner-university-of-virginia-president-resignation-trump/)

Well maybe stop fucking voting for Trump's nominations Mark!

Jim Ryan was just the first domino. How is Warner only now finding his voice? Where was he when Trump admin began bulldozing all of our rights MONTHS ago?

Did he ask for a donation at the end? I am so sick of the Democrats talking about all the problems and the solution is always to send them money. I realize we have elections coming up this year and next but perhaps if democrat politicians spoke through their actions without asking for handouts, people would support them more, but what do I know

Ya think, Mark? How brilliantly insightful of you! Did Warner also warn that if Trump violates emoluments, there’s a risk he might be able to do it again?

Mark and Katie etc should have created and funded a legal defense fund for the UVA Pres 2 months ago. Gnashing teeth after the resignation does not help. People with money and power know how to use those items when they want to help. Watch actions not words.

"Sen. Mark Warner warns that if Trump administration can pressure University of Virginia president to resign, "they can do it anywhere". I missed the show. Did he also explain that water is wet?

Then it's time to finally get serious about this Warner! Way past time.

Warner sat by as Biden’s lapdog for four years as the Biden administration put our country in peril. Both Warner and Senator Kaine served the Democrat party rather than Virginians.

Warner is part of the problem . He is a billionaire that is so out of touch with working people . We need someone to look out for us . How about someone new

Anywhere that title IX is being blatantly violated, abso- fucking- lutly.

And Warner will write a very strongly worded letter just like the rest of his party!

Ryan defied his board and tried to cover it up until some UVA whistleblower called him out to UVA LAW graduates in the DOJ.

It wasn’t Trump it was the Board of Visitors BOV who Ryan defied nd tried to cover it up.

Justice Sotomayor in her dissenting opinion on the birthright citizenship ruling made a chilling statement that says all that needs to be said about the Trump administration: "No right is safe." Words have meaning, let's stop the "No Kings" protests. Trump does not aspire to be a monarch. Aided and abetted by an obsequious GOP and a majority of SCOTUS, Trump aspires to be an authoritarian, despotic dictator in the vein of Vladimir Putin, Victor Orban, Xi Jinping and Kim Jon Un. A government run by executive order instead of by acts of Congress in accordance with the Constitution. He is openly threatening universities to withhold federal funding if they refuse to kowtow to his agenda and has done so to Harvard and Columbia. He will do the same to UVa. All this from a twice-impeached, convicted felon, and sex offender. Take this narcissistic, demented and pathetic excuse of a human being at his word when he said "You don't have to vote again." Wake up America!

Ding ding ding. If Mark runs again he won’t have my vote. He championed the TikTok ban, which gives Trump absurd control over social media. He also normalized Trump’s openly fascist nominees.

Sen. Warner has been quite vocal about this administration in the past few months.

Warner has been a Democrat lapdog to his party for years. He stood by and behind Biden as he took our country into war, recession and ill repute throughout the world.

I don’t know how you expect them to maintain even the positions they currently hold if they don’t get money. I doubt he did, but the amount of money being used to hold up the right and displace the left by billionaires and oligarchs is unreal. But you can just complain when the left loses any position and it can’t be saved at all. In fact, we might already be there.

Here’s the transcript, no call for donations that I saw. https://www.cbsnews.com/news/mark-warner-virginia-senate-face-the-nation-transcript/?intcid=CNR-02-0623

That’s what I thought but it’s not so straight forward. My understanding is that UVA needs to be represented by the state Attorney General, or the AG needs to authorize outside counsel. Miyares* is doing neither of those. EDIT: BOV also needs to authorize outside counsel being engaged. They’re not doing that for Ryan. So Ryan would not be able to source legal defense for the university. He would have to sue the BOV as an individual, and I don’t think he wanted to do that given the threat of funding cuts.

Yep , Warner and Kaine are loyal to billionaires. They only claim to care about the little guy during elections or if a camera is nearby

So you’re saying you wouldn’t vote for him in a primary? Or are you saying you wouldn’t vote for him against a Republican candidate?

Virginia was not particularly well-served by either Sen. Kaine or Sen. Warner. Kaine voted in favor of 8 Trump cabinet nominees and opposed 13. Warner voted in favor of 6 nominees and opposed 15. Will have to see how they vote on Trump's "Big Beautiful Bill."

How does the TikTok ban give Trump control over social media? It's a congressional statute that doesn't give the executive discretion over how it's employed. And, Trump is literally violating the ban as we speak - he's refusing to enforce it.

He still confirmed a lot of Trump’s picks 🤷🏻‍♀️

I didn’t say they shouldn’t get money but I don’t see any communications coming from Mark Warner that doesn’t have a donate button on them. Another way to approach it might be to follow the lead of Jamie Raskin who DOGE was in high gear was sending out recommendations to send freedom of information act request and other things that people could do to fight back without asking for money. That’s my point

They are vehemently against it.

warner is a tech millionaire who got rich in telecommunications from information and connections he made as a congressional aide. do a keyword search in the linked document for the word "murder" to see who he pardoned for that [https://rga.lis.virginia.gov/Published/2005/SD2/PDF](https://rga.lis.virginia.gov/Published/2005/SD2/PDF) kaine similarly came to the aid of rich donors when he established biscuit run park and bailed them out of their badly failed investment [https://c-ville.com/taxpayer\_state\_park/](https://c-ville.com/taxpayer_state_park/) funny how the same name shows up in that article and warner's list of pardons neither warner nor kaine is the friend of the little guy, they work for the wealthy just like trump does

I’m not sure how your cognitive dissonance allows you to accept these thoughts at the same time. You literally described how it’s being implemented at Trump’s discretion, and also said it’s not up to his discretion.

Kaine is Hilary Clinton’s poodle.

An Open Letter to Chi Alpha at UVA

Edit #1 - It goes without saying that I am a little late to the party here. Trying to work through the lower end of the comments to understand if anyone's violated the community standards. (Though, still pretty encouraged by the comments at the top.) That said, I want to point something out; as before, when the political kettle started to bubble over, it was very important that we kept the discussions civil. Harassment, or insulting off-topic commenting was discouraged and removable. It still is. So, as you start to post comments directed at groups of people, consider that those groups of people may be on reddit, and part of this subreddit. Therefore, your messages intended to insult without promoting the spirit of debate are not welcomed, and will be warned/removed. Religion is a topic that is razer-sharp, which makes it especially perilous to monitor. But please, **please**, consider the individual that is the target of your comments. If you are trying to hurt him/her/them, **please reconsider, or if you have to express your thoughts, take it offline.** **We do not want to emulate the reported transgressions of XA by being a community of exclusion to people who had nothing but positive experiences at UVA, no matter what org they were in.** \----------------------------------------------------- (⊙＿⊙') \*rolls up sleeves\*

Alex if you read this thread know that there are Christians at UVA who don’t give an f about what Chi Alpha has to say about homosexuality and who will accept you with open arms, no forgiveness no repenting necessary because there is absolutely nothing sinful about love.

Hey Alex, I’m a UVA alum from several years ago and can’t believe this crap is still happening. If you want to join a Christian community that is actually welcoming, consider the Canterbury group at St Paul’s Memorial Church (that’s the big one on the Corner by Bank of America). It’s small but a LOVELY group of people. One of the priests is a lesbian woman and amazing UVA Religious Studies professor. Really good, open people there without any of the crazy, hurtful nonsense.

That's actually a violation of UVA's policies for what CIOs are allowed to do. [From StudCo's website](https://www.uvastudco.com/criteria-for-approval), UVA (not StudCo, the university itself) requires all CIOs to have a nondiscrimination clause in their constitutions that reads: “\[ORGANIZATION NAME\] does not restrict its membership, programs, *or activities* on the basis of age, color, disability, gender identity, marital status, national or ethnic origin, political affiliation, race, religion, sex (including pregnancy), *sexual orientation*, veteran status, and family or genetic information.” (emphasis mine) Barring you from leadership just because you aren't heterosexual constitutes restricting your activities within Chi Alpha on the basis of sexual orientation, which is a flagrant violation of the University's criteria for CIO status. If you're comfortable doing so, I strongly recommend you bring this up with StudCo; Chi Alpha isn't allowed to discriminate along such lines and that much needs to be made clear to them.

Chi Alpha engages in some of the most toxic recruitment I've ever seen. When I was a first year my roommate and I were the only non-christians on our hall (Jewish and Muslim respectively) and we were constantly harassed to attend events under the guise that they were non-denominational when it was not the case. They guilted my friends who were members for drinking and speaking with men to the point they felt they had to leave the organization to live the life of a normal college student. This stands to only radicalize or ostracize.

The fact that XA can have pillars of real community and real responsibility yet turn away an incredibly wise and compassionate person from leadership just because he loves someone of the same gender is very hypocritical. I thought that following Jesus meant being inclusive to everyone, not taking someone who has been an amazing leader up to that point and telling them halfway through the semester that they can't lead anymore because they aren't straight. I have been a member of XA for two years, but this semester is my last. The people who I've met are amazing, but some of the things that the org as a whole stands for are just too much. I've definitely made lifelong friendships with some of the people in Chi Alpha and have grown more in my faith, both of which I am very grateful for, but there's no way that I can morally justify staying in a group who doesn't value the voices of LGBTQ+ members in the community. Also though does anyone know of any openly affirming fellowships at UVA? Because I'd love to join.

Thank you for sharing this. I’m so sad Alex had this experience and likely other LGBTQ+ students had this same experience as well. No one should feel excluded in a group, especially one that preaches love thy neighbor.

This makes me insanely angry. We need to create a petition to revoke XA's CIO status immediately. Per the latest University-CIO agreement: "A student organization is ineligible for CIO status when the organization restricts its membership, programs, or activities on the basis of age, color, disability, gender identity, marital status, national or ethnic origin, political affiliation, race, religion, sex (including pregnancy), sexual orientation, veteran status, and family and genetic information."

Fuck that. Looking beyond the actually “values” of the organization itself, that must violate some sort of CIO agreement with the University for discrimination.

This reminds me of my experience with Young Life at VCU. Not nearly the same level of discrimination, but it made me feel pretty cruddy nonetheless. After going through a full semester of leadership training, I had my interview to become a leader and was basically told I wasn't popular/fun enough for the high school students I'd be leading. This was a punch in the gut. As a high schooler I had wished I had leaders who were more down to earth and approachable. The over-the-top energetic style works for many people, but some kids don't respond to that, and I was disappointed to learn that Young Life didn't care to cater to those people. This experience turned me off from the entire organization, and I haven't looked back since. It's no secret that these organizations can be cliquey. It's making Christianity seem exclusive, which it shouldn't be, and they really need to be better about this. Thankfully, I view my experience with Christ as more of a relationship than a religion, so leaving organized religion did not ruin my faith.

I was active (and in leadership positions!) in a Christian fellowship for 2.5 years and was constantly trying to hide my bisexuality. I never had the courage to tell those in the fellowship about who I am, and they still don't know. I never heard explicit hate speech against the LGBTQ+ community, but I was constantly afraid that I would be "found out" and unceremoniously kicked out. There were so many discussions about how we needed to "love the sinner, hate the sin", which tbh just left me feeling like who I am as a person is wrong and disgusting, and that I can't be loved for just being myself. I know that phrase can have good intentions from many Christians, but it always made me feel so alienated and confused. This letter really resonated with me! Christian fellowships on Grounds have a lot of work to do. I've found a good mix of well-intentioned, kind Christians and some that are just straight up awful people. I hope that some change happens so that any future LGBTQ+ Christians can find a home and be welcomed. (PS - if you're one of those lovely people, my DMs are open and I'd be happy to chat!!)

As a Christian, I didn't join XA, and I'm glad I made the right choice. This is absolutely disgusting. XA if you're reading this, you all need to reevaluate! This is discrimination!

I am SO sorry this happened. It’s truly disgusting. I’ve been a practicing Christian my whole life and regrettably got sucked into XA my first year. And you know what? It was the worst religious experience of my life and they are a cult. I have since found another (smaller, denominational, liberal) Christian group and my life/faith has been SO much better. I am not part of the LGBTQ community, but as a strong ally I could not fathom being part of a group that was so blatantly homophobic so I quit after first year. Please just know that there are liberal Christians out there who fully support and love you, no matter who you are or your sexuality.

Chi Alpha's basically the BYU of UVA

Such a toxic organization from everything I’ve heard

this is horrible, I’m sorry you had to go through this.

They’re a cult.

XA is not Christian, it’s a toxic, borderline cultish organization at UVA

Proud atheist here. Say what you want about TJ, but he built this school with every intention to dissuade theology from playing a role in student life. Thanks TJ. On another note I’m deeply sorry you lived through this, I hope you’re surrounded with good people from now on out that aren’t stuck in the Middle Ages.

anyone else not surprised ? religion is such a cult

oh HELL yes

Thank you for being willing to share your experience<3

I'm sorry for your experience. They should have given you a chance instead of immediately dismissing you. I'm also sorry to see all the people calling Chi Alpha a cult and toxic in this thread. I tried it out for a couple weeks and had a great and welcoming experience. I ended up deciding not to join, and they were very gracious about it. I know others who left Chi Alpha smoothly as well. I don't see anything wrong with them encouraging their members to not drink/practice abstinence if it's a part of their religious beliefs. One post in this thread is saying that women are discouraged from talking to men, which is definitely not true. Most friends groups I saw in Chi Alpha had both men and women. And even though I am not in Chi Alpha, I remain good friends with several of the people I met during my time there. I guess I'm just shocked to see how people had such different experiences with Chi Alpha from mine. I think it's fair to require a leader of your club to subscribe to your club's beliefs. If a Muslim organization doesn't want to allow a Christian to be their president, that seems completely fine to me. If the College Republicans don't want a member of the DSA to be their secretary, that also seems completely fine to me. If Chi Alpha believes that one shouldn't be in homosexual relationships, then they should be allowed to exclude those in homosexual relationships from being a leader. (On a side note, I would be very surprised if Chi Alpha did not ask a leader preaching Catholic doctrine to step down from their position. I would also be surprised if Alex was entirely kicked from the organization. Chi Alpha probably just didn't want him in a leadership position.) Where Chi Alpha failed in this situation is that they didn't give Alex a chance to repent or defend himself. According to his comment here, he wasn't even in the relationship when he was booted, which makes the organization's missteps even more egregious.

Is is just open letter season nowadays or what?

They are related to the Assemblies of God, which are pentacostal. That should be a clue. Sorry you learned too late.

“XA disagrees with my beliefs so they should be kicked off grounds!!!” /s Honestly. Respecting and tolerating others’ beliefs goes both ways. Find another Christian organization that better fits your needs. I know I’ll be down voted like crazy, but I’m fed up. A group is exercising its rights to believe a certain way, and so is this individual. XA isn’t going to change, and they shouldn’t have to, just like this person doesn’t have to change. We don’t have to make a big deal out of everything. Just move on to bigger and better things.

Much respect to them. Hope they are able to maintain their authenticity instead of giving in to sanctimonious circlejerk

To all of you calling for XA's head on a pike. You are the reason why half of this country is staunchly anti progressive. You progressivists do not want to be accepted or tolerated. You want to force others who fundamentally disagree to change their views and policies to align with your own. You are not asking for freedom, you are attempting to take other's freedom away. This LBTQ+ groupthink is like a cancer that is rapidly spreading and it commands that you must conform to it or be condemned.

OP, just out of curiosity, were you forced to leave Chi Alpha completely or did they simply ask you to step down as a leader? From your letter, it sounds like they only wanted you to step down from a leadership role. Wouldn't it make sense that they want to be consistent in their Christian beliefs by having leaders that didn't engage in what they view as "sinful" behavior? &#x200B; Based on other comments, they seem pretty staunch in their beliefs to where they even frown upon premarital sex. I imagine if another leader of theirs engaged in heterosexual, premarital sex they would be forced to step down, too. NOT to say that you actually had sex with your previous partner (maybe you did, I don't know, but it doesn't matter), but, the point being, they're very strict in their beliefs. That doesn't mean they hate you because you're gay. They just don't see the act of engaging in the behavior as acceptable and congruent with God's laws. There is a difference. &#x200B; I don't know much about Chi Alpha. Maybe they are a super-strict, cult-like organization, and, if I was you, I wouldn't want to be a part of such a group in the first place. Why any LGBTQ+ person would want to be a part of something so strict is a bit beyond my understanding. I know there has to be other, more inclusive Christian groups out there, right? Also, your letter says you're a third-year. Is it also the third year you've been a member of Chi Alpha? Did you not already realize what kind of organization they were your first year or even your second year at UVA?

Hi Alex, I’m a queer woman and one of my best friends told me what happened at UVA. Thankfully, I choose not to attend, but I have seen how ignorant and disgusting the majority of UVA students are in regards to all minorities...Dismissing and disregarding issues of race, sexuality, gender, etc to have 17th century values live rent free in their minds. I’m truly not surprised this happened but I am appalled anyone would support an act of blatant, illegal discrimination. I will happily use my contacts at the ACLU and the NAACP to have them disbanded immediately. They should not be affiliated with the university unless everyone wants to get sued here. You’re a brave young man and I commend you for your strength in the fact of adversity. God bless you Alex, you are loved always, and my inbox is always open. We have mutual friends and I’ll make sure you get my number. Love, a fellow LGBTQIA+ Christian who is incredibly proud of you ❤️🙏

Class of 19 here. When I was a first year my chi alpha small group tried to pray my gay away, literally. I quit it shortly after that. Some of my gay friends stayed though and actively tried to make themselves be straight. It's sad and it's a cult

This. I am a member of the LGBT+ community who left the church for reasons similar to this, and I honestly believe it had more to do with how fellow Christians made me feel about my identity than the teachings of the Bible itself. I really hope that as The University and the world continues to grow people become more accepting of those different than them, since the church still holds a place in my heart.

Love Out of Marriage is sinful. So is sex or did something change? At UVA…

Heather Warren is my major advisor and she is the sweetest, most genuine professor I have met so far!!

I just suggested them above! I'm a bi woman, and I adored St Paul's when there. As a born and raised Episcopalian it felt like home anyway. I remember I brought a friend there, and they just so happened to bless a gay couple during the service haha. It left a good impression.

Only issue is that they “asked” to step down and OP complied. They can spin it a million other ways and make it their word against OP.

The courts have ruled that policy unconstitutional. This exact situation happened at the University of Iowa and the Christian group won a lawsuit in federal court. University administrators had to pay fines out of their own pockets.

> They guilted my friends who were members for drinking As a Lutheran, this is especially confusing to me. Beer is fairly central to our identities. "Is it before 11 am? Then drink coffee until it is time to drink beer."

Most of what you say is blatantly false and anyone in XA can confirm this. > Then after first semester they amped up talks with preachers condemning drinking and premarital sex, and pushed people to drop their non-christian friends No one is pushed to drop non-christian friends. The exact opposite is true. I've never seen drinking condemned and it's not uncommon to drink with your core group. Premarital sex is condemned. >They're so religious their events didn't even have mixed gender dancing. LOL. It's obvious you have never been to an XA event. > It's to trap drinking students at an event that they're too polite to leave Actually mug party is very easy to leave without being seen. Everyone is outside and anyone can leave whenever they please with no pressure. What do you think the welcome week concert and AFC events are for? Encouraging students not to go to block party.

yes!! UKirk is super new & super small but they are affirming :)

The courts have ruled that such CIO agreements are unconstitutional. This exact situation happened at the University of Iowa and the Christian group won a lawsuit in federal court.

If you go on Facebook, there's a community called Do Better Young Life. Maybe you could ask to post your story there if that's something that would be helpful for you.

I’m so sorry that happened to you. My friend used the “love the sinner, hate the sin” line once at church. It really opened my eyes to how some people who are friendly on the outside can be really exclusive and mean in their core beliefs. I’m nothing but proud of LGBTQ+ people who find ways to detox their experiences of fellowship and community.

Brown University rejects Trump administration compact, becoming the second institution to do so. UVA must follow the lead of MIT and Brown.

If everyone rejects it, they’ll fold. They’re looking for a vulnerability and UVA better not be it.

The curious thing about it is that the schools he chose to pick on are the best equipped to withstand the loss of federal funds. All have big endowments and donor bases they can tap into to temporarily fund themselves. Methinks none of those school intend to do it, they just gotta check with their brokers first.

It would be on brand if Brown College wrote its own declaration against the compact.

They sent me the old begging letter from the 1819 Society yesterday. If they want that cash they *better* reject the compact!

It’s not rude to call someone out for being a liar… and it’s really easy for everyone to know you’re one since there’s no “Edited” tag next to the time of posting.

There is no need to respond at all

I don’t disagree with the compact’s stated principles, I just wish it never came to this.

Didn’t you bitches fire your president at their request ? You’ll fold.

Endowments have been talked about a lot on UVA message boards - even more than not being able to use the general fund on athletics, most of it is specifically earmarked for one purpose or another. In other words, if someone gives a bunch of money to support WXTJ then the university can’t just say “hey sorry but it was an emergency and we needed your money for something else.”

That’s the point. If these fold, the admin assumes everyone else will. Look at Columbia.

What the heck is Brown College? I am ever True to Brown and I love my college dear

Yes we all secretly gathered as a university and cast our vote that’s exactly how this works.

Senate Dems are threatening to defund UVA if they fold, which may be giving them pause.

Maybe the UVA subreddit isn’t for you then.

https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/26/us/politics/university-of-virginia-president-trump.html That’s right. He “resigned” You’ll fold.

Got a link? I’d love to read about it.

They’re commenting because it’s Brown University, not “college”.

https://virginiamercury.com/2025/10/09/va-senate-dems-call-trump-admins-uva-funding-proposal-political-extortion/

"Brown College" in OP's statement is referring to a [Brown at UVA](https://browncollege.virginia.edu/), which is why it's not "Brown University", it's Brown College.

Lots of fluffy language. Did they ever explain why they forced their previous president to resign ? They said the school’s response will be “guided by the same principles of academic freedom and free inquiry that Thomas Jefferson placed at the center of the university’s mission more than 200 years ago, and to which the university has remained faithful ever since.”

Gotcha - I think they edited their comment because the original was less clear and had some typos. In its current form it makes more sense to be referring to Brown College

Democrats in the Virginia Senate didn’t force Ryan out.

Didn’t edit anything. Don’t be rude. You misread it. I’m now editing this comment and because I did, a nice “Edited” tag will show up. It’s not rude to call someone out for being a liar, you could have simply said “oops, my bad” or not said anything. But instead you fabricate a story at my expense to justify your downvotes.

UVA’s board not the politicians.

Not being rude there was definitely a typo earlier. You however ARE being rude.

University of Virginia President Under Pressure From Trump’s D.O.J. to Resign

This is authoritarian behavior. This has nothing to do with DEI, and everything to do with an administration that is working to crack down on and stifle higher education, academic freedom, and opposition.

They really need to tell them to F off.

Jim bleeds UVA and UVA bleeds Jim. He simply cannot go.

This is so sickening and unnecessary.

Virginia Tech and GMU alumni support the President of UVA! Stay strong!

This is weaponization of the government. Dangling litigation and potential prosecution if you don’t leave your job. Criminalizing dissent. We’re scanning the social media of visitors. Republicans are really making America more and more like China every day.

Stand your ground, UVA. This president is crumbling.

Don’t give them an inch. If you get rid of Ryan, and they’ll just move the goalposts and use the same threats to make you do something else they want.

President Ryan will prevail

UVA alumni, faculty, students, and staff can sign this Wahoos4UVA petition in support of President Ryan: https://www.wahoos4uva.com/take-action You can read more about Wahoos4UVA in this recent article in the Cavalier Daily: https://www.cavalierdaily.com/article/2025/06/resetuva-wahoos4uva-express-polar-views-on-university-leadership Here's the organization's official website, where you can read about their mission statement and advisory council members: https://www.wahoos4uva.com/

So some UVA law grads, emboldened by some cranky alumni who arrogantly believe they know what's good for everyone at a university they no longer attend and do not have to manage, are using their positions in the DOJ to extort UVA into letting Jim Ryan go. Their actions are dishonorable at best and grounds for misconduct at worst. UVA should sue the administration. Watch the cash flow in from alumni to support that.

Most important part of the article was the last few paragraphs: “The unusual targeting of a college president comes one month after Justice Department lawyers used their power to force student editors of The Harvard Law Review, a legal journal run independently of the university, to withdraw a letter of reprimand for a student who worked there. Following a similar strategy that Mr. Miller’s America First Legal group has tried against student-run legal journals at Northwestern and New York University, the Justice Department asserted that The Harvard Law Review was discriminating against white, male authors. The student who had been reprimanded, Daniel Wasserman, was accused of violating the Law Review’s privacy policy by downloading copies of thousands of internal documents. The Justice Department said that Mr. Wasserman was a cooperating witness in its investigation. Mr. Wasserman now works in the White House for Mr. Miller.” Quid pro quo… disgusting 🤢

Explains why the state house actually did something by not confirming Youngkin's BOV picks.

So much for Republicans being the party of less Goverment intrusion.

Hands off our education

He's coincidentally suing every pro-constitution judge in VA. Make no mistake, he's trying to turn our courts into his.

Do not resign.

I wonder who, the three anonymous sources are and how closely they are tied to the Jefferson Council. If so is this the Sa, e kind of back door coup attempt that failed with Sullivan?

I hope UVA stands up to Trump and tells him to go eat a bag of gonorrhea infected dicks. As a VaTech Alum, I stand with UVA. Fuck Trump!

What makes me upset is the lack of retribution if there is another Democratic Admin. Democrats should be forcing the Supreme Court to make a ruling. And in their brief, state explicitly what they would do to red states and conservative institutions, including the courts, if they don’t do their jobs and reign in this executive power. Play hardball.

Sounds like a great opportunity to RESIST!

As a Hokie, let me say this loudly and clearly to Trump and his cronies in the justice department, and to Youngkin if he doesn't tell them the same: GO FUCK YOURSELF Cville, Blacksburg stands with you.

Did his son apply and not get accepted or something? Just saying…

The fascism is no longer just creeping, it’s bounding.

I hate this. And then I remembered it hasn't even been six fucking months with this guy.

The implications for this ouster would be immense and devastating. The current BOV are all Republicans appointed by Youngkin, which means they would be in charge of hiring the new President - which would be a travesty for our community and the future of UVA. This is a personal vendetta and/or an attempt to keep the knee on liberal necks (liberalism: a political and social philosophy that promotes individual rights, civil [liberties](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&sca_esv=000223f181a12c46&q=liberties&si=AMgyJEuX8sCQ2kc8L1tnlWVo3ksQGnrm83JmFwV16CYnbnkH3Ua5aadDXXp3iClPE07TOjV1jMwkPIr7PfScYLFHJvIHJnLU8NyUON6XkVk7zxvqNIMO5I8%3D&expnd=1&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiY9tqa25GOAxXANlkFHUR5BScQyecJegQIOxBb), democracy, and free enterprise) - and has nothing to do with DEI. We must stand with Pres. Ryan.

ONLY HOKIES CAN F WITH UVA GET THE FEDS OFF OUR TERF HOKIES STAND WITH U UVA

Hold the line. And fuck fascists. And also racist UVA alumni. <3 Mr. Miller, and anyone else hell-bent on dismantling DEI, sounds like he’s desperately searching for a struggle. It must be so exhausting carrying the burden of defending the most protected group in the country: white men. He might want to worry less about imaginary oppression and more about ending up on the wrong side of history by fueling racial inequality. There are much bigger fish to fry rn (like defending our democracy, liberty, actual equality, and justice).

MAGA is a disease.

I believe there is a protest planned for today at 3PM at the Rotunda. Wear orange and white is what I heard.

DoJ and Jefferson Council colluding. Arghhh!

Such ridiculous hypocrisy from the government. Pushing its beliefs on universities across America while accusing the University President of pushing his beliefs on the university. If you are confused, the university hired the University president not the current racist federal governmen5.

Attacking education. What box haven’t they checked?✅

Fuck trump.

Tell trumps Department of Jerkoffs to pound sand!

These cranky old UVA grads should spend their money on NIL deals instead if they want to influence their alma mater.

And why do we give a shit what Donald’s doj emasculated stooges are trying to do?

Sorry, kiddos, no more Run With Jim! Daddy Trump is vewy mads at the president of a public state university.

I’m irate that we caved and I’ve never hated a group of people more in my life than this administration. A plague on all their houses.

literally the only people who want him out are old white alums, recent alums and current students love him

I believe this guy is responsible: [His Place in Time | Give to UVA](https://giving.virginia.edu/stories/his-place-in-time)

It's too late. A sad day for the University. Ryan made UVA both great and good...he will be missed.

What did he even do? I read the story, and there were no details at all about what the Trump admin was upset about, other than "secret" DEI programs or something. Does anyone know what this is actually about? Jim Ryan is a great man.

Stand up to the authoritarian regime UVA. Lead the way!

This is about Title IX discrimination. Play stupid games win stupid prizes

This had everything to do with weakling governor youngkin. He needs to be ousted immediately

Has a direct giving link been established to support DEI via the UVA giving site?

Ready for winter break

Hoos completely adorable???

Lovely smiley baby

Those paws lead me to believe that’s gonna be a huge pupper. A huge, classy, awesome pupper.

That’s good ole song of wah-hoo-wah, we’ll sing it o’er and o’re ..

SO CUTE holy shit this made up for how shitty today was

Please boop the snoot for me

Be ware coming to steel this cutems to avenge them stealing my heart :)

I spent three nights capturing the Heart and Soul Nebulae over the Rotunda

wow. edit: now that the initial beauty of this image has passed I can’t get over the idea of some first years going to streak the lawn at 2am to find a dude with a telescope and massive camera hahahaha (i know the article says july let me have fun)

For more information on this photo check out: https://news.virginia.edu/content/alumnus-captures-photo-rotunda-you-have-see-believe

Gorgeous work!

Your work paid off nicely

Awesome. Thanks for sharing.

Very cool! I read the article in the UVA update email they send out, the pic they posted there was too big to see it all on my screen, so now I can better appreciate it.

This is unreal holy heck

This is amazing brother man! What’s your setup?

Bravo! You can also go to McCormick observatory for better views

Would you mind saying a bit more about the construction of this image? Id assume the rotunda and the background are shot separately, but i’d love to know some more detail as to how you went about that, and the algorithms you used to stitch the various photos together.

Shot the sky with a ZWO ASI2600MC cooled astro camera and the land with a SonyA7rIII. Askar FMA180 lens for both.

For the images of the sky, I use an equatorial mount which has finally tuned gears to track stars as the earth rotates, keeping them precisely in frame and countering the earth’s rotation. I set up this mount and using Polaris, align it precisely with the earth’s polar alignment. I then find a star in the field of view, and using a separate small camera attached to the main optical train track that star using a guiding program that will send commands to the mount to keep it centered during a long exposure. Usually I can keep my error margin less than 1 pixel over a ten minute exposure. I will then take many photos of the same section of the sky — 30 two minute exposures in the case of this photo, and then integrate them — stacking for noise reduction (ie with each successive image we have a better idea of what lightness value each pixel represents so less noise). Once I have these light frames, I will calibrate them with dark frames at the same exposure time and temperature to correct for hot pixels/noise and flat frames (a uniform light field) to correct for optical aberrations (dust motes, vignetting). For this photo I did that four times for each panel and then stitched them together in a mosaic that is astronomically accurate (ie it can be plate solved against star databases). The processing program I use is a dedicated astrophotography program called PixInsight. For the ground I used the same lens and a SonyA7rIII mirrorless camera, shooting landscape (the sky panels were in portrait orientation). I shot three panels to get the entire Rotunda, trees, and sky section and then constructed a mosaic of the ground in Photoshop. I merged the two together ensuring that the arc/second per pixel measurement was accurate for both (ie that the proportion of the nebula to the rotunda was correct for that focal length and distance).

Wow - I came here to ask the above question less eloquently! It looks so cool. You should hope sell it as a poster - sure that set up is not cheap

Ms Kathy's portrait just revealed in Newcomb

She deserves the best

I hope Ms. Kathy gets paid a salary proportionate to the joy she brings to the University

as she should

Is this permanent or in their gallery?

Ms Kathy is a shining star

Oh that’s wonderful!

This woman is a national freaking treasure

Is it true she was laid off? See go fund me page. Was she rehired? https://www.gofundme.com/f/supporting-our-beloved-ms-kathy

This is awesome

its what she deserves- MS KATHY SUPREMACY

As an alumnus, I’d actually donate money to that cause.

No way the university could afford that

To my knowledge, permanent. It's located at the top of the grand staircase

That's from 2020, when classes moved online due to the pandemic and the dorms cleared out. UVA never really shut down, but most students left and I think those left got takeaway meals at OHill. This article from March 2020 gives you a snapshot of what it was like: [https://www.nbc29.com/2020/03/12/university-virginia-student-stuck-charlottesville-preps-life-dorms/](https://www.nbc29.com/2020/03/12/university-virginia-student-stuck-charlottesville-preps-life-dorms/) Here's a WUVA "Day in the Lift" video from a student who stayed in housing during that time: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB2WSlDW3WY

Ive seen her at least once a week working in newcomb. Granted, I currently work two days remotely, but she is definitely still there.

Hope she got the gofundme money ❤️

Regardless of political opinion, today's events should make you mad I want to start by saying I did not attend the protest. I don't have a strong opinion on the content of the protest right now. I do have a strong opinion about the university changing policies at will with total ignorance of the process. I'm sure that most students have been at the receiving end of the "it's policy, nothing we can do" line that comes from many administrators. There was no announcement that the policy was being changed. They just slyly swapped out the documents whenever they wanted. The number of times I have heard, "Oh, well, that information is online," is astonishing. This is totally unacceptable behavior from an academic institution and a severe violation of trust. "**Oh, but they can do whatever they want. It's their school."** I'm not saying that I can't; I'm saying that I don't want it to be that way. I don't care if the school controls its policies and ignores any process. What I care about is being told that the policy is gospel and nothing can be done when that is clearly not the case. Someone can snap their fingers and solve pretty much any problem. The school can effectively gaslight anyone they want by having someone change a PDF somewhere and pretend that that's that. **What I want:** To be clear, I do not care that the school controls the policy. I care that they pretend they don't when it comes to situations where policy significantly impacts someone's life. With that in mind, the student body has a vested interest in demanding the following: 1. Getting an official statement regarding how policy changes are made and approved that accurately reflects how exactly the tent provisions were changed this morning 2. A statement regarding whether or not that policy is going to be enforced by the school 3. A statement outlining what responsibility the school has in communicating policy changes to the student body 4. An internal and public review of the events that led to the changing of the policy assessing whether the school's policies were violated, and a plan of accountability for involved parties Rules are not a convenience. They are a necessity. UVA's policies are not some plaything that can be flaunted to the student body at will while simultaneously being some impenetrable rule of law. All I want is consistency and accountability for where I will spend a significant portion of my life. Edit: Since this is getting some visibility I want to reiterate: I do not care what the policy actually is, I care that at 9AM the PDF that held the policy said one thing, and two hours later it said another. Changing that in such a secret way is *insane* behavior. How on earth are we supposed to trust official school regulations if they can just change like that? It could even be the case that the protestors were aware of what was required of them directly from administration and the PDF changing was just a followup on a previously made decision. I do not care. If the school is going to use their online resources as a source of truth, then there needs to be clarity on how it operates. The last thing I need in my life is to be gaslit on regulation if for some reason a policy regarding my degree changes.

I believe Channel 29 just issued an official statement, but…. The “changed” document was on the EHS site, which is unofficial and unmonitored by the UVA administration. The official UVA Policy site has the policy document without the italics, showing that that it hasn’t been updated since 1/13/2023. This change, and the lack of earlier ones, are backed up by the archives. I got my information from someone in UVA IT who dug into this, but there is an earlier thread on this specific subject that has some relevant links.

I agree with the sentiment and most of the content, but it’s publicly funded and the state has some say in policy. I have no idea at all if that played a part in today’s response, but just wanted to call that out. I am 100% in support of peaceful protests. Even if tents were against policy, that’s not a tear gas situation.

Tbh, I think trying to get huge orgs to change their investment strategies by camping is dumb af, but I’m totally against what they did in this case with changing the policy ad hoc, and I also think it’s incredible that they didn’t think anyone had read and/or made a copy of prior policy nor that this generation of students wouldn’t notice. It’s hilarious. Also, anyone who wants to go down the rabbit hole on this should 100% FOIA requests any phone and/or email records between Ryan and Youngkin over the past 14 days or so. I’d bet there’s something interesting there.

Non-violent protests are AMERICAN AS FUCK and holy shit its so disappointing to see policy members everywhere forget this.

Did Jim Ryan ever go speak to the protesting students directly? I honestly do not know the answer to this, but I can't help feeling it could've diffused everything, if he did. He seems to have a decent rapport with the student body. I see articles about him going on runs with them. If there was ever a time for him to engage with members of the student body it should have been before he allowed violence against them. Does anyone know the answer to this question? Did he go speak to them directly at the protest site?

Question—not an argument against you—can anyone point to any information indicating that the rule which was purportedly changed at 9:54AM today was being used as a justification to clear out protestors? The way I see it, based on how the rule was written, if authorities said at any point something to the effect of “these tents have not been inspected and therefore cannot stand,” then the argument that the rule was changed to help justify dismantling the encampment is sound. And in that case, the policy change is a super heavy handed and frankly stupid move by the university. How did they not realize people would pick up on that? However, if not, then I think the fervor around the policy change is pretty misguided. It’s entirely possible that that provision was removed to reduce confusion (i.e. so that future demonstrators do not think a rule in a health and safety regulation gives them free range to erect and occupy tents in publicly used areas for an undetermined and/or undisclosed period of time). In that case, it’s also pretty obvious that the university considers itself within its rights to disperse demonstrators on grounds for any reason. At that point you have a different challenge altogether, pertaining to the first amendment rather than this policy change. In either case I 100% agree that transparency is absolutely necessary, especially with the recent news that the school won’t be releasing their report on the November 2022 shooter. They cannot be let off the hook without scrutiny

Transparency is key.

Regardless of what the policy is, when carrying out policy, you always have to look at proportionality. What would you think if you got pulled over for speeding and a police officer came up to you and screamed at you to put your hands in the air. The protestors were not violent, and the only violence that took place were from the police officers themselves. They could’ve sent someone to negotiate with the protestors, instead they chose the most extreme option. Sure they can do it technically and legally, but morally, is it the right thing to do. Unequivocally, it is not.

University Police Chief Longo said [on April 30 that tents were not allowed](https://x.com/nathan_onibudo/status/1785442461961064569?s=46&t=4mCcE8B2WO-yz0idHO1oTQ). The Daily Progress [reported yesterday](https://dailyprogress.com/news/local/education/tents-go-up-at-uva-protest/article_9ffdc1c4-09b9-11ef-8eb6-b791db6be31f.html) that tents were against policy.

Students need to realize they are the CUSTOMER of a PRODUCT. I pay you for a product. I am the customer. My voice matters and you can’t change terms and conditions after a purchase! The uni is a “manufacturer” and are liable / responsible. You can absolutely seek a refund if the product was worsened. Just a thought. For the DMs I’ve received: I took this approach with one of my schools and the changed policy as a result. Just saying.

When you hit the real world you'll have these same beefs with it. You should remain feeling the same way, you are correct these things are not fair, they are "just what it is" - and that doesn't make it okay, nor worth living by knowing change is possible. But you won't feel that way in the real world, they'll add enough stacking pressures where the unfairness, and the sheer scope of effort required to change even miniscule things that are patently absurd to everyone - yet all anyone wants is for you to STFU and stop whining - just accept that unfair and lazy are how life is gonna be till you die. Prove me wrong and we got a chance as a species. I suspect getting worked up on a college policy is gonna leave you spent from not changing anything on a small scale, and getting the dose of reality that everyone agrees with you, but ain't upset enough to bother to fix a damn thing.

The “last minute policy change” was a fake. The official UVA policy site and the archives show that the last change to the tent policy was on 1/13/23. This has been discussed elsewhere.

It doesn’t matter that they “changed” (clarified) the policy, police warned them multiple times what would happen if they didn’t clear the encampment. It wasn’t “secretive.” Protestors were told what was coming and they decided to not take the university seriously. Also, you’re lying to yourself if you think letting people tent next to a historical landmark and the centerpiece of the university is good policy making.

The protest is about little children getting blown into bloody chunks. Stick with that, I'm not going to get mad about tents.

As a new student just finishing my first semester, I'm honestly embarrassed.

I am not seeing it, can anyone share explicitly what was the policy before and what it was changed to?

“What I want” is the problem with your generation Nobody gives a flying fuck what you want Don’t like the policy leave the school Don’t like the country, buy a plane ticket (you won’t) The generation before yours protested and complained about every other issue during their college years Now they are finding out that they can’t afford a one bedroom apartment with their degree & they effected NOTHING socially except for annoying everyone You go to college to learn & prepare for whatever career you’re into …. Not to “virtue signal” save the world

Please email this to President Jim Ryan, Provost Ian Baucom, and Timothy Longo!

this post has finally clarified what a “True Neutral” alignment would feel like to encounter

The people who had tents were told to take them down. When they learned the tents were against policy, they took them down. Then, they decided to put them back up. The broader community wasn’t notified, but those who needed to know, were notified. They made a decision to keep the tents up. I understand the OP doesn’t care about the specific policy. Insert “violated the policy “ for “put up tents “. They made a decision. That decision was intended to be provocative, and it was. The university reminded them of the policy and gave them overnight to get right. If they took down the tents they could still be there.

Whoa second line…. You don’t have an opinion on killing kids and civilians?

You all should be very angry with your school. As the parent of an aspiring UVA student, I was very pleased to see that the encampment situation at seemed relatively drama-free and peaceful. For a University to call in police to pepper spray their own students is awful. I’m not saying that there could never be a situation that would merit it, but if the school had to change their policies just to have an excuse to call in riot police, it sounds like this was not one of them.

What is this about? I just came across this on my feed? Idk about anything man, the main thing in my news is UFC/WWE/Boxing results from last night and the Drake/Kendrick beef. Literally real life news has escaped me for a couple weeks

Does a business (with consumers/students) have the right to change policies at any time without notice? I mean I usually get an email when Netflix changes its terms.

Well I didn’t read it all but the university is only out to make money so they will either side with one of the two factions because it loses them less money. The only exception to that is not betraying the teaching they have had for the last decade of saying America bad.i don’t seen them having that strong of a conviction or loyalty to the ideals so it’s about money.

Those who make the policy are not subject to it, by and large. It may not be fair, but it's the way it works.

Police presence always deescalate things🤔. I'm not sure if they started getting destructive before or after the cops showed up but, my real question is why are they not protesting something that actually affects them such as student loan debt, inflation or rent prices?

Inspector Javert was very satisfied with the response. Riot gear, pepper spray (at least one you woman straight in the eyes) is disproportionate. Looks like civil rights protests of the 60s- same kind of cops. I do not care about if policy was changed or not. They students WERE nonviolent and were willing to be arrested (like anti war protestors currently are all the time in DC). But the police response was abusive and authoritarian (and oddly stronger than the torch brigade of outsiders who DID threaten students ). For context, as a UVa student in the 80s, there were shanties on the lawn protesting Apartheid. There was a lot of discussion about them but no police response like this…but that was largely before every police forces was not over militarized back then. Adults and politicians and administrators in this country need to take a long hard look at how they handle youth dissent (violently). It strikes me as authoritarian at best at fascist at worst. Be prepared for the scorn of an entire generation of educated students. Nothing was learned from BLM and certainly nothing has changed. I’m disgusted.

The people that they're protesting for kill lgbtq people and treat women like crap. By the way I don't care about Israel I'm not for them I'm just saying

I dont go to uva this came on my feed can someone elaborate?

Bunch of bitches.

Arrest every one of those terrorist loving traitors.

Yeah my point is don't go defending Hitler's Allies and saying they were right for trying to exterminate the jews. It's 2024 can't believe I have to say this.

I don’t know what you’re referring to and reading the first half of your long post didn’t give me any insight either.

That’s a lot of words for not having an opinion.

I’ve lived in Charlottesville since November 2000. UVa has made a lot of things go away. They will do the same with this. Question is will uva students let it go away?

Policy is gospel. There’s policy everywhere in the real world and this is an excellent opportunity for these kids to understand that. It’s not gaslighting if their job is to protect the student population by preserving an environment that fosters safety and education. Crafting policies/rules tailored to whatever challenge is at hand is part of that job.

Demand… ?. Really…are young people that snowflake….Huh? Where do you think you can demand anything? Are you that entitled? I want baked beans for free from Kroger.. they have investments in companies all over the world… why aren’t people setting up tents at Kroger… Walmart? McDonald’s in Israel… Target… You pay to come to get an education… it’s a transaction… you broke their rules… it’s a Virginia state school… they called the Virginia state police… I’m not mad I’m glad that some leaders just shut this off.

State gonna state. 😂

It’s not like Virginia has a proud history of protest and resistance to the status quo, constitutional law, or prevailing liberal norms.

All of these schools will drop a student as soon as anything is wrong with them. This whole country is a disgusting bunch of pigs telling us what to do and I think it’s time for it to stop. Forget about working for this stupid machine. Do not go to college. Work a simple job. Take back the Earth.

If UVa changed the rules during the middle of the game then UVa caused any civil unrest.

Sometimes, you plan for one thing and realize something else might be better. Unfortunately, these types of things can happen when things get out of hand. Regardless of your opinion on the matter, the reality is that protests have become aggressive and borderline out of control. I'd argue most universities have failed in this matter. Look at the chaos at Columbia University.

Schools are fascist like organizations that operate under the illusion that they are forward thinking. There was a path of protecting the rights of these young adults while keeping it civil and protective of everyone's education and safety.

When my son and his friends couldn’t leave the library after six hours of studying due to these protesters who screamed anti-Israel and anti-Semitic filth at them earlier, it was as time to break up the protest. It is insane that the protestors think that is appropriate behavior to hurl at students during exams. In 2017 this antisemitism came from the far right, now it comes from the far left.

Well, if the university has “ total ignorance of the process “, what can you expect?

People can protest peacefully People cannot setup encampments and get violent Colleges aren’t daycare centers Enjoy the tears

I'm honestly kinda bugging out over the fact that the heinous shit they did at IU just last week they literally did exactly to you all, but worse. After everything that students, grads, faculty, community did in reaction. I'm so fuckin' sorry that this happened to y'all. Stand tall, take care of eachother. You're stronger than them.

"From the river to the sea" does not mean a single, multi national, democratic state. It means the eradication of the state of Israel. You might be in favor of this happy lala land, but Hamas, Iran, Syria, Hezbolah, etc are not.

Three stars shone the brightest last night during the vigil 🧡💙

Looks like a beautiful night, fly high angels 👼🏽 🙏🏽

you mean less light pollution for a brief period. you, as a human would never be able to see a star get brighter without a time lapse and some expensive gear.

Current UVa protest mood: In tents

I just got an alert about police activity in the Rotunda/Chapel area. Is this related?

For the record, UVA's Health & Safety Tent Regulations explicitly exempt "recreational tents for camping" from needing inspection/a permit... [or at least they did until 9:54am today, when the administration silently edited the PDF of the rules.](https://twitter.com/PEHJackson/status/1786776682386313621)

Looks peaceful, which contrary to popular opinion is allowed

Just looking at it from this picture, it actually looks like a family-friendly tailgate.

This has included not using megaphones and not erecting tents.* *....*I*n a caption, organizers called UVa’s response “shameful” and wrote that they would “not debate nor negotiate genocide.”* *“We will not back down. We will stay until the University meets our demands!!” they wrote.* *Hours later, as the sun began to set over Grounds, protesters pitched their tents.* *That move is a direct violation of university policy, policy which protesters had obeyed until Friday evening. For days, tents had laid flat on the ground, unassembled but ready to be pitched at a moment’s notice. The decision to erect the tents comes as rain is expected over the next week.*

This will be a true test of UVA’s proclaimed “freedom of speech.” They claim to be one of the schools that will protect that right no matter what as a testament to Thomas Jefferson’s ideals of individual liberties. Looks like the protesters are peaceful and enacting tents but i’m wondering if this will go differently than Columbia/UCLA/Texas

While I disagree with their ideas, as long as it is peaceful and law-abiding, they should not receive any problems.

Is this the source of the police activity alert that just came out? Will we never learn not to arrest our own students?

Wish I had that much time on my hands

Ah the contrast to the white supremacist march where not a cop was to be found

Please, just keep it peaceful.

the “Liberated Zone” shit will never not be cringe

Do people realize that “divestment” means the shares that get sold are just purchased by somebody else? What impact exactly will that have on anybody actually directly affected in the conflict? This has zero impact on the financials or funds of the companies being traded for one... If anything, it would give Pro-War lobbying shareholders more shares to purchase up and more voting power in the companies. What exactly does this accomplish? I’m genuinely at a loss as to what the end goal is.

To be honest I don't think it will be on the News or turn into something big, like those in UCLA, Columbia, UT Austin, USC and U-Minnisota. After all, Charlottesville is just a small place.....

Honest question…what does setting up tents and protesting a war that’s not even happening in our country in a place 6k miles away, that I presume 99% of the people never been to do?

Wow, from Wednesday to Friday I don't see any tents, only a few people who have sheets on the grass, when did they set up the tents?

In tent city

Man my Mama has to work overtime for this.

What’s going on here?

Aren't we still supporting war for Ukraine tho? I'm confused...

Arrest them all

Not a fact. If they want the Palestinians wiped out, it would have been done by now. On the other hand, Hamas and the Palestinian authority and Iran actually have it in their charters, written into the public record and on the books that they won’t stop until Israel has been eradicated. I don’t know where you and the other numb nuts get your info but it’s a false narrative and you have bought into a lie, hook line and sinker. You really need to read up on history before your start spreading lies.

Let’s not forget what happened in October 7. Hamas wants to kill every single Jew on earth. That’s what they live for. Do you remember the Munich Olympics (of course you don’t) do you remember the Islamic revolution, did you know its in Iran’s legal code to kill every last Jew in the world and eradicate Israel, did you know that Israel didn’t ask Arabs or Palestinians to leave n 1947 but instead invited them to stay only to be attacked by them, did you know that the 7 day war was started by the Arab nations, did you know that Egypt and Jordan have peace treaties with Israel. Did you know that October 7th was Hamas’ and Iran’s effort to undermine the Saudi peace treaty? It’s awful that the situation is what the situation is? Why aren’t people protesting what’s happening in Somalia or Ethiopia. Myopia runs deep. Learn the facts. Learn history and learn current events.

They don't need to study anymore? Just protest?

Free Palestine from the barbaric Zionists.

Anything to get out of going to class 🙄

Let it rain! Hope yall brought your rain coats😂

Moronic protest by morons. Sure it will do alot of good. For their insta's. Smh

Where are the protests for the following? 617,910 as of March 2024 in Syria. More than 150,000 people have been killed in Yemen as well as estimates of more than 227,000 dead as a result of an ongoing famine and lack of healthcare facilities due to the war Ethnic killings in one Sudan city left up to 15,000 dead. 5,000 deaths in the Iranian month of Aban, which corresponds with days the regime intensified its crackdown on nationwide protests. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine resulted in at least 82,000 deaths in 2022, Ethiopia — over 104,000 — in that conflict between the national government and regional forces in Tigray

Why is it only Iran and it’s proxies are supporting the Palestinians? Ask yourself that…why are the Egyptian, Jordanian, Saudi Arabian, Emeratii, and others in the region not supporting the Palestinian?

UVA Alert. Police activity at chapel rotunda area. Looks like the encampment won't be here much longer. Bye bye Felicia.

Turned into a real shit show

They know Hummas will jail all LGBTQ+, right? Or stone them.

So next move is on uva. They are violating policy. Make them move

Let's all chip in to send them to Gaza to fight for them

Imagine simping for terrorists

These ppl are LOSERS.

For someone who isn't in tune with the current thing, what is being protested?

Is fucking allowed at this encampment??

Who raised these kids?

Well, future leaders of the civilized world, sitting in tents and posting on social media is bound to solve a situation that more than 2,000 years of direct involvement hasn't. That will show everyone you are, indeed, protesting something. Unfortunately, it is something you don't understand, as your actions betray. Good luck with that.......

Intensity in tent cities

I wanted to add the homeless problem could be solved this way. Pitch a tent on university grounds on The premise that you are HELPING solve a Global crisis.

Intensity in tent city.

What is this protest even about? First time hearing about it

Judge bars Youngkin’s University appts. https://www.cbs19news.com/news/fairfax-county-judge-rules-to-block-youngkin-appointments/article_7db4d20e-8c78-4b83-8acb-863de07ee565.html A judge ordered that eight public university board members tapped by Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin be removed from their posts in a victory for Virginia Senate Democrats who rejected the appointees in a June committee vote.

"And, that “\[n\]o person appointed to any office by the Governor, whose appointment is subject to confirmation by the General Assembly, under the provisions of this Constitution or any statute, shall enter upon, or continue in, office after the General Assembly shall have refused to confirm his appointment.”" This is literally what Virginia's constitution says lol Youngkin tried to skip having the General Assembly confirm the appointees, and the "spokesperson" for the AG, Jason Miyares, tried to argue as if this is in their favor through what I can only describe as gaslighting "'This case is straightforward,' Kenney said in a statement. 'The Constitution is clear that it is the General Assembly, not a fraction of a Senate Committee, that is authorized to act.'" Imagine putting on a smile and spouting such obvious bullshit that is a direct attempt to override the people of Virginia's rights and representation. Definitely suggest everyone read, this is a very interesting situation that they laid out well. A very valuable win for Virginia.

No pay wall, very complete story from Cardinal News. https://cardinalnews.org/2025/07/29/fairfax-court-bars-youngkins-boards-of-visitors-appointees-from-serving-miyares-will-appeal-preliminary-injunction/

Good. The state’s position makes little sense.

Glad we have UVA alums that care about the success of this school.

I think even if another judge undoes this, without confirmation, the next governor could simply remove them in January. Realistically, their presence on the board won’t change anything between now and then anyhow, as the rest of the board are Younkin appointees anyway.

Good riddance

Since the BOV continued to include the Cooch after his nomination was rejected by the Senate committee, wouldn’t this constitute “malfeasance”? Could a potential Gov. Spanberger legally have these members removed? Or would AG Miyares’ support (though an unlawful violation) of the Cooch’s BOV membership provide legal cover for them? GOP breaking the law and authoritarian executive workaround of legislative bodies seems to be the new unconstitutional norm.

This is great! And also didn’t realize we still have Yahoo news?? 😂

Impacts whether Board of Visitors can lawfully meet and make decisions.

It’s as if this case has nothing to do with those things, but go on.

Are the liberals in the room with you right now?

Does it? There are active BOV members appointed by Younkin that were already confirmed by the general assembly in the past couple of years. Even without the group that was invalidated by the court decision, I believe the confirmed members still make up a majority of the total seats.

True true, only joking! Thanks for sharing.

Yes, if the non-confirmed members participate in meetings, there are issues regarding the voting, taking actions. Also, there are concerns that even holding a meeting could create legal jeopardy for the BOV.

Some protest pictures. I usually don't share, but some of these were pretty cool

I have made the pictures available on Instagram, with some extras included: [link here](https://www.instagram.com/p/C6oeMN7M-SF/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==) I understand this is a sensitive topic and people may have strong feelings about it. From what I observed, the vast majority of protestors were peaceful and exercising their legal rights. Only a small number engaged in throwing objects at the police, and only after they had begun pushing them out of the camp. There were many legal observers present documenting the event, so if anything unlawful occurred from either side, I trust it was captured and will be addressed through proper channels. Seeing riot police steamroll other UVA students was not something I enjoyed. I had concerns about a couple specific officers - one who kept placing his hand on his firearm and another carrying a large pepper spray canister. But overall, I did not observe the police engaging in clear misconduct, and arrests were minimal. I would not characterize either party as having acted seriously out of order. My aim in posting was to document the events at the chapel. I respect that there are a lot of perspectives at play here, and I am giving mine as an observer. Please also realize that I am posting pictures of law enforcement with my name attached to it and that carries risks with it.

I'm remembering Kent State and it's awful. The sight of soldiers with loaded rifles on a college campus where books and learning are the weapon is truly haunting and the sense of dread I get Is palpable.

You took better images than any news outlet. Fantastic!

We are so over-militarized as a society. Why the fuck is it acceptable to have automatic weapons in the hands of people on the frontlines of these things? The next Kent State is inevitable if they bring the weapons.

These police are decked out like they are deploying to Fallujah. Is this necessary, or even helpful? How do law enforcement officers in other countries dare to leave their stations without gear like that?

State police shouldn’t be allowed to cover their faces, wear clear visors/goggles. They’re public officers. Covid isnt an excuse anymore.

Not commenting on the subject of the protest or the protest itself but as a service member I must say this trend of “tacticool” police is really annoying and dangerous.

Does anyone know who took the pics? It’s hard to tell

Chilling to see heavily armed cops, sometimes even pointing their weapons at students, when we've so recently lost classmates to gun violence. Shame on UVA.

Absolutely disgusting display. I don't know when our society will get police back under control--probably never since so many authoritarian lovers seem to like this sort of thing-- but the militarization of police and the sheer over the top, bullying response that cops so often employ should be criminal.

People complaining about the police turnout yet if they weren’t there and shit popped off they would complain about the police not responding fast enough. I seem to remember something like that happening in Charlottesville a few years back. Couldn’t pay me enough to be a cop. Anyway, Op, amazing photojournalism. I wish you the best, stay safe out there. Keep doing what you are doing. Hard to beat frontline accounts.

do you have these on instagram anywhere?

Any protestors here - Why do the pro Palestine protestors all wear masks? Is it to hide identity in case of arrests?

Sic semper tyrannis indeed. The irony of the troopers wearing that patch while standing with assault rifles over student protesters is too much.

This level of militarization is pretty grotesque. Especially as protests at UVA had been non existent

Yall should go do like a citizens academy or something and actually learn about what police do before commenting on it. So many uninformed people in this thread

Police should never dress like soldiers

Great photos, terrible comment section.

Last guy looks like Ben shapiro

Take photos at UMICH it was insane during finals week

Can’t lie guy in the 3rd photo looks adorable

Amazing Pictures

Children calling for genocide

u/HiImSteveS do you mind if I share these on other platforms and give you credit for the photos? You did a fantastic job capturing the militarized response to tents and feel this should be shared. thx!

Thanks for letting us know these are "copywritten." LOL

Good quality photos. It’s important to look closely at the people involved because today it’s so easy to see the group as a single entity, as opposed to many individuals with their own experiences and emotions. That goes for the protestors, and those in uniform.

why the AR and shit like they going into a hostile zone. It just always seems so fake.

Heck ur watermark

First pic goes hard

Cops in full riot gear at a school protest that never had intention to be violent is so dumb. Dudes so excited to shoot students but will let a mass shooter go wild.

I don't even go to this school and these photos are just upsetting, shocking, and chilling to see. This better not happen at my school....which seems unlikely anyway given students there can't afford to ditch classes to protest or risk their futures getting expelled

Arrest, expel and deport.

This fucking country bro 😂😂😂

This fucking country bro 😂😂😂

Where was this energy for torches

Protesting the best combatant to civilian modern urban warfare casualty rates and calling it a genocide is wild. This conflict has about a 1:1 ratio. Lot of major ones have been as high as 1:6 in recent wars.

virginia's supposed to be our rival but go virginia!!

People are blaming the university using police and said only small portion was not peaceful. I understand why UVA is treating this seriously as they already saw what other universities were going through. Things escalate fast.

“Police” armed to the teeth at a political protest while wearing “sic semper tyrannis” patches is peak irony.

Yay way for their problem to become ours. Especially since Palestine started this..."no we didn't hamas did" but when they started it you guys were in the streets yelling kill the Jews. And you let hamas speak for you at the peace talks. I remember for days the leader of the Jews kept saying "quit or we are going to defend ourselves” while you were taking child Jews hostage in the streets killing them on internet took out a village at nite killing all babies to old men. Crazy how you forget what u guys were doing to start this whole thing. Now it's poor us were the victim. WAR is WRONG MURDER IS WRONG

They should have been in DC on January 6th.

God bless these kids and their bravery, I am so proud of them for doing the right thing.

Just end it and cease fire. Our youth sre standing because it's wrong.

Hokie here. I am so sorry about what happened at UVA. VT's protest involved mostly VT police with assistance from other agencies in transporting those arrested. The PD didn't have riot shields, didn't cover their faces, didn't deploy tear gas. This sounds like an administration scared shitless who reacted poorly. To the photographer - amazing photos. You really showcased the overreaction of the university.

Pathetic ass police forces in this country trying to shut down free speech and protest against genocide and war crimes and egregious theft of tax dollars. We deserve so much better.

People wondering why the police are heavily armored but forget that the protesters are cosplaying as Hamas terrorists and glorifying terrorism.

I visited UVA few years ago, it’s located next to a nice little town.

You got some dope pics of my buddy lol

University of Virginia board votes to close DEI office

After seeing what happened to Columbia, I fully expect most colleges will do the same so they won't go financially insolvent.

Just a reminder: Disability accommodations are DEI. Title IX is DEI. Veteran accommodations are DEI. Accommodations for students that are parents or caregivers are DEI. DEI has become a hot term for people to throw at others when they think that person doesn’t deserve to be where they are in life, but it truly is about making society fair and equitable and inclusive.

no backbone. we deserve better

BOV never liked non-whites all that much anyways.

They want me dead. And I work for them. Fuck this shit man. This feeling sucks so bad. I’m usually a self assured guy

As an old alum I find this very disturbing, rolling over for the bullies is never the answer

This is so disappointing. I grieve this choice.

This is extremely disheartening to hear as an alumni. I will be withholding donations and I hope my fellow alumni will do the same.

Cowardice and evil from the Youngkin appointees and bigots at the Jefferson Council. A bad decision that will actively harm the university, because these people think that every change made after 1950 and 1969 needs to be reversed. "Good and Great" my ass.

This country is done for. What a fucking nightmare.

What some of these universities don’t understand is that bending the knee by eliminating DEI programs is not going to get Trump off their necks. He will still come after educational institutions because he wants an uneducated populace that will vote for what we wants.

What an incredible crock.

Disgraceful

Does this mean that SDAC will close aswell???

Most MAGA folks don’t even have GED to make it to UVA.

Can anyone say what will actually be lost?

Appeasement is actually smart and anyone who disagrees just doesn’t understand the reality of the situation /s

You don’t need a DEI office to diversify admissions or hiring. It’s a question of how you evaluate applicants. There is no reason businesses and institutions cannot take into account a persons life experiences in getting to where they are. As someone who hired accounting staff, the person from a less prestigious school who had to work their way through school often made for the better employee.

WAPO has already died in darkness

It’s remarkable that so many people in this thread love racial discrimination so much that they are furious that the Board wouldn’t risk its federal funding to try to keep a particularly gross public form of it. Who knew George Wallace’s intellectual descendants would end up at UVA.

All,athletes,that disagree transfer. Hell you got into uva. You can go anywhere. Transfer.

I’m so upset and ashamed by this. Sadly not surprised with all the youngkin appointees. Pure cowardice on UVAs end. Values only count when it’s hard. At what point will they finally balk? I guess we’ll find out. One domino at a time.

Ashamed of my Alma mater.

Great news!

Honestly I find a lot of shit pushed in the name of DEI backwards and unproductive, but this is just pure cowardice.

As a liberal - good

VT needs to do it next

Fuqqing cowards

Does anyone here know what "DEI" means? The "E for equity" stands for equal outcomes, not equal opportunity. And Title IX is part of a federal civil rights law, stands on its own and doesn't need DEI policies. DEI is not a law, but a woke policy that became popular in certain parts of the population, particularly academia, circa 2020. And DEI has nothing to do with disabilities. Disabilities are addressed in the Americans with Disabilities Act, or ADA.

Nice! DEI is racist.

UVA has a massive endowment. They do not need to do this.

Wonderful! Good riddance to this divisive nonsense:)

Good for them.

Students should be selected for admission based on academic merit, bit gender and skin color.

"No no we're fine... we actually would like another nazi march"

Take notes, and never forget who signed up to be a collaborator. Whether it’s in 2 years, 5 years, or 20 years, these scumbags will someday try to deny their role.

Most of the activities will still be done just under a different heading. This is largely semantics.

Just to be clear, Columbia effectively pre complied with the Trump administration BS and the trump administration still came for them. The idea that colleges/universities can prostrate themselves before this admin and that'll save them isn't backed by basic reality, nor has history shown pre compliance being an effective measure against fascists and authoritarians. This all ignores the enormous resources at college/university disposal, and the integration these institutions have with their local economies and geographically disbursed alumni groups. These institutions have an enormous amount of power they could use, if they chose to. An organized coalition of higher education institutions could destroy this administration if they wanted to, but most higher education leaders aren't wired to fight. It is massively wrong to assume appeasement and otherwise keeping their mouths shut is the best way for higher education institutions to protect themselves because it won't, the trump administration will not leave them alone, its literally what this admin has already shown. Its fight or die, and it would behoove this institutions to learn that sooner rather than later

Or they could fight? Georgetown Law is. This is shameful by the university

What's the point of having a T10 law school if you don't use it?

Columbia has done everything it could to appease Trump and help law enforcement and they *still* got shanked

UVA is not dependent on Federal money for its solvency Those of you who are downvoting me, some recent numbers: In 2023 , UVA got about $280 million from federal grants In that same period UVA's total revenue was 5.5 billion, so Federal grants made up about 5%. UVA's endowment is about 13 billion. It could cover Federal funding 46 times over. I repeat: UVA is not dependent on Federal money for its solvency.

I just googled. UVA has an endowments totaling around $14.2 billion. Columbia also has an endowment equaling more than $14 billion. Harvard has over $53 billion.

It’s alarming how many people in a UVA sub don’t know how the school operates. Youngkin has done like 4 or 5 rounds of appointments to the board. Why would they not echo the same Trump-supporting decisions he does? Hopefully people remember in November that gubernatorial elections also have consequences.

Larry Sabato, founder and director of the UVA Center for Politics: The University of Virginia "has been practically taken over by the federal government and Department of Justice."

Vote for Abigail Stanberger in November to be the next governor.

You've got to change the state gov't to have any chance to stand up to DoJ in court. The current state attorney general / governor isn't going to do anything.

Larry Sabato is one of the University's most prominent and respected professors. He made this remark at minute 9:15 of an interview with France24 on Wednesday, July 16. [https://www.france24.com/en/video/20250716-trump-admin-in-denial-over-climate-change-having-cut-funding-to-noaa-and-national-weather-service](https://www.france24.com/en/video/20250716-trump-admin-in-denial-over-climate-change-having-cut-funding-to-noaa-and-national-weather-service)

Show Glenn Youngkin the door and we’d have a better shot at standing up to him. I wonder how often Trump will come campaign for Sears?

What hasn’t these days. . . for a party that hates cancel culture and censorship they have sure went out of their way to ensure that voices they don’t like are stopped.

No donations from me.

Completely insane.

Didn’t Barron get in there? No? Hmmm

Good, it’s about time!

Embarrassing institution.

Bet his crystal ball didn’t see this coming!

Too bad they can’t figure out a way to go private so they could give the Administration the finger. If they don’t, I’m afraid the Administration will destroy one of the best universities in the country.

Drama from the side that is losing political power. Ho hum. Carry on.

Register for your absentee ballot NOW! https://vote.gov/

If anything the current GOP collaborationist bootlicking Gov and AG will facilitate DOJ takeover.

He’s a legend and has been with UVA for decades

They’ll miss your past donations of zero dollars

NYU is more liberal than UVA. Not sure what point you’re trying to make

Yeah but DOJ has clamped down on private units too.

You seriously think the federal DOJ taking over a state university is just "drama" and we should "carry on"? Traitors like you should hang.

Demanding the president of one of the country's best public universities immediately resign just weeks before the start of a new academic year is not politics as usual. It is Trump wanting to burn everything to the ground just to make a point. Ryan was going to retire in a couple years anyway. They could have just negotiated a closure of uvas DEI office and programs, but that wasn't enough for them. They went scorched earth just because they could. They are doing the exact OPPOSITE of what they say they want- for the feds to stay out of education and let the states handle it.

Quisling bastard.

And vote for Jay Jones, Democratic nominee for Attorney General!

Uh ….. that wasn’t a boot.

How do you really feel?

I’m old enough, and have lived here long enough, to remember when he was president of the UVA student council. I was in high school at the time.

UVA just like other private universities receives government funds and therefore must comply with federal law

And uva could go private if it wanted to, but they dont.

Well said. Thank you

I was assaulted at the game today. I am a member of the Marching Virginians (VT’s marching band). During halftime, me and some other band members attempted to meet up with members from UVA’s band. As we were waiting, two UVA fans walked over and got right in my friend’s face, yelling various derogatory things about VT. I got closer and attempted to intervene at which point they grabbed me, knocked my glasses to the ground, and threw my hat into a tree, where as far as I know it still is. They then attempted to do the same thing to another member of the band, breaking his sunglasses in the process and called him a slur. It took them trying to do the same thing to multiple other members for security to finally step in and kick them out. Do better.

Saw way too much of this today and it makes me so sad. The amount of jokes I heard from VT fans today about the shooting was absolutely deplorable- and UVA fans apparently weren’t much better. Kind of hoped after the events of last year we would all realize that some things are bigger than football, but I guess not. Embarrassing on both sides.

Cavalier Marching Band member here. To those saying this isn't true - it absolutely is. It was witnessed, reported, and corroborated by multiple CMB members, staff, alumni, even some of the directors. Please lay off this person. They've had a bad enough day already without you all piling on. To you, u/Same-Bear-2332, I'm so sorry this happened. I wish there was more to say, and I hope you and the rest of the MVs know that the CMB was thrilled to have you all there. (Thanks as well for waving to us before our show.) I'm so, so disappointed that our own classmates decided to treat you so poorly. Conduct like that is completely unacceptable, rivalry or no. You don't deserve that. I'm sending the best to you all.

I’m really sorry that happened to you - and glad those assholes got kicked out. Rivalries and a little trash talk are supposed to be fun. This isn’t. You shouldn’t feel unsafe at a sporting event.

man, that really sucks—people take this stupid rivalry too far. i’ve heard people say awful things on both sides (you’d think people would have the sense to leave the shooting out of a sports rivalry), but i’m really sorry y’all were physically hurt. side note, i’m not quite sure a subreddit primarily for uva students is the best place to tell fans to do better

Lol at screaming “Our State” as if JMU wouldn’t whip the dogshit out of you

Blaming a whole sub because of the actions of two idiots that are almost certainly unrelated to this group of people? I am sorry to hear you had a rough day, but pinning this problem on other people isn't the way to solve it. Do better.

Call the police. Stop screaming into the void.

Im sorry that happened to you. Not sure why ppl are trolling in this thread, that sucks and shouldn’t happen to anyone regardless of what school they go to

I’m sorry that happened to you fr, idk what to say about that it’s pretty dam awful. With that being said I’ve never seen downright awful humans as I had when VT comes to Charlottesville, you would think a school that had a shooting themselves would be a bit more sensitive and not constantly talk about the Virginia shooting while wearing a jersey of an evil dog killer. Sorry that happened to you, but the “do better” is corny when all I’ve seen from VT since the late 90’s has been just pure hatred

I'm sure this is a thing that happened.

I’m sorry that happened and I’m even sorrier that you thought it appropriate to come here and blame these people for what happened. How’s about we go over to whatever sub VT has and blame everyone there for 4/16/07? That would be ridiculous. Don’t do this. There are good and kind people at UVA, just as there are at VT.

So sorry about this. I’ve heard from CMB that Tech fans after the game were getting in their face while they tried to leave yelling all kinds of vulgar things

Average football fan behavior

Poor baby. You act like this only happens to your school. Don’t intervene between assholes if you don’t know what’s best for you.

UVA fans will really do all this just for our team to get fucking railed on the field, smh be better guys

Sounds like you went into the student section. It isn’t your fault this happened obviously, but you shouldn’t put yourself in dangerous situations

They live in Charlottesville lmao what did you expect OP

Wild for a high school game.

You're a better person than I am, I would have probably fought them.

Sorry this happened, awful. Does the program have tons of spare hats or should we try to find and mail it to you? (serious question).

How did you try to intervene? You say it started with name calling, then when you got close to them and intervened it escalated to a physical altercation

I’m so sorry this happened to you and your bandmates, that is completely unacceptable. I will never understand how what is supposed to be a friendly school rivalry has devolved over the years into something so toxic. Fans/students from both schools have behaved very poorly and we need to do better.

Bullying a band geek. Classic

Average UVA student

Really appalling. I attended UVa in the early 1970s. Got assaulted. Girl coming to visit me got arm broken on Rugby Road. Threats. Attacks on cyclists. Too much violence. I was even assaulted.

You sound like a pussy

I’ve only ever been to one away game (JMU marching band member here), and that was at UVA. They were quite rude as we were walking past them to get into the stadium (booing, saying go back to Harrisonburg, etc…). I don’t know if this is normal or not for marching bands coming from other schools, but being rude to the band just isn’t the way to go. The JMU fans there made it worth it, though. Will say, the people I met from UVA’s band were absolutely lovely and I’m happy to have gotten the chance to meet some of them I’m sorry to hear you had to go through all that, and I hope you’re doing okay now

Real. Another thing, saw some fellow VT fans carving chunks out of the sod to take home as souvenirs… after y’all’s staff literally let us onto the field to chill with our team after a long day and hard loss. Have some respect, everyone.

VT fans should know just as much as UVA fans how traumatizing a school shooting can be to a campus, student population, and fan base. Disgusting.

VT fans clearly don’t know their own history if they are making jokes about the shooting. Neither event is appropriate to joke about but Tech, of all schools, should absolutely not joke about it.

I mean football fans are typically from the very bottom barrel of humanity

This is rich UVA fans complaining about jokes about the shooting, almost like You're forgetting the Way Wahoo fans treated the cho shooting. I can remember a lot more 'Chokie' comments that year coincidentally. Spare me your pretend outrage

My husband was at the game—he said a lot of the fans were absolutely wasted, but the UVA fans were particularly bad. Lots of hard alcohol smuggled in. Wouldn’t shock me if the people who did this to OP were under the influence. :/

Thank you for the genuine and empathetic response. This was a refreshing find compared to other replies and what I expected from the quality people who attend or have attended UVA.

JMU is having a good year playing trash schools. VT and uva sports are both superior athletic schools. They can’t claim to own the state being 11-1 when they don’t play any good football teams.

Y’all were lucky to beat us this year. Had the game not been delayed we would have beat JustMissedVirginia. The Hokies would kick jmu’s ass

Pretty sure both schools could whip the dogshit out of JMU, they didn’t play anybody of note

"My Daddy would kick your ass!"

I don’t recall JMU beating UVA 55-17… Pretty sure we’d whoop they ass too

Historically, VT has only lost one game to JMU in NCAA history, and that was in overtime...not exactly what I call "whip the dogshit." Now, look at VT vs UVA's history in the past 20 years alone. That is what I call "whipping the dogshit out of you!"

VT would beat the shit out of JMU. You don’t know ball

An open letter encouraging kindness and calling out a few specific people isn’t an attack on the whole subreddit I’d say.

Did OP edit their post? Struggling to find where they blamed all of r/UVA and “pinned” the problem on other people. I feel like maybe people should “do better” at reading comprehension.

Nah posts that make uva students feel bad about themselves benefit everyone

Because this is an obviously troll-y post, even if half true. I don’t know where people got this idea we have to treat peoples absolutely retarded behavior with some level or respect and decorum just because they’re alleging malfeasance. EDIT: it seems as though OP has edited his post and removed the troll-y content which i alluded to above.

I went to Tech and believe me when I say Michael Vick is revered there. They retired his jersey at one of the games I went to and he had a several minute standing ovation. He apparently also gets applause when he’s in the audience at a big game. I’ve asked my friends at Tech about this and they said “he served his time and has stayed out of trouble since.” I never really understood it. Never liked how athletes can get a pass for shitty behavior. Weird thing is, The people caping for him never even watched Michael Vick at Tech. They might not have even been alive when he played too

We did it. Holy shit we did it.

That was the best atmosphere I’ve seen at Scott stadium in a long time.!

Stormed the field as a 1st year when UVA upset Florida St in 05’

Epic field storm. Proud of those kids. Wellness check on the FSU receiver… Go HOOS!

Sitting in a hotel bar in Atlanta, watching the game end. Sang the Good Ole Song.

I won't be able to sleep for hours, this was absolutely insane.

…..is this what happiness feels like?

Never would’ve thought I see our football team actually be good for once and win against a top 10 team, absolute cinema

UVA should be ranked next week

The guy who flipped off Castellanos... lmao

Fantastic game! Way to go Coach! Way to go Team! WAHOOWA!!!

Are the players caught in the middle of it ok😭

$50k and worth every dollar.

Great job uva. I’m a terp alumni we used to be the acc so I still watch the games

So proud of Coach. He's a great guy and I'm so happy to see him having success. He deserves it. Great work, Tony.

The field goal wouldn’t go down

Beat UMBC? I kid I kid

There in spirit 🧡💙

BS all y’all did was barley stop one of the greatest football comebacks I’ve ever seen

19 fans injured. Refs couldn’t even make the final call cause silly geese ran on the field, for what? They didn’t play in the game. SHM in embarrassment. Do better cavalier fans.

I mean to be fair, it looked like most of the hill literally just entered the stadium for the first time in the fourth quarter. It look like tons of people left at half time actually

I vividly remember the game in 95, was a school night but I got to stay up late because it was close. When they stopped Dunn on the last play we absolutely lost it, can’t believe that was 30 years ago. Top 5 uva sports moment for me and tonight might have topped it!

I was a 4th year, was there too!

I helped take down the goalpost!

I remember '19 too. The Jefferson-Eppes Trophy remains ours!

Me too! We the same age

The field was instantly full! Amazing.

While I love the sentiment of storming the field as a fan, you know it cost UVa athletics $500,000 and was paid to FSU

When I was at UVA in the late 80s, we were actually ranked #1 ... for a week.

Nah. People have been burned before. Put up performances like that for the next few games though?

I caught that too.

Please explain the $50K?

Back during the renno in 98 they put in goals engineered specifically to prevent a pull down. I don't know how many times they've come down since but I bet it's not a lot

Literally took their coach. If you can’t beat ‘em, become them.

Ahhh...the gripes of a semen-hole! Classic.

And you guys continued your great tradition of missing field goals wide right.

Nah most people stayed. They blocked people from entering the field until near the end because of space, when people moved up they let people in. Though to be honest it kind of looked like they just forced past security and then they let it happen

If it’s any consolation - there were students who weren’t allowed in until halftime because The Hill was full.

Poindexter!!! With the stop!

I was there too as an alumna!

I was a 1L at that game, having graduated that May. My wife was in your class.

50k, not 500

R/confidentlyincorrect.

not paid to FSU either.

I remember that, my fourth year, Moore to Moore!

Let's be better than this.

One drunk knucklehead a fan base does not make.

The pearl clutching over this today is hilarious. Was it tacky? Sure. Was the dude just caught up in the moment, and probably also drunk? Yes. I wouldn’t want to see my kid doing this, but I also don’t want this guy to suffer any consequences. People are talking about doxxing him, about honor code violations and a bunch of other crap. Let’s all keep it in perspective. A one time classless decision that shouldn’t have any repercussions.

Let it go. It was literally a nano second at real speed.

Meh. Who cares

Come on man Castellanos is getting paid a cool million for this season he can take it

Omg fingers????? The MIDDLE??????

Oh stfu and stop being so soft. These players say far worse to each other during the game.

They would’ve done the same shit in Tallanasty…I hope yall saw when the FSU player trampled a UVA camera guy and ran away thick as thieves and when a UVA guy fell on the FSU sideline and not a single Nole lifted a finger to help him up. You want to talk about lack of grace…look at FSU.

I'll fuckin' do it again

Castellanos will be hitting that kid as his financial advisor in a few years

These people exist in literally every fan base.

I didn’t love it but I am MUCH more concerned about the fan skipping leg days.

Was this even a student?

Just let him have a moment of fun. Wins like this don’t happen often.

but this is who you are

FSU fan here. As far as I'm concerned, if Castellanos fucked up and couldn't get the job done, and was running his damn mouth, he deserved it. Maybe it'll teach him to keep his mouth shut and focus on making sure he can get the job done.

Let college kids be college kids. We need to make bad decisions to regret later in life.

Yeah, theyre just kids. College football fans are the worst.

Y’all talk like the players themselves don’t do this kinda shit every game lol

Identify and shame.

literally who cares he deserved it he lost he gets millions to win. don't win = shamed. and im not a fan of any team here idgaf ant college football but bro gotta grow this skin

If it were other fans doing it to UVA players, I bet you lot would be calling for better treatment and higher standards. 😅 You guys downvoted the person saying just because it’s “normal” or players do worse to each other, doesn’t mean we should be okay with it.

Counterpoint: fuck Castellanos

Oh no! Drunk guy having fun!

FSU fan here. I was at the game and surrounded by the classiest UVA fans. Had a GREAT time. Good game!

I don’t mind students/fans expressing themselves. But what bothered me it was on the field. What sucks is the pictue is tagged to the individual and hopefully it doesn’t affect their future.

Lmfao I laughed way too hard this

Hey!!! Thats me

The players are making money and want to be pros. Pros get flipped off all the time

Come on now, he’s got a lot of class, but it’s all low!

Let’s do it again

Don’t lose and you don’t get a middle finger. 🖕

Let’s keep It classy UVA

I'd like to see more behavior like this! What a hero.

Cry more. You are not better than this.

Dude is making $1mil + on NIL this year, if some underclassman wants flick him off, he should be able to take it!!!

Exhibit A: things a fan base does when its not used to winning anything

That was a FSU fan. Lol

all this just to lose to louisville next week, lmao

Agreed. Preposterous that that guy is treated like he's some kind of hero.

Crazy being that grown and doing that to a young kid

It’s always a joke or an excuse…so effing tired of the double standard

Generally not okay, but I make an exception here because it’s the ‘Noles. They’ve been disrespecting other teams for decades. Go wild man!

Guarantee I know who he voted for.

Sadly, I've seen worse than this at UVA events.

You just generalized groups. I mean kind of like the bloodthirsty murder supporting people on the left…

Thomas Jefferson on the role of government/the BOV and universities

It is shocking and saddening that the Jefferson Council is so antithetical to UVAs eponymous founder

Like this asshole: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Cuccinelli

I’m appalled by this President and his administration.

Why did they pick such a dumb name for an executive board

Jefferson also voted to ban firearms on campus.

Is there anywhere we can organize to protect the university? I would love to join a Facebook or discord or anywhere we in charlottesville can plan to protect the freedoms of the students and faculty of the University. If one dosn't exist I would be interested in starting one, message me if you know anything or are interested.

Probably shouldn't be a public school if it doesn't want government influence. Just doesn't really work that way.

Well, he didn't take his own advice. Central College, as it was originally called, required huge state funding so that it could be completed and open for its first students. UVa should go private, or comply with the law of the entities that fund it (federal and state).

Well, those guys suck, so. Always have.

Ken Cuccinelli: *hold my beer*

The Jefferson Council was formed in 2020. It is not the same as the governing board of UVA

Sure. But it’s a state school, not a federal one. The federal government shouldn’t be interfering with its governance. Republicans are all about “states rights,” after all. Until they aren’t. 🙄

Right? If you don’t want federal government influence, then politely decline the money as well. There are always strings attached when dealing with the government.

What laws do you think UVa was not complying with? And are you comfortable with the concept that courts, not individuals, decide if a law has been broken?

tell us which laws are being broken.

I'm taking about board of visitors lol

It's getting a ton of federal funding, there are always strings attached.

Extortion is not a valid “attached string”

There have always been “strings attached,” that’s not what this is. This is blackmail.

Strings not chains.

Not really. UVA had about 250 million out of a budget of 3.3 billion dollars or less than 10%

Did you just claim that's a small amount? And if you did, then how is this small amount so important that it got the president to resign?

Yes in comparison to other R1 research universities, it is not a large about of money and with 14 Billion in endowment, they make more money than that in interest every year. As for why he resigned, look at the pressure they have put on UCLA, Harvard, Columbia and others.

The bridge claimed another victim today - this time in video form

the person knew they wouldn’t make it and decided to capture it for us!

r/PraiseTheCameraMan

The Barber of C'ville.

So the city knows this is an ongoing problem that costs people tons of money, grief, and property damage. And instead of simply installing a cheap hanging bar before the bridge, like at a McDonald’s drive through, so you hit the bar and make a noise before actually hitting the bridge, they just do nothing and continue to allow people to damage vehicles and potentially the bridge too?

Whats going on here was the guy on top of the bus??

Where was this? I'm in va

How do you not know when you are driving a vehicle that is over the standard height. How do you not know the height of your vehicle. My vehicle is 56.1”

Please tell me you honked at them rather than just hoping it would happen for your video

There’s a bridge in my area that’s low and not very wide. A familiar call came over the police scanner that a truck had hit the bridge. A couple hours later, another call. The company had sent a second truck to pick up the cargo from the first truck. It was coming from the other direction and hit the bridge 🤦‍♀️

But where is the bridge

Is that by the hospital?

"Hate to see it" I probably would hate to see it if I could

Man that bus is worth like 80k too. These people…

Not the hero we deserve...

Well, they caught the build up. When the actual action started it seems like they had a seizure

Enjoy the karma!

Capture what? The video shows nothing

Damn that is good

Wow. Cheers.

Another head chopped

There are signs, and any physical warning device at an early enough spot will also hit vehicles turning right onto 14th st. It is also why audible signals aren’t popular. BTW, that bridge isn’t taking any damage. It is quite stout.

maybe, take responsibility in the vehicle you are driving and know your clearance height.

This 14th street bridge on The Corner is famously known for destroying tall vehicles (trucks, RVs, etc.) that think they can clear it. Because of its awkwardly low height, drivers often don’t realize they can’t clear it, and essentially rip off the tops of their vehicles frequently. This is almost a weekly occurrence during the school year.

14th Street bridge. Right next to Boylan Heights

I got the video from a friend on snapchat

I have stabilized the video for you: https://gfycat.com/GrotesqueEnviousAzurewingedmagpie ___ ^^[&nbsp;how&nbsp;to&nbsp;use](https://www.reddit.com/r/stabbot/comments/72irce/how_to_use_stabbot/)&nbsp;|&nbsp;[programmer](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=wotanii)&nbsp;|&nbsp;[source&nbsp;code](https://gitlab.com/juergens/stabbot)&nbsp;|&nbsp;/r/ImageStabilization/&nbsp;|&nbsp;for&nbsp;cropped&nbsp;results,&nbsp;use&nbsp;\/u/stabbot_crop

Not even the hero we need, but the hero we want.

As per usual

I’ve been to this intersection regularly and additional warning devices would not be impossible. Even in a worse case scenario I’d rather have false audible alarms than an accident. And constant collisions to that bridge cause abrasions that lead to oxidation.

Calculating the true clearance is tricky, since the bridge is positioned at the very bottom of a dip in the road. In this case, it looks like the vehicle would have cleared it if the road was flat. But due to its length it wound up straddling the dip, thus raising the back of the roof just enough to get caught.

Wow it’s almost like accidents happen to normal good drivers. There’s a reason this bridge is constantly a problem. Also very often it’s people in U-Haul box trucks. But I guess expecting everyone to be perfect 24/7 is better than an easy solution that fixes the problem.

Do you live/work right there? There have been audible signals in the past. Don’t know the current status. They were loud when I was a grad student. People that lived/worked there took it upon themselves to disable them. There was a bus that came down w main and turned on 14th. Every 30 min a horn going off. And people still hit the bridge.

Okay, so make flashing lights instead of an audible warning. We sent men to the moon half a decade ago. This bridge thing isn’t exactly an unsolvable or difficult to solve problem. It’s extreme negligence by the city. Edit: half a century ago

UVA swimmer Emma Weyant just won silver at the Olympics. Congrats and wahoowa!

That's amazing!

Let’s GOOOOO

PSA: Saying "I'm going to watch this lecture recording later" is probably the worst lie you'll tell yourself Speaking from the experience of a semester of online classes; it'll start out as "I'll watch them tonight", then move onto "I'll catch up on these eventually" and it'll end with you "catching up" on 15 lectures the night before a midterm. The semester's still young so thought I'd put this out there: online classes can be tricky, make sure you're making good decisions.

If it helps, I strongly suspect the profs can see if we view the lectures or not, and will use that info in determining participation marks.

Truer words have seldom been spoken

Only slightly worse then "I'm going to this party and surely, I don't need a mask"

What's wrong with watching 15 lectures in a night?

Yep I’m already 2.5 chapters behind

Thank you for the reminder

I usually follow through. There a difference between being a procrastinator and a functioning procrastinator. It’s possible to make it work for yourself

That's why I only let my students access the meeting recordings if they prove me they faced some technical difficulty during lecture time or are not in the American continent. I would personally do the same and ruin my entire semester.

Can confirm, if they’re on collab, they can see if you have, and even how much you have watched

They can actually check how long you’ve accessed their canvas page for, so they can take a pretty good guess if you did or didn’t watch the lectures if you only have 6 hours logged onto the Canvas classroom when there’s probably over 48 hours worth of lecture time.

I genuinely want to talk about this, and sometimes, especially over writing, I come off as rude and dismissive, so know ahead of time that I respect your position and want to understand it better. I’ve taken the viewpoint that if my students fail or struggle, then that is an opportunity for them to learn. By taking away options from them - for example, by removing their ability to watch recordings - I feel I am punishing those that really have self control and would benefit from watching the lectures at a different time, and I am punishing, at least in the long run, those that are going to fail or do poorly because they mishandled the responsibility I gave them.

Huh, you're my ta.

I decided to follow this protocol after reading students frustrations about online teaching and how they don't feel motivated on watching a pre-recorded lecture video. I really thought this would be good for them but judging the number of downvotes this comment received it might be not. If someone has a different opinion I would love to hear it as I only want to provide my students with the best teaching experience possible. I personally don't like the idea of a strategy that punishes students, even if this happens in the long run. Those who can handle online teaching well will succeed anyways. I believe my job is to make the difference for those who wouldn't do as good on their own.

I have a feeling that the down votes reflect the opinions of people, but it might not reflect that your idea is bad (that many downvotes really seems excessive to me, but I know if I was a student I would be a bit upset if I *felt* someone was taking away agency from me). I'm not an expert on teaching, so what I was saying really is just my opinion. Perhaps you could talk with your students and try to properly set up expectations? I've found my reviews often primarily reflect how well I communicated to a class. That is to say, even if I had given the exact same material as someone else, people's opinion of my class was mainly changed by the way I conveyed my thoughts and expectations for my students and the structure of the class.

\>Those who can handle online teaching well will succeed anyways. I believe my job is to make the difference for those who wouldn't do as good on their own. This is a really good impulse, but be mindful that the online teaching experience of 2019 and before is very dissimilar to the online teaching of today. Attitudes and culture are shifting constantly--even for those students who might have failed in a pre-COVID online classroom. This is no longer an isolated activity you do on your own time: Every single student in every college across the US is facing this new normal together. I think we ought to allow them the space to figure it out. Maybe that means allowing them to try new behaviors. Luckily I'm not teaching this semester so good luck figuring it out, let me know how it goes lol

As someone who has really benefited from being able to go back and watch lectures both directly after the lecture and in order to study for exams, you could still offer the recorded lectures as an option for anyone regardless of technology issues but include some sort of live attendance/participation grade (unless they are in a different time zone of course). I feel like proving that you had a technology issue might be kind of difficult. Even for me just today, I lost connection for only about 5 minutes during my lecture and am going to benefit from going back and being able to take notes on the quick part that I missed

UVA policy says that if you have a participation grade, you specifically CANNOT record class or post recordings.

That's weird. Is there a reason they give for that?

Damn I didn’t know that. I have a few professors who are doing both...Regardless, I think recording lectures for students to watch isn’t a bad idea, if the feature is available why not use it?

Gotta protect your educational records b/c of FERPA. recordings provide publicly viewable evidence of students earning or not earning credit.

[https://uvapolicy.virginia.edu/policy/PROV-005](https://uvapolicy.virginia.edu/policy/PROV-005) I just read the policy. Not here to say whether I agree or whether profs will actually do it.

I thought it was okay as long as they were indonesi protected location, ie collab, which has other FEEPA data

Would this also include professors that uses clicker questions in class to look for participation?

That makes sense! I hadn't thought about that at all.

In Collab you can't see other people earn or not earn grades, which is the difference. so you can't see anyone else's educational records in Collab unless they choose to show you.

[https://uvapolicy.virginia.edu/policy/PROV-005](https://uvapolicy.virginia.edu/policy/PROV-005) Take a look and judge for yourself. I think that if you can ascertain someone earning or not earning credit from the video its a no go. Clicker is probably a gray area depending on how they do it.

asynchronous classes are dangerous

It was a bad week to start watching The Sopranos

As someone who recently picked up online chess as a hobby, I don’t recommend it. It’s both a waste of time and it lowers self esteem bc I’m on a 5 game losing streak and I get mated the exact same way every fucking day. It’s pure proof of my idiocy. Edit: just got my daily queen-knight corner mate. Will I ever learn? Probably not.

Check out John Bartholomew and/or Ben Finegold. Two different styles, both highly entertaining.

Wait why. I was just going to. Edit: wait oh bc of classes?

Yo I wanna start watching it!

The learning curve is really steep. It’s hard to get good and you lose a lot, which can be demoralizing, but once you get good, you stay good. Then it gets a lot better lol

agreed. Queen’s gambit really over-glamorizes. It’s neither sexy nor fun

Did it work?

Just give us our money and no rules to follow like everything else these days

You’re talking about it, aren’t you?

Man, you’re like a dog with a bone. Well, maybe not - people like dogs.

That’s boring and beta as fuck

Protesting is glorified complaining, so it probably worked about as well as that guys comment

Nice -57 comment karma.

Yeah, I’d probably be drowning in fake internet points if I just shut up, smiled, and regurgitated whatever sanitized groupthink people want to hear. But I’d rather be real than liked 🤷

You’re neither, so.

Can you explain to me how these people's signs and posting comments on reddit is going to meaningfully effect change in the universities new policy of cucking to fascists for money? (the answer is you can't explain to me how either of these do anything other than make the people doing it feel better about THEMSELVES)

Oh OK sorry nevermind your protesting and comments actually resolved the issue and made a huge difference you are a hero, do you like me now consensus based reality inhabitant?

It’s really upsetting and pathetic how narrow minded and short sighted you have to be to expect immediate and radical results from activism, have you ever even wanted anything bad?

The Incoming First-Year 'All Your Questions Answered Here!' MEGATHREAD I always see so many threads, every year, asking the same thing. So I figured I'd make one big thread for incoming first years to have the most common questions answered! My current fellow 'hoos, please feel free to add to what I've written or make some corrections! And of course, On my Honor as a Student, I have neither given nor received aid on this thread creation. *Pertaining to Academics:* * **How does UVA compare to high school?** Look, I'm going to be honest with you (I will not Lie, Cheat, or Steal). College is different. In some ways it's harder, and in some ways it's easier. Yes, you don't have your mom and dad hovering over you every minute of every day. No, that does not mean you should go crazy and party every day. High school was very structured. Everything was lain out for you neatly. You got up at x time every day and went to school, sat in your assigned seat, and asked to go to the bathroom. Not so in college. I had some days I woke up at 8 am and others at noon. I never ask to go to the bathroom in lecture (because nobody cares if you even show up to class) and everything is due at different times and different days. You will have some structure in the sense your classes are at consistent times - but that's where the similarities stop. Be open-minded. Also, please take showers. You won't believe the amount of stories I hear about people not showering bc Mom and Dad are no longer there to remind them. * **I took x# AP classes. Will this help me get A's at UVA?** Yes, and no. Everything here is a byproduct of what you put in. I took 5 AP classes in junior year and 7 AP classes in senior year. That prepared me a lot to enter a collegiate academic environment but UVA still threw challenges at me. Some things will be easier, like AP Chem helping me in Gen Chem 1 and 2. Some things are just totally foreign, like office hours. Take the experience you have and run with it, but realize it's not a failsafe. You will need to push yourself while here at UVA. * **How hard is it to maintain a 3.6, 3.7, 3.8+ GPA at UVA?** This isn't high school. College is unweighted, so no more walking out with 4.95 or 4.6 or whatever y'all ambled out of high school with (I myself graduated with a 5.2 I think??? which is ridiculous). You WILL be challenged here. If you haven't learned how to study, and just 'read your notes the night before' or 'watch a video and do two problems out of the book' before an exam, you've got a big storm coming. For a small percent of people, that works. But in college, you can't skate by. Be prepared to put in more effort than high school. As with anything, your grades are about what you put in. If you go to office hours, study a few days ahead of time, take good notes, and work lots of problems, you'll be smooth sailing. That being said, you could just be SOL with a bad professor. Do your research on sites like [thecourseforum.com](https://thecourseforum.com) and [ratemyprofessors.com](https://ratemyprofessors.com) to see who you want to take classes with. If you're interested in pre-med classes, PM me. * **I took AP Calc/Chem/Bio in high school! Do I really need to take MATH 1310, etc, at UVA?** I mean, it's up to you. I TA for and have taken MATH 1310 (applied calc 1) and I will say taking AP Calc AB and BC did not prepare me for its difficulty, and I see that with students now. Obviously if you want to take the credit and it's not major essential go for it! But if you took AP Bio in sophomore year and just REALLY want that BS in bio, I recommend you take the intro series again for a refresher. This is a very subjective piece of advice. This is how I feel, as someone who needs to eventually take the MCAT and did not have a super strong bio and chem foundation, even though I did well enough on AP exams. They helped alot and I am glad I took Chem in college to supplement for AP chem, because organic chem expects you to know a lot about MO theory and nucleophiles and electrophiles, etc, which AP Chem doesn't cover. Y'all have been warned but this is contentious. Anyone, feel free to correct me. * **I want to pick out classes right now. Where do I start?** Great! You've committed! Know what major you want? Or even kinda want? Because you should know your major prereqs NOW. Don't be the person stuck trying to apply to neuroscience and taking four prereqs that same semester because you didn't know that MATH 1310 and PSYC 2200 were requirements. Even if you have a slim idea, start thinking about it. **However! It is totally okay to not know right now. Nothing you do first semester can mess up your career goals, such as med school, and you have time.** Take a look at the course catalog on SIS or at Lou's list ( [https://louslist.org/](https://louslist.org/) ) to get more info. Oh, and btw: When the orientation people say pick 25 classes that you want to take to fulfill requirements, they mean it. The likelihood is you won't get into your top 5, or 10, or 15 classes. Be aware you might not take what you want exactly first semester - but that's okay! That's part of expanding your horizons! * **What curriculum should I take?** I recommend Traditional, but this is again highly subjective. Traditional is easiest for me as a premed to fulfill all my requirements without having to take unnecessary extraneous seminar courses. However, Forums curriculum has amazing topics for discussion and their classes are super engaging. New Curriculum has good content as well. If you have more questions, read this link: [https://gened.as.virginia.edu/new-college-curriculum](https://gened.as.virginia.edu/new-college-curriculum) EDIT: I have been told all first years are taking new college. If so, disregard this part * **I want to get into Comm, neuroscience/human biology/global public health, Batten, etc. How hard is that?** Again, a dose of honesty. Not everyone gets in. We can chance and chance you, but at the end of the day, that decision lies with the committee/professor. I recommend you go and talk to the director of that major sooner than later to find out exactly what it's about. Also, make friends with upper classmen in those majors. They have that lived experience and can guide you better. Remember, each class changes year to year. Always have a backup major in your arsenal, but don't let that keep you from reaching for your dreams/goals! Do your best, have a good GPA, have extracurriculars, etc, that match, and hope for the best. And read up on it. Go to your major/program website and figure out if it's for you and what the requirements are. * **Should I take a COLA/USEM course?** I did. I recommend it. It lets you get to know your advisor quite a bit and it's a good 1 credit course on an interesting topic. Mine was on the Rustic Fantasy. I've heard a bunch of topics like Game of Thrones and Harry Potter. Use this as an opportunity to expand your horizons! * **I am an Echols/Rodman Scholar. Is it worth it?** It's a nice boost, at least for Echols, but it's not like you're taking separate Honors classes, UVA doesn't believe in that. Echols/Rodman scholars get their own dorms and priority registration times, as well as some exclusive events and speakers. I believe Rodman also has additional work and projects in addition to the normal SEAS curriculum, someone, please correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe that's the case. It's a nice bonus but you will not have a separate college experience from the rest of us, if that matters to you. I think it's nice to have some integration with the normal community and the extra perks don't hurt! Also, as an Echols, you can design your own interdisciplinary major, which is awesome. EDIT: I have been told to add that this designation removes gen ed requirements as well. Sorry I forgot to add! * **I did not get Echols/Rodman. How can I get in?** Hey, me neither. You can apply, at least for Echols, in the summer before your second year. However, be aware that they take a very select few and there seems to be little rhyme or reason to it. You can have a worthwhile UVA experience without being Echols/Rodman! The 90-95% of us who are not Scholars are living proof of this - trust me, don't let this one thing preclude you from joining our amazing community! * **I am pre-med. Will going to UVA net me a worse GPA than going elsewhere?** I've found pre-med classes here to be pretty fair. Definitely there isn't grade inflation but there isn't grade deflation. If you put the work in, and you care about what you're learning, you will do well. Remember medical school is not just a formula of GPA + MCAT and there are other things that go into it. Work hard, keep your head on straight, and you will do fine. PM me if you've got more questions. * **How does my AP credit transfer to UVA?** You can check more info here: [https://college.as.virginia.edu/ap-credit](https://college.as.virginia.edu/ap-credit) . However, you won't really truly know until you see the information in your SIS account once that's assigned to you, you can see it. To see your AP credit, do this: go to your left hand sidebar and click the dropdown on academics. You should see either unofficial transcript or academic requirements. Both will tell you how much AP credit you have been rewarded. * **How is first-year advising at UVA?** Honestly, not great. Don't expect a lot. Do your own research and approach professors within your department of choice for better information. That's all I'll leave it add. Anyone, feel fre to add your thoughts. * **How can I get involved in research at UVA?** Great question! Research is such an amazing thing and I will say UVA is an exception amongst top schools and universities in the sense that professors are so here to help you get into research and get you into the lab alongside them. For me, I sent a lot of emails. I emailed like 26 professors and only got responses from a few, but by my Spring semester of my first year, I was able to get into a research lab I still currently remain in. Professors, even if they can't admit you to their lab, can help point you to others that do have room in their labs. Keep emailing, and keep working on it! Do not let silence get you down - you WILL find a lab if you are persistent! Also, research is available through work-study programs, which I know less about, but if you qualify, is another amazing way to get research. Also USOAR is a great option to apply to and find research, here is the link if you are interested: [https://undergraduateresearch.virginia.edu/our-opportunities/usoar](https://undergraduateresearch.virginia.edu/our-opportunities/usoar) TLDR: Don't give up! Keep on trying for research! * **I have heard a lot of scary things about the Honor system. Can you tell me more?** First and foremost, don't let it intimidate you. It might seem scary to read about it online, it might be scary to hear about it at the signing of the roll, but you shouldn't let it scare you! A small amount of the UVA population deal with Honor and an even smaller percent go to trial. You should be aware of it - it's the reason why you can leave your backpack in the hallway and nobody will touch it - we live in a Community of Trust where we all hold each other accountable. Just don't cheat, and then don't worry about it - Honor is not out there to get you. Make smart choices! Honor is a contentious topic. Not everyone will agree with me. People in the comments, feel free to disagree! More info for those interested: [https://honor.virginia.edu/](https://honor.virginia.edu/) * **How are professors at UVA?** In my experience, most are really willing to help you if you show that you care about the subject material and want to do well. In my time going to office hours, I have never had a professor belittle me or not care about what I was asking them. Of course, there are outliers. There are professors that are known for being butt-awful, and you will hear about them. Make sure to do your research on the course forum and rate my professor before you enroll in a class. Talk to friends/peers about what they think. Use the resources at your disposal. For the most part, I think professors are great and care a lot about their students, however, there are exceptions, as there are at any University. That being said, I think UVA has a great group of faculty that really care about you as a student and your future prospects! * **Is college hard?** Well yes, but no. In some ways it will be more challenging than others. I will say with certainty that it gets easier over time, and generally that the first semester of first year is most challenging. Obviously, this isn't an ironclad rule that applies to everyone, but this is something I generally see as a trend. It will be tough first semester. For many of you, it's the first time you've left home for an extended period of time, or had to live with a roommate. You will feel like you don't have friends (everyone feels this way at some point, if they say otherwise, 99% chance they're lying!) and that you are alone at college. There are moments where you'll sit up and be like "shit, I feel like I'm failing!" Those feelings are normal. Every first year goes through them, and most of the time, by second semester, you will have found your place morseo here at UVA. However, that isn't always the case for everyone. Some people take it easier, some people take it harder. Know you aren't alone. Every social and academic struggle is not unique to you, and I encourage you to reach out. Reach out to your RA, your professor, your roommate, your mom/dad, home friends, CAPS. College is different. It's going to feel different. Embrace that difference, and seek help if you need it. &#x200B; *Pertaining to Residence Life / Student Life:* * **Can I pick what dorm I live in first year?** No, not how it works. If you have disability needs, please let SDAC know immediately so they can accommodate you. I promise you that whatever dorm you get, you're gonna have a unique and amazing experience. :) You can pick your roommate though! * **How do I find a roommate? Should I live with someone I know or someone random?** Lots of ways! You can room with friends from high school (but I suggest not to, you want to meet new people!), go random, or meet someone on your class facebook page. I met my roommate there. I recommend getting out of your comfort zone and meeting some new, amazing people! Know always that living with a stranger can have its pros and cons. Who knows? You could meet your best friend! (But don't feel bad if you and your roommate don't click, that happens more often than not) * **How are RA's here at UVA?** I mean, I am an RA, so I am a little biased... But i will say every RA I know, even when I wasn't one, is super duper nice! They are there for you, not to bust you or to write you up. Don't be scared! Approach them, be their friend (we love that). We are resources for you. Text us, call us, vent at us - that's what we are here for. We love working with residents, especially in guiding our first year ones! Also, don't drink in dorms. That's pretty easy, right? * **I got assigned to Gooch/Dillard, and I am bummed. How is living there?** I see this. Every. year. Look, I lived in Dillard two years in a row. It really is NOT as bad as you think, I promise. There are THREE bus stops that serve that area, and a dining hall right there. Is it far? Yes. You get used to it. It's not that much of an inconvenience and you stop noticing it after a while. Also, the suite style living is much better when it comes to the bathroom situation - instead of 45 guys/girls you're sharing it with, it's 5 or 6 others. Similarly, the rooms are bigger and the heat and air are perfect. You get your own common room and get to bond with your suitemates. Sure, you'll walk a little farther and climb a few more stairs but your thighs will look great and you'll have the best first year dorm experience (IMO), too. (the only big downside is that you don't really get to bond with your hall in the same way. But you get your suitemates. Could be worse.) * **How do I become an RA at UVA?** Amazing question! There will be info sessions later into Fall semester and the application process will begin in the Spring. I wouldn't worry about it too much right now but definitely talk to your RA about it you are interested! * **I am not much of a partier and heard a lot of UVA students are involved in Greek life. How does that work?** Look, me neither. All I can say is that in my personal experience, you don't need to party or do Greek life to make friends and have fun. Most people I know are not involved in Greek life and those that are are usually not super in your face about it. That being said, i know people who have done Greek like and really enjoyed it and made lasting friends, it's not all just partying and drinking. There are also service and pre-professional fraternities. It's all about what you personally want and who you click with here at UVA. Also, remember UVA is a big place. Your first year pals pressuring you into doing something you're not comfortable with? UVA is a big place. Let your roots grow and spread and find people who you truly care about you! * **Is it easy to maintain a good work/life balance at UVA?** UVA to me is defined by its work-hard, play-hard atmosphere. People here are definitely go-getters but know how to throw down when the day is done. Again, this all boils down to what you want. Taking harder majors, like Biochem, or harder career paths, like pre-comm or pre-med, will inevitably lead to a higher workload than others. That was me, a pre-med declaring a pretty requirement stacked major. That being said, I found time to work, TA, do things I like, and hang out with my friends. Some weekends I had to skip movie nights, and sometimes I studied so much I felt like I was going crazy. However, it comes in waves of exams and you will have time to hang out. I still hangout and facetime with my friends from UVA now even though we're separated by the pandemic! Just set goals, manage time, and even the toughest majors can have thriving social lives :) * **How are UVA libraries?** I like them. We have a lot more than say, Virginia Tech, meaning you have a lot of different spaces to study. My favorite place used to be Alderman stacks (but will likely not study there again in my time at UVA, big sad). Clem is also really nice and recently renovated, with lots of clean seating and outlets. However, it can be a little crowded at times, especially on Sundays and during finals, so keep that in mind (cleanest bathroom is on the 3rd floor, don't @ me). Public Health Sciences is also nice but it's hard to enter if you don't have a medical ID, so keep that in mind. Clark is...meh. People are gonna fight me on this but it's always really crowded and the bathrooms are filthy (at least for women). There are a few others I'm forgetting, and some smaller, major-specific libraries, but I believe I've hit the big ones. Let me know if I missed something. * **How can I get involved at UVA?** Great question! Go to the activities fair in Fall semester. There are so many clubs and orgs, and sign up, sign up - there are so many great things! Also, don't worry if you don't get into a club - many, like Guides or Honor, have applications and are tough to get into, and people often get hung up on that. There are so many other fun things to do that don't require an application. There's things like anime club, and club water polo, and so damn many singing groups, and so so much more. There is a niche for you here, I promise promise, and you should look for it! Talk to people, pay attention to flyers, go to RA's events, and read your emails. Activities fair is the best place to start! (You can also DM me for recs, I do way too much here) * **I am pre-med/pre-law/pre-Comm, etc. I want to get involved with clinical volunteering, campaigning, pre-professional activities. Is UVA good for this? How do I do it?** Yes, and no. Some things, especially pre-professional programs, are harder to get into due to sheer volume of interest. THAT BEING SAID. I did it first year, and so did countless others. Do things ON TIME, do not delay, and make sure you are reaching out to the right people. Joining pre-professional groups like AMSA that don't have membership caps and going to the activities fair are both great ways to find these opportunities for you. * **Can I have a car at UVA as a first-year?** No. Unless you have special circumstances, but like really, really special circumstances. Call Parking and Transportation to find out. But overwhelmingly no. Most first years don't. It's nice because it forces you to adjust and you can't run home too too much. * **I've never been away from home before and I'm scared. What is support like at UVA?** That's okay to feel that. Everybody feels that way. If they say they're not scared of at least one thing, then they're lying. This is the most common feeling among first years. Please go to your RA. They are amazing and here for you. Talk to them. share with them. There is also mental health services for free - CAPs, as an example, or the women's center. Do not hold in your struggles. Also, build a support network. Call home once in a while, stay in touch with your friends with home, and make sure that your network is there. That is so important to fall back on, and whether you're calling twice a day or twice a month, keep these people in your pocket - you'll need them all through college! * **What is the best way to make friends at UVA?** Join orgs! Go to events! Get out of your room! Get as involved as you can in things you like. Talk to people in your classes. Honestly, the biggest way I made friends was just putting myself out there. I know it sounds hard but once you do it it starts getting easier! Just don't sit at your desk all day and wonder why friends don't fall into your lap. Go out and meet people! Also, go your RA's hall events. It's a great way to know the people on your hall, who can become a huge group of friends. Don't limit yourself! * **How does dining work at UVA?** All first-years have to buy an unlimited swipe meal plan - so you can eat at the dining halls as many times a day you like! It's all you can eat too. You also get plus dollars, which can be spent at convenience stores and at food trucks. These are limited however so pay attention to them! You can also get take out a few times a day (not unlimited) from dining halls and use meal swipes after 4:30 at the pav to get subway, chick-fil-a, five guys, and sushi. There are also starbucks and Einstein Bro's among a few other options. You won't be hungry here! * **How is the food at UVA?** I've been pretty vocal at my dislike and lack of vegetarian options, but in reality, it's okay. It's definitely edible and there are some good days. Don't expect gourmet food, but it's not inedible. You get what you get and it pushes you through first year. DO: use your swipes at the Pav to get chick fil A on a meal swipe! Do also use plus dollars at the amazing food trucks (Indian, dumplings, mexican, and middle eastern - all incredible). DON'T eat the chicken at O'hill. * **How does the bus system work?** The buses are actually really really nice. There are many, many routes - too many to name here, but popular first year routes are the inner loop, the outer loop, the northline, and the trolley. You can download the Charlottesville area transit app and the rider app to see when/where the buses are running! *Pertaining to Admission/Transfer* * **I really want to go to UVA. Chance me.** Hey, really sorry, but we don't sit in the admissions office. None of us on reddit can give you a 100% chance. Not even u/uvadeanj, and she WORKS in the admissions office. Make sure your application is strong in academics and writing, and do what you're passionate about. Try your best on your SAT! Yes, we will happily share our own experiences with you if you want us to chance you, but we cannot guarantee what the outcome is! * **I want to transfer to UVA. Chance me.** Same as above. Classes vary from year to year in how many UVA can take and sometimes they can't take everyone, even if you are amazing and super qualified! Don't let that get you down and always try! Know you are always welcome here at UVA! * **I have a 1530, 1480, 1390, 1370, 1000, so on and so forth SAT and a 3.9, 3.8, 3.7, etc weighted/unweighted GPA. Will I get in?** Again, these are such variable measures we really can't assist you. What one person says got them in may have gotten someone else rejected. You are more than just a number and admissions recognizes that when they consider your app holistically. Obviously do the best you can do but know that GPA and SAT alone are not good litmus tests for admission! * **I got waitlisted/deferred/whatever they call it these days. What are my chances????** Again, this is a 'we don't know' question. Honestly, admissions probably doesn't know themselves. It depends on the pool of applicants, how many accepted folks take their spots, etc. I can only say don't be discouraged and don't let that deter you from accepting your spot should you be offered one at UVA! * **Where can I go to find more information about admission?** Here ya go: [https://admission.virginia.edu/](https://admission.virginia.edu/) [http://uvaapplication.blogspot.com/](http://uvaapplication.blogspot.com/) <---- this one is really helpful. Got me through my process. &#x200B; *Pertaining to the UVA community:* * **I'm an LGBTQ+ student and I am worried about fitting in here at UVA. Thoughts?** I personally am not an LGBTQ+ student, so anyone who is, fill in any gaps I leave out, but from what I've seen, the LGBTQ center is downright awesome (and brand new) and people are pretty supportive and accepting! UVA is top 10 in the nation for being LGBTQ+ friendly as well. Here's the article if you are interested! [https://news.virginia.edu/content/uva-ranked-7th-most-welcoming-school-lgbtq-students-nation](https://news.virginia.edu/content/uva-ranked-7th-most-welcoming-school-lgbtq-students-nation) * **I am a transfer student and am wondering how people feel about us.** Honestly, in my experience, people don't care. They're interested in knowing where you came from and are pretty friendly. I have quite a few friends who are transfer students and they mesh pretty well. I will say that your first semester will be hard as you find your place, especially as you don't have the benefit of a first-year RA or a first-year hall. Keep in mind you will have to go extra lengths to get involved but once you do you will find your place here. Nobody judges you for being a transfer student (in my experience) and I hope you find your home here! * **I am a conservative/liberal/moderate/libertarian/communist etc and I am worried about my political views being stifled at UVA.** There's both left and right here at UVA. UVA is a green light free speech campus ( [https://www.thefire.org/schools/university-of-virginia/](https://www.thefire.org/schools/university-of-virginia/) ) bound by the first amendment. Of course, that being said, you should always be ready to accept the consequences of what you say. There are many groups centered around politics and you will definitely find your party here! Lots of campaigning and party work goes on here and it's amazing to see how politically involved the students are. :) * **I've heard UVA is super elitist and preppy. Is this true? I'm worried I won't fit in!** There is always some truth to an accusation, I will be honest. That being said, while there can be some preppy culture, UVA is such a big school that you can surround yourself with folks to your liking. It's not something that has bothered me at all in my time here but to each their own. If this is a concern I would tour the Grounds first to see what you get the vibe of! * **What's the area around UVA like?** So UVA is unique that it is integrated into the city of Charlottesville. Unlike VT, where Blacksburg is literally VT, there is a charlottesville outside of UVA. There are pros and cons to it. You get amazing areas like the downtown mall and lots of conveniences like Walmart and many restaurants pretty close to you. However, there are some dangerous parts of charlottesville and you should be aware of them. Be safe, be smart, and make good decisions, and you should be fine. Remember there are resources for you! * **What's the Corner? What's there?** So the corner is our mini downtown area right off of Grounds. It's right by the medical center, and it's got so much amazing food there. There's the dumpling place, starbucks, grit, a CVS, Asado's, a few convenience stores, Christian's pizzas, a few student bars (Boylan, Trin, etc), and so much more. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED CORNER TRIES: Root's (holy sh\*t so good), Asado's, Bodo's bagels (incredible, cannot be in charlottesville without eating), and Take it away sandwich shop. * **What resources are there for me when it comes to mental health?** There's a lot that has been mentioned, but what comes to mind is CAPS and the Women's Center (you do not have to identify as a woman to use this resource). All confidential and free for student services. I have included the links below for your perusal! CAPS: [https://www.studenthealth.virginia.edu/caps](https://www.studenthealth.virginia.edu/caps) Women's Center: [https://womenscenter.virginia.edu/](https://womenscenter.virginia.edu/) * **How is Student Health?** Umm... It's okay. Good for a PCP but nothing spectacular (however, the doctors and nurses are always very nice and professional so please be nice to them). The medicine in the pharmacy is dirt cheap so it's really good to get your Rx's done here! * **What resources do I have to ensure my safety on Grounds?** Saferide is the best one. After a certain time, you can call for a free ride to take you home, even if you're drunk and alone. Here's the link: [https://parking.virginia.edu/saferide](https://parking.virginia.edu/saferide) . Similarly, there are other resources. Your RA will go into them. I have always felt Grounds have been safe(r), just because there are always students walking, even late a night. Buses run really late as well. &#x200B; *Pertaining to miscellaneous items:* * **How is the Wifi in dorms/Grounds? How can I connect my devices?** Wifi here is actually pretty good IMO. It's better than what I have at home. Connect to 'wahoo' the hidden network (instructions here: [https://virginia.service-now.com/its?id=itsweb\_kb\_article&sys\_id=ca13d12bdb8153404f32fb671d961969](https://virginia.service-now.com/its?id=itsweb_kb_article&sys_id=ca13d12bdb8153404f32fb671d961969) ) or connect to eduroam. Your orientation leaders and RA's will help you set up your wifi and make sure you are comfortable with all the networks UVA has to offer! * **Do we REALLY have to use all this stuffy lingo like 'Grounds' and 'first-year' and 'second-year'? All my VT friends call me extra!!** Yeah, you do. Thomas Jefferson said so, because learning is a lifelong experience. Sorry your VT friends are jealous they don't have this depth of tradition :( * **Are Days on the Lawn worth attending?** I personally didn't attend but I encourage anyone who is even remotely considering UVA to go. It's a great experience, you get to shadow classes and see the energy and spirit that really defines UVA. If you can't go, at least try to get a tour or do a virtual tour. Believe me, it's worth every minute and really defined why I wanted to go to UVA. That's my two cents. * **Should I listen to my orientation leader when they say don't take biology and chemistry together in one semester?** Yeah, no. As somebody who has lived this personally, and have had residents and friends live this personally, DO NOT heed this advice. You do not want to pair biology and organic chemistry in your second year because it's not a pleasant experience. For some, splitting it may be better, but for the vast majority, all it does is either a. put you behind by forcing you to take orgo in your 3rd year and make you take biochem in your fourth if you're pre-med, or b. make you take a crushing year of double bio and orgo. I did it for one semester, and it was bum. Don't do it. Toughing it out first year is a much better option, I promise! * **Are UVA the National Champions back-to-back, two years in a row, for 2019 AND 2020, in men's basketball?** Yes. If you keep asking silly questions like this we might have to rescind your admission! /s &#x200B; This write-up took me two weeks to complete. Again, much is opinion-based. Mods, if you find this helpful, I would appreciate a pin so that first-years can easily find it. Thanks for reading and happy trails, 'hoos!

I sincerely tried to make this as comprehensive as possible. Please, please. If I said something wrong, or missed something, add it here. This is a community effort.

This is impressive, can't wait for people to ignore it in a week. Mods, please pin this, I'm tired of seeing the same questions over and over again

Mods, any chance we could pin this for say the next 2-3 months?

Holy moly, you really put a lot of time and knowledge in here. Thank you!

This helped so much, I’m pretty excited to go now, thanks!

re: majors you have to apply to — a bit of the competitiveness is self-selection. People think they wont get in so they don’t even try. Go ahead and apply! And if you’re worried about a borderline GPA or anything else, go talk to the head of the program, it’s what they’re there for. (I was HBio)

As a 4th year, reading this made me really sad. I miss being excited to go to UVA for the first time :(

This is such a wonderful resource! What a gift you've given the new Hoos, u/rain6304. Would you all mind if I shared this on Instagram?

Okay but actually how do we apply to get this pinned. not sure if there's a process.

This is awesome and answered so many of my questions! As far as applying for Mcintire goes, do I have to be an Econ major to apply? As long as I have the prereq's I can still apply/ be an eligible candidate? Thanks again.

Does anyone know if it's possible/practical to double major between the college of arts and sciences and engineering? I was accepted as an electrical engineering major but am also interested in physics or astronomy.

Is there like a personality/preference spreadsheet for finding roommates? I know there's one among the girls but I'm not sure if there is one for guys (And I'd rather not post in the FB group haha)

i have a question about residential colleges. are they like an entire building or just floors of a building? and if we can’t choose our dorms then how will we apply for them?

Thank you so much for gathering all of this information together!! Do you know how to ensure you’re getting everything done in time (payments, rooming, etc.)? Especially during this time, I worry that I’m not going to fill out some kind of form that I missed and suddenly have a ton of issues with attending.

hi! This was such a great post thanks so much! A couple questions though— I found out that UVA has a medical scribe program, how competitive is it to become a part of that? And do you have any tips for anyone considering being an RA?

I got Cauthen in the Alderman hall. I heard it’s the smallest out the other houses in Alderman. Has anyone stayed there and is it good?

What words of advice do you have for students who are 1) quiet/introverted, 2) extraordinarily bright, and 3) committed to not partying/drinking? How should students like that go about finding friends and enjoying the college experience?

How hard is it to get into McIntire?

When is RD released for this year?

What are the chance of getting in McIntire? I read that the school is fantastic but I wonder how a student in McIntire feels about the school..

Roommate question! Once you do find a roommate, how do you request the same dorm as them? Is there a signup sheet in our UVA portal or..? And are dorms usually 2 people, or does it depend on what you're randomly assigned to?

Man, CAPS is garbage. They thought I was an out of state student lmfao when every address I gave them was clearly a Virginia one. Don’t leave your expensive things out and unattended for a long period of time because you think “honor” will protect you. Trusting thousands of people you don’t know is silly. And hot take but I don’t get why some people think UVA is special because of honor or whatever. People here probably don’t steal very often because this school is full of well off people and it’s not wise to steal something in full view of other people. UVA is very white and preppy. I have always thought this school has a problem with diversity and is pretty tone deaf when it comes to handling things involving minority groups and multiculturalism. If you don’t care about that then whatever, but it’s something to be aware of, especially if you’re not UVA’s typical admit. People reading this considering going to UVA should visit and check out the vibe of the school. You might find you like it or that “southern and historic” are just code words for plantation and slavery, as I have. Sure, you don’t need to be a partier to have fun every once in a while but let’s not pretend that bars and frats aren’t what the majority of what people do here. Most people here are partiers and participate in an absolutely massive drinking culture, if you’re not a fan of those things you’re in the minority. The gyms here suck for weightlifting, but they’re good for swimming, racquetball, basketball, and a bunch of other stuff. UVA professors I have found tend to be way, way better in the college than they are in the E-school. It makes sense, UVA is top tier for those liberal arts kind of things but pretty mediocre for the hard sciences, generally speaking. Some people on this subreddit will disagree with me because they believe “anyone can find their niche/group” and “anyone can be happy here” but I simply don’t believe that to be true. My personal advice to anyone starting at UVA and finding they’re unhappy is if you’ve gotten through your first semester and you still don’t like it, aren’t vibing with the school, find you don’t fit here etc. then begin thinking about transfer apps and looking to other schools. From that point on try and make things better for yourself but if you’re hating it still after 2 semesters here, well now you’ve got some options hopefully.

whats the best dorm

Wow this is such a good post I never even made it to the end

Thank you for this post! I’m cs engineering class of 24 and am pretty intimidated about research. Do I need to take any classes before delving into them?

I have a question about computers (maybe I should do a main post lol just let me know): is it really necessary to have the “recommended” 512gb SSD and the 16GB memory according to the laptop requirements, or is the min 265gb SSD and 8gb memory enough? I’m getting a new Macbook for school but it’s already expensive without the upgrades....

I'm an incoming freshman. Are there any ice rinks nearby open for public skating?

I'm having trouble deciding between UCLA and UVA. Would you say that UVA have better opportunities for research and grad schools? I'm considering doing Pre-med.

Are there any updates from UVa on whether the school will open for in-person instruction this fall? I have a couple friends I was hoping to visit this fall.

Hey, I’m a transfer student coming into uva next year and I was debating between applying for either Bond apartment or Brown residential college. I would probably have to do random roommate search, so what might be the best option do you guys think? And what’s the main differences between the two?

Hi! I plan on applying to UVA next year and was wondering if I take cc courses at NVCC over the summer, how difficult would it be for the credits to transfer over? Or will it depend on this course?

How would I go about getting a double major in Business (I am going into the school of engineering for computer science)?

I want to take NOVA (community college) classes during the summer to get some classes out of the way. How do I figure out which classes/credits I need to take and if they're offered at NOVA to take/transfer? I am in the college of engineering pursuing computer science

What is the political climate at UVA? I am from New York and was wondering if it will be an adjustment?

I’m in the e school for CS and I was just wondering if there are any really hard weed-out classes (cs or engineering prereqs) that I should look out for or try to avoid?

Any tips, pros, cons, etc for Dillard people

>**Do we REALLY have to use all this stuffy lingo like 'Grounds' and 'first-year' and 'second-year'? All my VT friends call me extra!!** > >Yeah, you do. Thomas Jefferson said so, because learning is a lifelong experience. Sorry your VT friends are jealous they don't have this depth of tradition :( I'm going to have to disagree with this one. I actually transferred here from Virginia Tech this semester and I still can't bring myself to call myself a "second year" or call the place "grounds". Maybe it's because missed that initial enchantment period that people have when entering new places and are the most receptive to things like tradition. I am generally ambivalent to school traditions that force me to change my vocabulary from everyone else.

I like McDonald’s

If wanted to be, say, a surgeon in the future, would I apply for the kinesiology program? This confuses me

Helps a lot! Thank you!

has anyone who got in ed for class of 26 got their actual letter yet? I got in but I haven’t gotten anything in the mail yet

Does UVA have a pre-med undergraduate major? Can you give me an overview of how it works/how to apply as someone looking to apply as a first-year?

If you go to UVA for undergraduate, what are your chances of getting into their medical school?

I was admitted for biology in the school of arts and sciences as part of the early decision pool, but now I am realizing I want to do biomedical engineering as part of the engineering school. Is there any way I can transfer to the school of engineering before my freshman year starts?

A LEGO Rotunda I built

Very good build.

Everything is AWESOME!

This is awesome. Directions available somewhere?

This is amazing and you need to post it to a sub where you’ll get the amount of (useless and valueless) internet points it deserves.

What a masterpiece! I love that you even included the statue!

Jefferson looks great

It is so beautiful, I almost shed a tear.

That's honestly awesome, it's giving me inspiration to do something similar! But for realism, you need a few streakers running down the steps... /s

That’s impressive

This is amazing! The camera angle is also great!

Needs a LEGO Cav-Man

Not yet, but maybe soon! I’ll let you know if I put something together.

Please please please do directions and a brick list! I would LOVE to surprise my son with a set for Christmas! 💗💗💗

Thanks, Dad.

this is so cool. I feel like you could somehow sell this... like the instructions for it, or bundle all the pieces and let me figure it out. Either way, I know I'd buy it!

Yep. Alumnus. Have a 2 year old.

Would love this as well! I’ve tried and failed several times to make this. Probably good I was in the college and not the A School.

Good thing I’m in the A school and not the college then lol

UVA students and VT students have one thing in common . . .

The only valid reason😌

Funnily enough, I actually got rejected from tech

They both didn’t go to JMU?

They both applied to UVA.

Lol did u forget to send in ur stuff?

They both got into VT! But “they both got into JMU” also works

Nope, granted I did apply for engineering, which I’ve heard is relatively competitive there. But still very grateful to get to go to UVA

Not all of us! I was too lazy to apply to VT because they aren't common app anymore and I didn't want to write more essays after all the shit UVA required.

VT waitlisted me, yet I got into UVA...

Lol. Sorry, I’m an old alum... Now i get it

A very sincere fuck you to everyone partying at midsummers. Y'all some idiots. from a local healthcare worker

If people keep acting like that we can bet if fall isn’t canceled and put online outright that we will be sent home in a month after returning. Smh we’re supposed to be some of America’s best students and this is what we do?

I'm fully expecting we're gonna be sent home well ahead of Thanksgiving because this shit is absolutely not gonna stop unless the COVID plan the university's got going gets some very large and pointy teeth

I mean, the fact that bars and frats are open at all is really incompatible with returning to school. Returning to school is risk enough without adding the risk of people gathering at bars and restaurants. This is true for K-12 as well. I think all bars restaurants need to be shut down for schools to happen, or at least more draconian measures like preventing students from going there and having cops start to fine people at large private gatherings.

Y’all are either dumb as fuck or selfish as fuck. I wouldn’t be surprised if everything were online in the fall

Am going fully online because of the higher likelihood of a 2nd outbreak. Fuck y’all.

Alumni are not exempt, I've seen so many snap stories/instagram stories of friends that have been partying it up for over a month now, not a mask in sight save for one selfie of them pretending to care. I thought we were better than this, but apparently the need to get wasted is still stronger than anything for these jerks. I am heavily considering removing all of these people thanks to their blatant disregard for everyone around them.

The only way to prevent this is full stop martial law. It isn't just privileged, entitled students gathering. Go to any campsites in western VA and they're overrun by groups of rednecks taking no steps whatsoever to mask or distance. As it stands, VDH has no power to enforce mask wearing on private property and the state has permitted gatherings of up to 250, so the cops can't do anything about it.

Assuming we get to return at all. I doubt the university has the resources or balls to enforce social distancing guidelines, and they have to know that many if not most students just aren’t responsible enough to police themselves. Look out for an email telling us everything will be online

At the very least they need to ban anyone who violates the rules (wearing masks, not having large gatherings, etc.) from grounds until the pandemic is over/ those restrictions are lifted, so probably at least for this academic year.

To this point, there is currently a gathering of 100 or so kids and parents at a local baseball field in the western part of Albemarle county, not a mask in sight.

You think that college students will choose to wear face shields while partying?? I'm not sure you know college students very well.

it isn't fucking ok because they are literal public health threat. By not showing concern for the virus they are not showing concern for vulnerable populations or for healthcare workers. I feel my anger is valid and useful here. We should have a good crack at shaming these people into behaving safely. Shame doesn't put you on a vent.

I understand where you’re coming from but I disagree. They very well knew the risks (unless they’re living under a rock) so in my opinion they were being intentionally malicious since they intentionally chose to party with a bunch of strangers during a global pandemic.

No, it is not unrealistic to expect people to stay home from parties. We live in a very unique time in world history- one where you can be locked up in your house and still stay connected to all your friends save for physical contact, courtesy of the Internet. What kind of weak-willed selfish cowards can’t put people’s lives over their own fun? People are DYING not because of some unpreventable force. It is sheer stupidity and incompetence to the point of malice. This sort of half-measure rely-on-the-goodness-of-people “encouragement” approach is what got us to three million and more cases. People across America have proven that they cannot be trusted to do the right thing, including much of UVA’s student body. To ignore this fact is burying your head in the sand of the highest order.

While I don't agree students should be partying rn, it is true that there will continue to be parties. The suggestions follow harm reduction theory (from what I've heard about it). But yeah, since they weren't following guidelines, there should be some sort of punshiment

Everyone bashing you in the comments is too blinded by anger to see the reason in your points. You’re not saying this is behavior to encourage or to just get over. You’re comment is the only realist comment I see. These kids are 18-23, privileged upbringing, and craving social interaction. It’s downright naive to assume everyone will follow social distancing guidelines, especially for those who haven’t seen covid up close enough to know its dangers.

Honestly I would fully support that

Not against the idea but how do you propose to enforce that?

It’s not his points that are wrong. It’s the implication behind them. He’s saying it is unrealistic to expect young people not to go to parties for their college experience. This has been proven correct by midsummers. The flaws in his logic start by suggesting that because there is no ‘malice’ in their actions, we should refrain from disciplinary penalties and action, instead opting for a more kind, encouraging approach. He seems to forget that PEOPLE ARE DYING. THE MORE THIS VIRUS SPREADS, THE MORE THEY WILL DIE. Attending a party, knowing the stakes for your community, is action not far short of manslaughter. Kindness and encouragement are actions we do not have the luxury of because we have been trying that ever since the virus reached the United States and we are at three million cases. People are stupid in a group and these sorts of things must be cracked down on.

I've got a potential solution. Don't go to fucking frat party during a pandemic. This is no great sacrifice or too great an expectation, even for these privileged adolescents.

They knew that their actions could potentially get someone sick or possibly kill someone. There’s a very clear divide there because risky behavior and complete disregard for other people

I’m not arguing that we shouldn’t enact a policy with sharper teeth. I’m just agreeing that it’s naive to expect a policy without teeth to work, especially with uva kids who’ve never been told no.

Bro Sigma Pi or Die

That’s not a real position. To say you support “whatever works” and then to implicitly or explicitly endorse the actions of people which directly make the situation worse in the name of being understanding, i.e. stuff that does not work, is a logically invalid stance to take. If it helps, think of it as a argument between parent and child. You, as a parent, would not allow your child to eat a full tub of ice cream for dinner. You should explain to your child why you are not allowing them to do so- for their health- but if they still refuse to see reason, you do not then allow them to eat the ice cream anyway in the name of keeping the peace and being a ‘understanding parent’. I think this is a particularly good analogy for these times seeing as how many people going to these parties have been acting like spoiled children! And yes, you’re definitely going to be seen as the ‘bad guy’ for taking that stance, probably because people just like to jump on the downvote bandwagon. Who cares about em? Don’t retreat from a discussion that you believe in just because people don’t like it!

There isn’t a ‘balance’ with personal freedoms. Freedoms and rights extend only so far as to not infringe upon those of others. Your right to free assembly, for example, only applies when your assembly doesn’t actively impede others’ right to assemble. It’s why protestors are allowed to form a picket line outside a place of work, at least on public property, but are not allowed to actively harass and beat scabs from crossing it and entering to do their job. Assembling at a party like these frats have allowed? Sure, they do have the ‘freedom’ to do it, but by allowing these parties to take place and perpetuating the spread of the virus, they pose a clear and present threat to the health and well-being of the community, especially more senior members. By exercising their freedom to do what they want on private property, they are actively infringing upon others’ rights to, you know, not die or become critically sick based on the selfishness of a low-risk population- actions of a group they have no control over. The actions of the frats and the party attendees are not actions of good people with good moral character. Because their actions cause the virus to spread, destroying lives and hurting people, they are morally wrong, and to a much worse degree than, say, choosing to cheat on a homework assignment. People who endanger other people, whether through negligence or malice, should be outed and punished.

Lavel-Devin-D'Sean

I cried for several minutes the night this happened, but I've been relatively ok otherwise. I'll be going about my day, not thinking about the shooting, and then I'll remember "Oh, right. That horrific thing happened right here, on university grounds" and feel...weird about it? Not really sure why my brain does that, but I have that jarring feeling a few times throughout the day.

I took this picture because this is Phi Kappa Psi, one of many houses that try and express the grief that our community feels today. Be kind to each other edited as not to offend

Why did you feel it was necessary to include a retracted article in this post? Edit: for those wondering what I am referring to. The original comment linked a Wikipedia page about the phi psi rolling stone article

Yeah I guess maybe my brain hasn't fully processed my emotions about it yet, which might explain why I just feel off or "weird." My partner lives in northern Virginia, and when I asked if he felt any differently about this shooting compared to other shootings, he said he felt the same, but this definitely hit me different. I walked through Culbreth to get to my intramural volleyball games earlier this semester, and now those memories just seem like a different time entirely. A more innocent time, I guess? It still feels hard to believe that this really happened sometimes. I will say that as a psychology researcher, there is literature showing that writing about feelings or talking out loud (to a person or even just to yourself) helps people process negative emotions better than thinking quietly. Just writing this comment out helped me recognize something new about how I feel about the situation.

The reference is a hyperlink, you don't have to click on it.

I understand but as I walked around that small area I thought of all that has happened in those few blocks from August 11th 2017 to now and it's a lot- a whole lot. All of it national news. I drove by all the news trucks on Culbreth on my way home last night and wanted to get out of my car and scream "get the fuck out of here". The only thing that stopped me was the knowledge that they would be gone in the morning. Moving on to the next senseless tragedy without remorse or feeling. It was so quiet early this morning and there was a small bunch of flowers near where the bus had been with small flicking electric tea lights. Except for that; it was like nothing had happened. I don't know what any of it means today and if I've offended anyone that was not my intent.

Greetings from way behind enemy lines down here in Blacksburg. It... it gets better. I promise. 2007 was hard here and the national media were like vultures. Even after Virginia Tech largely chased them off campus they were still there, just with long lenses -- a constant reminder that our community's grief was a commodity for public consumption. Hug someone you love, buy a stranger a cup of coffee, and just try to get through today. Tomorrow will take care of itself. And know that, scattered across the Commonwealth and the country, thousands mourn with you.

As a former brother at Phi Psi at Virginia, this current image represents who we are. We are UVA Strong. I hope you all find peace and support one another.

New York Times columnist and UVA alumnus Jamelle Bouie: "If Ken Cuccinelli is appointed president of UVA all hell will break loose here."

He’s coming. They’ll rush it, to get him seated before the general election. And they’ll use the Provost vacancy as an excuse. “We couldn’t do a national search and leave both positions unfilled for that long.” See what the utterly unqualified Ben Sasse did to the university of Florida. That’s our future.

If so...Loudspeakers on Carr's Hill, 24-7. Reggae dub, maybe Prince Far-I, midnight to 6 am. A-School will be down...

That’ll be it for me. I’m out.

That would change the university's academic reputation pretty quickly. (Cucci, not hell breaking loose.)

Is there any indication Cuccinelli would be considered for it? I know he's being added to the board, but are there real rumors he might be put up for the president position?

There will be riots if cuccinelli is appointed. And that may be just what trump wants. Gives him a pretext to be a fascist with an iron fist. Familiar playbook- do something outrageous and let the other side’s reactions play into your hands.

If I’ve got something wrong here please tell me: assuming Spanberger wins, isn’t there a decent chance the BoV is overhauled and a new president is appointed to replace him in 10 months? Like again, I may have something wrong.

Wildly enough this was exactly was I told someone is likely to happen once I saw the announcement. Got kicked out of the BOV so this is to get him back to uVa.

He's not wrong.

UF Gator here. Definitely feel for yall. We have some similar issues at our university regarding the presidential situation. Wish politics wasn’t so intertwined with collegiate governance.

Hoping for Ken or George Allen?

Maybe we'll get Jerry Jr.

Lol didn't the last guy resign to save people's jobs? They are all about to get fired anyway

Cuccinelli is a fucking menace.

And that’s why the ‘I did this to save funding and help students’ makes no sense (in the resignation letter). Never comply in advance. Maybe in the short term they would lose some funding (and lawsuits would be filed). But they did this now so Gov could select before election. What the Trump new Pres does will be far worse for students and the university in the long run. They will not stop until it’s a right wing white bro factory. Just completely infuriating - he needed to fight! (But I’m not the least bit surprised given how protestors were treated, how they caved in advance on trans care and got rid of DEI positions). Made it all way too easy. Heck they could have even had an election issue about unprecedented interference of feds in higher Ed. Just sad for everyone all around.

I was hoping my 17-year-old son would apply to UVA but now I’m going to hold off and see what happens

President Cooch yeahhh 🤙

Kookinelli couldn't pass the Va bar in his first attempt

All heil will break loose!

Ah, the two-way street of diversity of thought.

Ken would have made a great governor and will make a great UVA president

They’ll get him seated before school starts again

Good riddance ❤️

He’s not being added to the board, the State Legislature rejected his appointment

Have you paid attention to anything that Youngkin and this BOV have been doing? There is *every* indication that he will be considered.

Trump hates Cuccinelli. Don’t think this’ll happen.

But so what? Let them come… Censoring yourself in the face of growing fascism doesn’t work.

Trump doesn’t need a pretext to be a Fascist and he doesn’t think that far ahead. He’s not planning on resistance; in his mind responding with force is deescalation through fear. In his mind, sending in the Marines and the NG to LA was supposed to cow people into submission rather than grow opposition as it did. I can guarantee you that he would open fire into a crowd of protesters because he genuinely believes that would make them stop. I know because he tried to order that in his first term, and the smarter people around him refused. The reason the US Military itself argues against opening fire on protesters is because, more often than not, protesters will eventually just go home if you let them protest. If you start killing them, protests turn into something far worse and far harder to deal with.

Assuming the outcome of an election is never safe, particularly in Virginia. And even if it was only 10 months, that is plenty of time for a lot of chaos and damage. Idk, I also don't want to be alarmist about this either, particularly given that the President Ken stuff does feel purely hypothetical at this point. But in all likelihood whoever gets hired will align with the BoV more closely than Ryan, and so folks aren't just crying wolf either.

I can't imagine Spanberger doing anything that might "alienate swing voters", i'd be less suprised if she were to appoint Cuccinelli herself than fire the entire board of visitors

If Spanberger wins, she would not have until summer 2027 until even half the BOV are her appointees. The state Senate has the approve the BOV appointees, but not the President it choices.

He lives in Charlottesville

You made a brand new account just to say this?

And the BOV can appoint him.

I missed that. Thanks!

I don't think firing the board of visitors will swing the election one way or another. 90% of virginia voters don't even know what that is.

She has the authority to fire any BOV member for cause at any time. Youngkin just fired a BOV a couple of months ago.

True, there’s nothing stopping them from making him president aside from the insane backlash they would receive, I was just clarifying he’s not being put on the BOV

I didn't say it was logical but that's how center-right democrats think

christ, what "backlash" would those fucks receive that they would care the slightest about?

Didn’t stop them from listing him on the website: https://bov.virginia.edu/people/honorable-kenneth-t-cuccinelli-ii

He's on the board of Visitors because appointees serve until their confirmation and the BOV is being sued by the state Senate to stop his illegal service.

According to the Sabre (UVA's sports message full of mostly older white conservative men), as conservative and Republican as the BOV is, they're not trying to destroy UVA, run off faculty and appoint someone like Cuccinelli. I hope that's true, but we'll see.

The backlash coming in January 2026 when Gov. Spanberger fires all of their sorry asses.

I mean they’ve restrained themselves from firing Jim Ryan even though they’ve wanted to forever until Bert could contact Daddy Trump to give them a good enough excuse to force Ryan’s hand, so they probably care a little bit, but I doubt it would stop them if that’s who they wanted.

"honorable" lol

will she, though.

She will not

“Grades must be posted 48 hours after the final examination”

To be fair, grading final exams, especially non-multiple choice questions, is a very time consuming task

Faculty here: I don't know any of my colleagues who are procrastinating on purpose. Fact is, this has been a super stressful semester for all of us, students and faculty alike. Teaching a full semester online, often with groups of students you never met in person, and juggling various students' tech needs (gotta remember which students can participate how in breakout rooms because student A is abroad and their VPN isn't working today (so no access to email, google docs, ...), student B has no audio, student C's connection keeps cutting out, etc.). Teaching during the election was especially disheartening because you could see how your students were struggling, but there's only so much you can do from a distance. We all get screen fatigue, so after a couple of hours teaching (5 days a week, plus meetings, advising sessions, the zillionth faculty development webinar, ...), grading can move down a couple of spots on your to-do list. Especially since for those of us who are used to grading on paper (especially if it means getting all of the papers at the same time after a test), figuring out how to do this efficiently online and in a way that is easy for students, too, can take significantly longer. So sometimes, you simply need to take a day or two to give your mental health a break and return to getting work done with a fresh(er) mind (I'd give the exact same advice to my students, too!). I really tried to be much more accommodating than usual this semester with deadline extensions, allowing students to resubmit assignments well after the deadline because their email attachments couldn't be opened, included only the exam prompt, or had attachments missing entirely, etc., and all I can hope is that my students will grant me the same leniency in turn. So yes, especially in this semester, grading may take a little bit longer, but at least personally, I believe that my students will benefit more if I can pay full attention to their assignments and offer them constructive feedback and compassion in this semester, which is much easier to do if I actually caught up on some sleep or basic self-care needs first. So yes, we see you struggling, but we hope you can see that we are in the same boat :-) And yes, I understand this is a meme and just trying to be funny, but please remember to be kind to your fellow humans! (And if you ever want to make your prof/TA's day, send them a thank-you email - they can mean such a great deal!) Much love, and please do take care of yourself/yourselves, too. You are all such amazing young people, and you deserve to rest and be happy, too. You ~~may~~ will probably forget the minutiae you learnt in a specific required class, but the person you're growing into and the self-care habits you pick up now will stay with you forever! Keep thriving and remember, less is often more, Prof C. (who submitted all her grades on Tuesday ;-))

Me, the child of two professors, watching them feverishly grading and staying up to odd hours of the night to get grades done as quickly as possible....

This. 3 of my classes had multiple choice finals for which we got our grades for immediately. None of the professors have given out final grades yet though and I just want to know my grade

Have they always had this 48hr thing for finals? I feel like that's unrealistic for a lot of classes.

I took a final the Tuesday before Thanksgiving and I haven’t heard anything since then.

I doubt my final exam can even be graded in 48 hours... Considering how it takes over a week to grade a small quiz...

I know one professor that had to quarantine the projects for a week, because she couldn't confirm who turned what in when.

Sounds like they are referencing the final examination in general. So by Monday.

Hahaha I know, it’s primarily a joke. I will add that some of us had final exams, projects or assignments completed before Thanksgiving, so you would think we would at least have the grades back for those by now

Yeah, I think OP just meant to make a joke. All of my exams that weren't multiple choice are taking a while to be graded. And some professors gave us autograded parts in classes that shouldn't be all autograded to have grades in on time. Really the policy is at the fault of the University. Students and professors are just trying to keep up Edit: grammar

Yeah, it's been this way since "forever" (at least since I started teaching 10ish years ago). Fortunately, they don't really care, as long as you submit your grades by the final deadline. It really sucks if you get an exam slot on the very last day though (which I managed to get a few semesters in a row). Then you basically need to grade everything within a day or two. If your exam includes essay questions and you don't have a TA, that makes for a fun weekend...

oh no i got they were trying to make a joke i just also didn’t want the insanity faced by professors with the timeframe they’re given for final grades to be overlooked

WARNING: RESIDENT ADVISOR IS NOT WORTH IT I’m an incoming RA for next year. I’ve seen so many of my friends apply to “save lots of money.” UVA took away all of my financial aid because of my “exceptional RA benefits.” I’m essentially paying the same amount I paid last year but working a job. I was told by UVA that being an RA was not about the financial benefits, but being able to work with the students and build a community. No offense, but I’m not going on call and coverage and all this for free just to meet new students. Like all the other RAs, I’m doing it as a job. UVA played me good 😭😭 now I’m doing free labor for them. Just a warning to everyone who thinks RA is THE financial goal.

wut if i alr had zero aid

Past ra here. If you are receiving financial aid, uva will take away your financial aid in lieu of the housing and dining (around 13k) that the RA position “covers.” If you aren’t receiving aid then it doesn’t make a difference, but to those who are it doesn’t make sense to become an ra. It’s stupid since it only allows for those who can afford it to be an ra which doesn’t allow for as diverse of an ra class based on income to actually serve uva students

So RAs don't get free housing? I thought that was the one benefit.

This should have been explained to you more clearly.

Is it too late to withdraw as an RA?

I remember how they docked my aid for getting $60/month for working at the CD. (Basically, beer money.) The financial aid folks are ruthless when you try to do anything that would make it easier to afford going there. (BTW, beer was one of those things.)

I went to a different public university in VA for undergrad and they had the same policy. I chose not to be an RA after hearing friends have this experience Is it too late to get your aid back by resigning?

Past RA here and I gotta tell u it was hell! First of all, I somehow got assigned boys and girls and the boys were so rowdy and such a-holes. I literally cried. Between acting like a parent to children and going to dean bc u caught someone drinking in their room underage, it consumed so much time for literally zero reward. Back then, they gave u a small budget and u had to come up w a minimum amount of social events and it sucked. If I have any advice, don’t do it, it was by far the worst experience of my time at uva. Like OP said, the financial incentive seems attractive, but it’s def not worth the price

This seems very on-point for UVA. The professional schools aren't any nicer, I feel like my entire enrollment was a bait and switch.

at least it looks good on a resume! yeah the role is not great, financially, for those in your position. but it's also not *that* time-consuming or stressful most of the time, so your year may end up going better than you expect. as a current RA: just do your best, try to enjoy it (because it is quite fun much of the time), and recognize, when making your decision for future years, what the costs and benefits are.

Wow that’s crazy they took away your aid. VCU not only gave me free housing, but a $1000 stipend each semester. Only downside was we had to buy a meal plan. Still, could have been worse. And they definitely didn’t touch my financial aid!

bruh. are we serious. But what about being a third and fourth year, does it work out? Because you get guaranteed housing that’s cheaper than the money you get back that can’t afford an apartment in Charlottesville?

Did it take away grant money or loan money? If it took away loan money then it's worth it.

past ra here - hrl does not care to make anyone’s life easier! i’ve seen this scenario play out for so many at this point :(

That is utterly unreasonable, is there any kind of appeal process? Sounds like the kind of thing a law school clinic might take up, I graduated from the law school 20+ years ago so my memory may be fuzzy but I believe there was a pro bono clinic to help undergrads with various university-related issues, it might be limited to honor committee stuff or it might be gone entirely but it seems like it would be worth looking into. Or even Legal Aid if you qualify.

If a person has high need here, I don't see what they would even want or need to apply to be an RA. Since UVA meets full need it makes sense that they would reduce aid if you're already high need. If you were at a Fed aid only school or fell in the middle to low need aid range, being an RA is advantageous.

This is how financial aid works in general - they look at your income and assets and determine what you can afford to pay. Just because you are working for the university it doesn’t change that. Like most parts of the financial aid process, while it benefits those genuinely in need - it unfairly “punishes” those who are fiscally responsible (who have saved well, don’t spend beyond their means, have a steady job, other income). Someone whose parents spent all their money on cars, vacations , houses for example will get more aid than someone whose parents sacrificed that to put money in a 529.

Got the first of many real world lessons. Biz don’t give a f**k about you. The sooner you lock that in the better off and more successful you will be

In my day, being an RA was strictly a politico move. A required stop en route to a lawn room.

Maybe it depends on the school. My kid did their undergrad at Alabama, and had a Presidential Scholarship for tuition and fees, and years 2-4, worked as an RA. They ended up just paying for room and board year 1, and the cost for 2-4 was just minor expenses and books. Total cost for 4 years was less than 20k, and that allowed them to get their MS @ UVA and still have 50k of their 529 left over…so i’m in the process of converting 35k of that to a Roth IRA in their name, then gifting the rest to them. They’ll pay about 2k in capital gains, but they’ll get almost all of that for their own use.

lol everyone always shits on radford but when i was an RA i got full free room and board plus the meal plan and i was still able to get financial aid. being an ra only left me w like 14k debt it was totally worth it. and w the way the world is going going to a PaRtY ScHoOl was worth it

My RA just spent most nights at his girlfriend's apartment or his frat house. You're probably overestimating your responsibilities.

Uh, isn't this what's happening to lots of parents? They work more and make more and the schools just make them pay more? Lol. Now you know how it feels. This is why schools shouldn't price discriminate.

Sorry but I think it's crazy you didn't think free housing would affect your financial aid award.

If you got 0 aid it's worth it because they can't make you pay more lol. This was my case.

That’s fucking insane and it really influences the type of people likely to become RAs… I was an RA at William and Mary and received aid… I don’t think they took it away from me due to the exceptional benefits. Boo Hoo 👎

That’s such an important point. It really is a shame that they swap out the RA “coverage” for necessary aid. That really is benefits nobody. And yes, it would have a big impact on the diversity of the RA population. What a poor decision.

Past RA here, this!

They do, but they’ll take away the cost of the housing from your financial aid offer. So… not free housing in reality.

No definitely not, what are they going to do lol

This is a crazy response. Who cares how time consuming or fun it is, they deserve equal compensation for doing the same job

I called them and they said no. I fr got played so hard 😭😭

I don't know the legality of it, I'm sure it's legal. This is not the first time I've seen a post like this on here. People regularly post about this issue. If you wanted to get involved to help, I'd focus more on getting student gov to try and push UVA to not subtract from aid for RAs. UVA should also be doing a lot more to tell people who sign up for RAing, in the application, in info sessions, "WE DEDUCT FINANCIAL AID FROM RAs". Like I said, this post comes up every year. It's actually pretty surprising this STILL isn't made abundantly clear during the application process.

"I don't see why poorer people would want school to be more affordable, they already get soooo many handouts!"

I legit cannot believe people don't understand this. It's shocking.

If you downloaded this, why?

imagine going into 14k of debt for radford..

That just sounds like you had someone who didn’t do their job though. Doesn’t make it right. My RA was really involved and active - also had a boy/girl situation she had to manage and it was rough. She handled it well but if you’re actually doing your job and living amongst the students - there is work involved.

Saying “Work more and make more” just shows you haven’t encountered people who Bust Ass working low-income positions. And don’t pile on telling me they can go to school to get a better job when the jobs they’re working are already key infrastructure. If they move on, others will be needed to fill the high-need, low-pay positions. (Rant over) @tonyjambo hits the key issue IMO

The thing is, it’s not “free housing.” IM WORKING A JOB 😭😭 I’m PAYING for it with my labor. It would be free housing if I didn’t do anything for it.

It's free housing if you're rich and don't need financial aid, though.

If being an RA is "not about the financial benefits" then the "financial benefits" shouldn't impact your financial aid. They should have to pick a lane. Maybe they DON'T have to, but this is fishy.

I edited my comment... do try legal aid. It's totally possible there's just nothing to be done but I've been practicing law for quite a while and this "smells" like something where you should have some recourse if you're persistent, and I wouldn't necessarily just take the university's word for it being hopeless. (Among other things the university would be shooting itself in the foot by actively deterring people from being RAs by pulling the rug out from under them.)

I remember it being talked about during the info sessions and being encouraged to call SFS before applying to see how it might impact aid. Though if you just submit the application without attending any of that stuff it isn't really advertised.

I’m not sure what the RA application looks like, but I do know that there is an information session with a presentation specifically about the impact to financial aid.

I remember them skirting around it by telling students to contact SFS to see if their renumeration affects financial aid. They should probably make it clearer since, at least anecdotally, they seem to take aid away from everyone, but people could easily find this out by talking to their current RA.

Didn't say that. I actually said it's best to take the free money (I refuse to call it a hand out because it is not) and not have to work & still have housing & meal plan covered. Most people typically become RAs because they don't have enough grant money to cover housing and meal plan, so waiving those costs by being an RA is more attractive.

its paid off so... and i have a job w my degree stay mad

of course there are people that bust ass for low-income positions. there are also many families where the second spouse goes back to work to afford college, or where a parent takes a more difficult job for more pay or elects to work more overtime to afford college. the families then correspondingly lose aid, so it disincentivizes work. OP is just now finding out how benefits disincentivize productivity.

But you understand that this is how they treat parents whose kids get financial aid, right? Like, if the second spouse goes back to work and makes more money, they schools will give the family less aid, even though the spouse is "working a job". This is one of the big problems with financial aid. It disincentivizes labor and savings among large swaths of people. It's doing the same to you -- you're electing not to work in exchange for a payment (via free housing) because you'd be getting less in benefits.

And how long until they come for some of our UVA students? How long until it’s even citizens who are being detained?

Please get an immigration attorney & safe houses lined up for these students. Joe Katz on BlueSky is an activist with immigration & sanctuary city resources. https://bsky.app/profile/joekatz45.bsky.social There’s a link here to “Local Public-Facing Immigrant Support/Advocacy Groups” https://tr.ee/72SinzKeuE

It will be soon. Yougkin literally just wrote his intentions to add Ken Cuccinelli to the board to replace Ellis. From his Wikipedia: "Cuccinelli has been described as an immigration hard-liner He has supported President Trump's anti-immigration policies. While in Virginia politics, Cuccinelli pushed legislation to force employees to speak English in the workplace. He has sought to repeal birthright citizenship.He sought to ban undocumented immigrants from attending Virginia colleges." He also wrote a chapter for Project 2025. It seems clear people like Ryan won't or can't stop him.

The problem is that, when you deny due process to “non-citizens,” you deny due process to everyone. Because all the government has to do is decide you’re not a citizen, and you no longer have access to a hearing to prove otherwise.

Please keep students safe by any means! Request privately for professors to have remote options for classes, so they can move to a safer location!

With the Trump administration breaking the law daily, ignoring court orders, now with the ability to use anonymous thugs to disappear people...I don't think it will be long.

We are watching a fascist take over in real time. Definition of anti-semitism is being changed so it’s illegal to criticize Israel. The 5th Circuit in Texas went out of their way to make sure a state law banning government contract recipients from criticizing Israel was upheld. If you criticize Trump, Israel, Musk, etc. they will label you a national security threat and suspend your rights. They are moving quickly from undocumented to legal immigrants. Just preparing for citizens next. The TikTok Ban (thanks for that, Democrats) gives Trump the authority to ban any digital speech he doesn’t like on National Security grounds, and it’s already been held up unanimously by the Supreme Court. We are watching a federal administration discard federal law and the constitution on a daily basis. It’s only a matter of time before much weirder, more violent things start happening.

We have to gum up the gears, now and when they arrive.

Citizens have already been detained. Get in the fucking streets already!

Wonderful! Send them on their way…they hate our country and only want to undermine the institutions giving them opportunities.

If they violate your right to due process, they don't have to prove that you're a citizen or not, they just have to say you aren't. After that, good luck getting some Venezuelan guard to help you.

Richmond area here.

Wasn't she arrested for breaking into a building?

Fuck Donald trump

Not long at all.

Being pro-Palestine is not “antisemitism”. This idiot administration needs to look up the definition. It’s impossible to be antisemitic and support a Semitic people…

She’s literally had her visa revoked. Refusing to leave the country will become a punishable offense and she will be in more trouble lol.

Not soon enough. Bye.

do the crime do the time

If you followed a legal process of entry, then no worries.

People are being really dense by pretending Democrats have any backbone or moral compass to counter this fascist administration. When Biden was the president almost every university where student held protests and encampments police were called in, students were pepper sprayed, assaulted and arrested. Democrats won’t fix this, both parties are authoritarian.

If there are American citizens, they won't be deported. If they're illegal aliens, they're getting deported.

If I knew I would be potentially deported I would just stay far away from protests and mind my business.

It’s wild how most Hispanic and Asian American vote Republican and then want POC to feel bad for them when something backfires

Being Pro Terrorist is a pretty well known Zero Tolerance. It's time people wake up. This obviously is getting your attention.

If they broke our laws and are illegal they should be deported. It doesn't matter how long they have been here or if they are students.

UVA is quite strict on its students with anything interrupting campus, I don’t see this being a problem unless a UVA student is organizing elsewhere. Not a defense for any of this but is it a UVA problem? I’ll be optimistic and say probably not.

Is there a plan in place to flood their tip lines with false leads? If someone were to write some bots to fake her presence places, how much trouble do you think they’d get in?

President Ryan is not in charge of who the governor appoints to the Board of Visitors. The way to have prevented this was to have gotten Terry McAuliffe elected three years ago

The Constitution also specifically does not use the word “citizen”. Some rights are enumerated, some are actually restrictions on the government. Exceedingly few of them are exclusive to citizens. Even during the Cold War the Supreme Court stood up for the rights of Americans to read Communist propaganda, read whatever they want, and specifically protected political speech. Since 9-11 it’s just been dangerous national security loophole after loophole. I truly believe our Constitution is broken and that it will not be fixed until new unions of states are formed.

bingo! (thanks for making this point so succinctly.)

Ice will get them one way or the other because ice will get them a graduation or when they apply for a job.

They're criminals.

The move to citizens will be an easy one if they win the birthright citizenship case. Even if they only deny citizenship from relatively small classes of people, the effects will be on all of us. If they ban birthright citizenship from children of tourists or students, for example, these people have birth certificates. How do YOU prove your citizenship currently? You show your birth certificate. Pretty clear. Well what happens when they say, yeah ok you have a birth certificate, and, sorry for this, but, you now need to prove your parents were citizens when you were born, or at least that your parents were green card holders when you were born. Go get that information, otherwise we can't verify your status. Ok so then you need to track down the birth certificates of your parents. Most states won't give them to you unless your parents are dead. They don't want any identity theft. So now you need to beg your parents for a copy of their birth certificate. If your parents know you don't support them politically, maybe they won't give you a copy. Oops. Even if your parents are dead, you now need to go to possibly two more states to track down those birth certificates. And you will probably need death certificates to first prove your parents actually died. Whew, that's a lot of work. And odds are you will have to do this through the mail, because you can't travel to these states. You just don't have time. But if everyone is trying to do this, there might be quite the backlog. You could wait months. Ok but what if your parents weren't born here? Now you need to track down your parents visa information. That should be fun. Your problems here will be similar. The federal government likely won't give it to you if your parents are alive, so you either need to prove they're dead or ask your parents to help. Better hope you are all on good terms. I'm sure the federal government will be much quicker at these records requests now that they plan to fire 50% of all agency staff. They should be super quick, right? Oh, whats that? You got accused of a crime while waiting, and got arrested? Well, they can't verify your citizenship because you didn't get the documents yet, so, you will just have to wait in jail I guess. Or worse. Tough break kiddo. Maybe you're not a citizen after all.

Not a single citizen has been deported. Detained =/= deported.

I don't know. You tell me.

Did you even read the title? She’s a permanent resident, not a Visa holder. And nothing got revoked.

I completely agree, what crime has she committed? A legal resident participating in a non-violent demonstration?

Did you miss the part where it says she's a legal resident?

Perhaps you have missed the news where they are snatching people with student visas off the streets.

yes, voting for Jill Stein was clearly the only choice you had

just a fucking WILD thing to say about the first amendment

I have no idea, I’m not informed on this stuff or the safety of doing so - please be careful if you do this & don’t draw any extra attention to these students

"How much trouble do you think they'd get in?" A lot.

Please do not do that. It’s an admirable idea but it is illegal and you just posted about it on social media.

Joe Katz might be a good person to ask (via signal?) https://tr.ee/72SinzKeuE

I realize that, but he is in the best position to counter their destructive measures. So far, he hasn't given much confidence that he knows how to stop a bov member from helping ICE detain a student for writing something critical of Israel, for example.

“RIP to Lavel Davis, Devin Chandler, & D'Sean Perry ...... Thoughts and pravers to the UVA team and community, absolute tragedy for the families of these 3 young men.” -Coach Rahn

Rest in peace, 3 Beautiful and brilliant young souls gone too soon

Heart goes out to their family, friends, teammates, and loved ones. Hope their brothers who are in the hospital right now make it through

They look so friendly and gentle. Rest In Peace. This is horrible. I’m so sorry.

Lavel used to be in my poetry class. I could tell he was a kind soul

Sending love and thoughts to their families and the UVA community from WA state

Those contagious smiles represent the enthusiasm and love these young men had for football and UVA. This is heartbreaking in every way.

Wondering if it was jealousy. One player no longer on the team and three others being successful on the field and in life...

Thinking of their families and loved ones.

RIP, so senseless

So much potential and hope. All gone in split seconds. Unfortunate.

my heart keeps breaking..

Go to all the home games, so, so tragic. My Daughter was off campus and safe

sickening may they RIP

All so young and happy. Senseless tragedy.

they were so so young! My heart is broken for their families. There is an epidemic of gun violence that is taking away too many young lives in this country. They were just starting their journeys :(

I am so sorry this happened to your school. I ama Texas alum but would give up all our wins this season to unmake this tragedy. I don’t understand why someone would do this.

Can’t understand why anyone would want to harm those three young men. A senseless loss.

My first thought as well. So heartbreaking.

Yes jealousy or maybe something to do with a partner?

Queen Elizabeth walks the Lawn before dinner at the Rotunda in 1976

shame, she would have loved trin

[The Royal Visit](https://uvamagazine.org/articles/a_royal_visit) In 1976, Queen Elizabeth II visited several cities in the United States to commemorate the nation’s bicentennial. On July 10, she toured Monticello and the Academical Village, where an estimated 18,000 people watched her stroll down the Lawn. Virginia Gov. Mills E. Godwin hosted a luncheon for the queen in the Dome Room of the Rotunda. A potentially uncomfortable moment for the queen was averted by professor Ray Bice and Alexander “Sandy” Gilliam Jr. (Col ’55), former secretary to the Rector and Visitors, and current University history and protocol officer. Before the event, Gilliam, who chaired the planning committee, walked the queen’s route at the same time of day she would. As he reached the top of the stairs to the Dome Room, he discovered “the sun would hit the queen right in her eyes and she wouldn’t be able to see anything,” said Gilliam. Bice came up with an ingenious solution. Accessing the Rotunda roof through a trap door, Bice glued white butcher paper to the oculus to block the sunlight. Because he used water-soluble glue, rain eventually washed the paper away. “That was just like Ray, to come up with a \[solution\] like that,” Gilliam said.

Oh another racist walking the lawn. I wonder where I’ve seen that before. Edit: thanks for the gold! I was expecting all the downvotes from the colonizers and their sympathizers.

Was that photo by Ed "Flash" Roseberry?

Shame they didn’t have sunglasses back then

When I was a first year in 90, we had a dinner event in the Rotunda for our dorm and Bice was the speaker. He told us this story and several others about the Queen at this visit. Absolutely one of my best memories of college.

There has been a ton of conversation about the need for a large protest. Tomorrow, we will walk out to demand that UVA protects ALL students. Don’t miss this opportunity to take a stand and to use your first amendment rights!

I have so much pity for those in this thread who are drinking the poisons of Facism, Zionism, and White Supremacy. They will come for you, if not next, eventually. When green card holders and students are no longer allowed to exercise their rights to free speech, how can you expect to maintain any of your freedoms? You sign off on the suffering of those you hate, not realizing you are deeply connected to their plight and it very well may be you next. Zionism is Nazism. Im saying this as a Jewish person. We are murdering our own family. It is Blasphemy. Suffering and Genocide comes at a steep price. Can you afford it?

Nah I got a test to study for

For bright intelligent students this seems like a rather stupid protest. The University of Virginia has nothing to do with this, and you have to know that protesting by walking out of classes you’re paying for will accomplish absolutely nothing. Why not a protest to return the 14th Dalai Lama from exile? Both are guaranteed to get the same results.

Walk out of what? Just don’t break anything or obstruct anyone and we cool. Walk Hard. ![gif](giphy|GodNQldQA0zNm)

show your support for the anti-Hamas Palestinians protesting in Gaza

Sure, put all the employees that work at UVA at risk of losing their jobs, when they cut grant & indirect funding to the bone (just like Columbia) because the students want to protest. You don't have to like the policies, but at least don't throw gasoline on a dumpster fire.

People seem to forget that freedom of speech isn’t absolute. You can’t defame people. You can’t shout fire in a crowded theater. You can’t call in a bomb threat. And if you’re not a citizen, you can’t support a designated terrorist organization (Hamas in this case) with your speech because the penalty includes deportation. If you’re a citizen, you obviously won’t face the threat of deportation. It’s really pretty simple. And if you’re protesting at UVa, you should be fine as long as you keep it peaceful, follow rules set by the property owner (UVa), and don’t threaten/intimidate/vandalize. Columbia, UCLA, and other schools featured protests that became violent, which is where things crossed the boundary from protected free speech into breaking the law. Don’t infringe on the rights of others- even if they’re Jewish! Even if they believe their family in Israel has a right to exist!

I would suggest to focus on one thing

Free. Free Speech!

you all get fails for the classes you miss.

Protesting defiance of laws? What am I missing?

I'm just an alum but I wanna say HELL YEAH, I absolutely support yall and I would be protesting with you if I was there 👏👏

Why was Khalils group distributing protest “kits” made prior to October 7 that had Hamas media logos on them?

jfc some people on this sub are so “bystander during wwii”-esque its crazy. anyway release mahmoud khalil!!

No one is illegal on Stolen, Bloody Land. UVA was built by so many enslaved architects, masons, skilled workers, People! People whose blood was spilled on the bricks and lawn you pride yourself in walking over. The time for reckoning approaches. Every drop of blood spilled comes at a steep price. The blood debt must be paid. Free Palestine, Free Turtle Island, Free those kept in the ICE concentration camps!

Yeah so… what do these two issues have to do with each other? A war that began before any of us were born, and illegal immigrants being deported?

I don't support terrorists

Excellent! The authorities will surely release him after 80 twenty-something year olds walk out of a college class they paid for! Those ICE officials won’t know what hit them! Jokes aside- it’s a righteous fight, but do something meaningful. This is a great way to convince other students you’re a good person and feel good about yourself. Otherwise you are doing absolutely nothing of value to the detriment of your studies. Have a bake sale or organize a parade around cville then donate proceeds to his legal funds. It’s great you’re eager to support, but be strategic in your efforts.

Let me know how that works out for you

Don’t forget the National strike coming this Labor Day. We are going to extend it until all MAGA Republicans are forced out of office and resign.

This is stupid , I rather study

I noticed that the protest being advertised is based on two specific demands: “Hands off Gaza” and the release of a visa student. However, it seems that many people attending are doing so for reasons beyond the stated objectives. This raises the question—why join a protest if you don’t fully support or even understand what it stands for? Also, are people aware that the government wouldn’t be taking legal action if the only issue at hand was someone’s speech? The students and the individual in question are also facing lawsuits from families of hostages—some confirmed dead, others possibly still alive. These lawsuits aren’t just about words; they allege that these individuals aided Hamas in some way, contributing to the massacre of innocent men, women, and children. There’s also evidence suggesting they had prior knowledge of the attack, with posts referencing and celebrating what was about to happen right before it took place. As you get older, you realize that the most valuable asset you have is time. If you’re going to dedicate your time to a cause you claim to care deeply about, it’s worth making sure you fully understand what you’re supporting. It’s shocking that groups affiliated with protests like these have been harassing, attacking, threatening, and even preventing Jewish students from safely attending college—simply for being Jewish. That alone should make anyone reconsider what they’re standing behind. I’d be willing to bet that most people attending this protest don’t actually know who Mahmoud is or the real context behind what’s happening. Personally, I wouldn’t waste a second of my time supporting something based on hearsay. Protesting can be an easy way to virtue signal—showing up just to claim you care—but when you look at the return on investment, it’s practically nothing. If people truly want to make a difference, education and financial success will always surpass what a protest could accomplish. And when you put in the effort to succeed in life, you might find your perspective on these issues shifting. Don’t fall into the trap of thinking you have endless time just because you’re young. Those with more life experience have something youth simply cannot—wisdom gained through surviving the hardships of life. Hopefully, this message encourages at least one person to take a step back and truly evaluate their choices. Lead, don’t follow. Create, don’t destroy. Be grateful for every day and the small things in life. If you want to change the world, do it for the better. The only guarantee in life is death, and the world doesn’t owe anyone anything. Good luck to all.

this is so dumbahh youre going to get trump on your ass for this one

Break out the water cannons

Cc’ing ICE bye

Clown Garbage lol🤦‍♂️

Wow. People really support this garbage. Let's go ICE! Keep rounding em up

You just want to protest. You don't care about any particular cause or individual. And that makes you a fool.

Bro is about to walk out this country… in cuffs.

Really absurd trying to invent a reason to protest so you can feel impotent

What would this even do? Spread awareness? Like you would accomplish literally nothing by doing this go do something instead of just skipping class because someone got arrested

At least you are getting a lot of your idiotic "causes" out of the way at once instead of having to waste multiple days........

Deport the jihadist now. Universities are the breeding ground of leftist antisemitism

How did it go?

I heard Khalil is being released tonight because the entire country is shaking in their boots due to your protest. You are a hero!!!!

I have too many Jewish friends, and I have seen what has happened to them on campuses. You'll have to count me out.

Love how libs are defending killing babies, protecting terrorist, illegals entering our country illegally, drugs coming accross our boarders and men in women’s bathrooms.😂 How they plan to win another election is scary with that platform.

Call for the destruction of the West and America as well as the jews…. Yup lets keep him here, he will fit right in with the Democrat party

A Nazi parade? What is this? 🙄

You're really going in for someone who supports ISIS. Maybe you should leave too.

Not going to happen. Pro Hamas is out and so will be he.

Federal funding bye bye

Deport him today

Gays for Palestine! Derp!!!

WE DID IT!!!!

Jesus, I was at the corner dancing my ass off for hours after the win. ‘Something I normally would never do, but goddamnit, the allure of the whole thing, the surrealism of it all, I had no choice. This has been one of the most incredible nights of my life. Thank you so much Tony Bennet, thank you so much you wonderful student athletes! Tonight we bask in unwavering splendor. I’d like to throw a special shout-out to the universe for making this an actuality. Thank you everyone in Hoo nation(s); together we are united in victory!

From a UNC fan, congrats to our awesome neighbors. The ACC is so proud of you.

HOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOS!!!!!!!!!

It'll take a few months to absorb this. Oh my god.

Congrats boys!!!!

Congrats from a Hokie! Hell of a game! Y'all deserved this redemption

Hey ! Trying my best to get around to styling the subreddit a little better. If you wanted, I'd love to commission you to make some of the subreddit's banner/background/art!

LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO HOOS DONT LOSE

Yay now everyone can go back to not caring an annoying amount

Awesome game!

Hello from a UTEP fan, a school better known as Texas Western back in 1966 when we won the first and (thanks to Virginia) still the only Texas NCAA Basketball Championship. Tech had a hell of a run but in El Paso we’re glad to hold on to the distinction for another year and we salute you! Go Miners and Go Hoos!

How do you pronounce that, WA-hoo-WA or wa-HOO-wa? Just curious.

^^everyones mood!!

Thank you brother!! Great time to be alive

Thanks neighbor :) Fuck that announcer bringing up the UMBC game with 30 seconds on the clock overtime when we were like 8 up.

Depends on the chant, we use both. Also HELL YA WE WON BOYS WAHOOWAAAA

Ngl, kinda upset at all the hoos partying outside my apartment at 1am but I'll let it slide this one time

Thanks. Have always been curious about that.

Haha sorry, hope it wasn't too bad

I’m never participating again ✋

worst thing for me is if i see my face pop up in the recording. even if I don’t actually say anything. Bleh

Protip: just don't speak in lecture

Wow look at me the extrovert who speaks during lecture

Rewatch a lecture?

"What if we used a 100% of our brains"

That one time i saw myself I yawning like a pig on sleep meds woken up by the smell of stale food.

I participate a lot during lectures because if I don’t I will struggle to listen. I know it’s cringe but otherwise I get distracted too easily.

You don't like the sound of your own voice? What's that like because I wish I could hear myself speak non-stop without having to actually speak... Is this why people do acid? To hear themselves speak? Do I understand reality altering drugs now? Is this what schizophrenia would be like? ... ( Insert paragraphs of me talking to myself ) (At some point I reenacted a fight with a former boss to see if I was still right)... ... Yeah, I'm not sure I get your struggle.

Omg yeah that’s the worst

Hahaha same I just need to skip through me talking when I rewatch

Acid is a million times crazier than hearing yourself speak lol

Defense was key to the win, again.

Love a W, but they’re testing my arteries.

We are officially a safety school now.

We are 6 and 1. Nuts!

too fucking close

I'm so happy they won, I didn't get to watch the game. It was blacked out so I was on pins and needles the entire time.

A win is a win but my god I would appreciate less cardiac threat

Great win, but disappointing to see UVA stadium with so many empty seats with 8min remaining jn 4th. Your team is top 20 and you’d rather leave than cheer them on only 10pts down. As an alum I wish I was there to cheer them on until VICTORY!

Win is a win, I hope that when this game comes up in “conversations” later on, they remember that WSU nearly beat #4 Ole Miss in Mississippi. They’re a pretty decent team with a record that doesn’t do it justice. I know we were 17 point favorites and didn’t play as well as we could’ve, but I’ll take that as a solid comeback win.

Scott Stadium helped in this win Go Hoos

Winning- beats the alternative of not winning. Hooooos!!!!!!

This team has guts! So proud of them…WAHOOWA!!!

I lowk thought they were forsure going to lose before the 4th quarter

Prepare to lose to 2-4 UNC ( we have played like absolute dog shit all year and have nothing left to lose.)

This game was sponsored by UVA Health (missed opportunity)

Yep tech is the virginia reach now

Get over yourself. UVA was always a safety school.

As an older, life-long Hoo, this feels to be uncharted territory, although my first year in Hooville, we almost had a perfect season (1-10). That one win ruined it!

Cardiac cavs

a win is a win

Absolute nightmare fuel for three quarters followed by a near-perfect fourth. Just insanity

I get that people just want the basketball points but the team is #18 and rising…you’re already at the game just freaking stay

I stayed but getting out of lots was brutal towards JPA/Fry Springs

YAR was tonight, that’s why I left early personally

It’s a late game and many of us are traveling from a few hours away.

Maybe an unpopular opinion but comparatively speaking to other ACC stadiums, Scott Stadium is a mess. It desperately needs a refresh asap

No no— “ivy reject” school. Or “tuition isn’t crazy” school. Big difference. A lot more prestige.

Bro the joke was that we won on a safety, lol.

I was there when we were ranked #1 in the country for two weeks in October 1990.

But its not like fans didint know it was a late game to begin with. That close of a ame and people leaving late in the 4th is nuts.

What things would you improve? I’m sure there are stuff I just haven’t really seen other stadiums to compare

UVA is a school for mediocre rich white kids who couldn’t get into an ivy. However, that’s just for undergrad, as all of their grad programs are like top 10 nationally (med, business, law, education, etc).

I still got 53 downvotes though. Who’s the joke now?

Big question, to any who remember. I remember this as well (though I was a young rascal back then) and remember watching that fateful game against Georgia Tech on ESPN. But I never did know, WHO did the Cavaliers beat, and who lost that enabled the Hoos to gain the number one seed?

1985, but my father went there and I grew up as a Wahoo.

Buddy is not getting into law school

We went to #1 after beating NC State. The one I really remember is beating Clemson. That was wild.

The previous number 1 team was Michigan, but they lost to Michigan State in Week 5.

Minecraft Rotunda

This is a project I’d been working on and off again for a while since around 2018. It’s not perfect 1:1 scale but I’m currently revising it to try to get closer. I have plans to fully reconstruct the Lawn and some of the neighboring buildings such as Old Cabell and the Pavilions. Hopefully I can complete it by May

Nice you got the weather right for the Rotunda as well

It’s pretty accurate....no people to be seen right now

Is there anything inside? Also, this makes me miss the magnolias that used to be there. :(

If you need any pictures of the exteriors of grounds, let me know!

Bruh this is incredible! You got a world download link?

This is super dope!

We should make as much of the UVA campus as possible !

yo update us

This is amazing!

I haven’t gotten to the interior yet :( I have only visited the Rotunda in person a handful of times, and have a very vague idea of what it looks like. Much of my progress right now is using pictures I and one of my friends took recently, Google maps, and just googling pictures of stuff. I’ll see what I can do about the inside, but for now I’m trying to get proportions right. I’m a current third year so I had to look up what the magnolias were hahaha

It was a sad day when they chopped down the Magnolias.

Thanks! I’ll keep it in mind. Stay safe in Charlottesville

It will be a long time coming but yeah if I can reach that point of progress I’ll hit you up!

Well nice work. Best wishes to you & your classmates during these strange times

I'm with her

I voted for her, she’s a cool person

Honest to God, Amelia gets stuff done. Worked with her on some club stuff when she was a first-year, and she basically skyrocketed her way to the top in a few semesters by being really, really competent.

Actually don’t vote for her she said she doesn’t want to be selected for office anymore. She was on the fence and forgot to rescind her submission. https://www.instagram.com/p/CMh2IvhHJya/?igshid=1oxnnz70s36zt

UVA Professor supports Palestine by cancelling class https://mynbc15.com/amp/news/nation-world/university-of-virginia-uva-jewish-students-parents-antisemitism-islamophobia-divest-students-protest-discrimination-october-7-us-department-of-education-pro-palestine-groups-israel-gaza-hamas-war

Can’t say much on this but faintly hope this will launch a civilized and respectful discussion about the University’s involvement in global affairs….

This is going to get very spicy very fast.

This seems like a reasonable and measured email. I don’t know why someone not attending the walkout would be more than mildly disgruntled at the change to their schedule.

All the advocates for free speech and freedom suddenly recoiling at the thought of students actually exercising it and, god forbid, a professor that doesn’t punish them for it as well

cannot possibly understand what the ultimate goal of this is

Good for her!

You know who loves this most of all? BOV member and enfant terrible Bert Ellis. He'll be waving this email around like Sen. Joe McCarthy at a Cold War hearing to show that his dystopian myth that UVA has been reduced to a hotbed of indoctrination into "wokeism" and "cultural marxism." The professor's email contains all of the elements that Ellis and his "Jefferson Council" have been alleging. What couldn't she just teach the class and then go to the protest or whatever by herself?

May allah reward him for his/her humanity

What a great professor. Love to see solidarity from staff!🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸

Students should get some tuition money back for the professor cancelling class. They are just casually wasting the students' money if they cancel class and they aren't severely ill or have some sort of family emergency.

dEcOlOnIzInG aRcHiTeCtUrE

Is the class at the same time as the event?

The economic potential of students taking a class on "Decolonizing Architecture" is effectively rock bottom anyway. At least this may allow them to focus on more fruitful courses.

awesome! i would love to get a day off for some stupid reason. biden is the one who will get a ceasefire in israel tho, not teachers who cancel class and people who literally themselves on fire.

Oh to be a college professor. Never having to admit that you have a bad hangover or something. Just “oh I am cancelling everything I have to do today in solidarity with whatever the students are fired up about right now.”

UVA is spicy idk if I want to apply for grad school or not. Lot of spicyness 👀

**If I've learned anything about Americans in the age of social media, it's that they tend to wait until they have all the facts, challenge their own pre-conceived beliefs, and never go overboard trying to ruin the lives of people based solely on nuanced views of complex political issues. I'm incredibly hopeful for the future.**

The problem is cancelling classes for political Situations. There could be one every day and if you cancel for one political event it’s discriminatory to not cancel for another.

Let her have all freedom she wants. I guess you support the protestors stopping traffic when an ambulance with a dying person in it right? Freedom of speech right?

UVA has a very large endowment and people are asking for the Foundation to give an accounting of how much of those funds are invested in firms that profit from war. If an audit shows that UVA's endowment is helping to support apartheid, students are asking for divestment. In 1987, UVA divested from South Africa for similar reasons.

Thank you for stating this. This act is not going to save a single Palestinian or Israeli (university investment companies have historically ignored divestment proposals passed by the student council) and is going to help put a massive target on the back of the university. This is pretty good proof for those who are considering pulling back resources from and fundamentally changing the University that activism at UVA disrupts in its mission as an educational institution.

You wouldn't accept a Jewish state in the Middle East no matter how it was formed, it would be an affront to Allah

Without offering any opinion on the Palestine issue, there is more to education than class lectures. Multiple cancelations are problematic. One cancellation is an opportunity to discuss all of these meta issues such as the role of higher level educational institutions in the political arena. Possibly a more valuable experience than the lecture would have been. (Edited for typo)

From prior experience, when classes are cancelled, there are makeup classes.

Whether you agree or disagree, walkouts, strikes and peaceful protests that are not met with severe punitive action are all signs of a healthy democracy. Beyond voting these are some of the best tools for enacting change.

This is accurate. You're paying for the number of credits after all, which corresponds to the amount of lecture.

The economic potential of you being on Reddit is 0 so you might as well be a good little bootlicker and spend the rest of your life selling your soul to your employer

Believe it or not, politicians actually want to get re-elected. Displays of public discontent do actually matter in democracies, to a degree

Oh my bad, I accidently used bold-font instead of sarcasm font. Silly mistake.

don’t use logic people might get angry at you for having critical thinking skills and a brain😠

Per your comment there are political events happening everyday, has the professor cancelled class every day? No. This was one instance that the Professor cancelled class, you’re very much welcome to sit in the class or do the readings, whatever that may be. But allow people to have their own political opinions, just as you do. Edit: It is not discriminatory to support some political events and not others. I think you should look up the definition of “discriminatory” before you go to class.

Genocides don't happen every day. Or at least they shouldn't!

So actually that’s an entire new example that’s completely different from this one. And no I don’t support that

? A lot of people make bold remarks particularly about protests blocking traffic, but usually if a protest is on the street and protestors deny to allow passage, it’s because they received permission from their city council to do so. EMS is well aware of these protests and are able to navigate around them just fine. I’d know because I actually worked for an EMS station in a city which frequently had protests. Also, why don’t I hear these same frustrations about traffic blocking ambulances when it’s a football game and not a protest? Those are even worse for us! Not only are they often more difficult to navigate and often less coordinated than protests, but they’re for a less worthy cause’! That is unless you’re projecting your disapproval of this particular protest onto your argument.

You're going to find that things in reality are quite messy. Israel has some industry leaders in the technology and medical sectors. The thing with modern economies is it's not like these things are just percentages of market share, they represent crucial components and parts in complex supply chains. You the consumer are most likely a hypocrite here to? Did you post to reddit on a microsoft, apple, or samsung device? You're supporting the military industrial complex. The world is lot messier than people are allowing with their rhetoric and proposals, don't be stunned when the people in charge roll their eyes at such rash naivete

Why stop there? Why not compel the engineering school to forbid defense contractors, the DoD, and intelligence agencies from recruiting? The first one is their top employer after all. UVA's value is in large part based upon war profiteering. Edit: Given most of these kids are from NOVA and are consequently children of employees at said war profiteers, UVA should disavow them all. The tuition itself is soaked with the blood of Muslims.

ur not real

Do you know the difference between Jewish “state” and “country” and what does that have to do with islam or what verse did even make you say that

That’s literally Islamophobia

Counterpoint: The students are not paying to discuss the role of higher education in politics— which itself is a very opinionated debate (a lot of people, myself included, *believe they should not *have* a role in politics). First and foremost, the students are there (and paying) to learn about their major to then use that knowledge to better society. Cancelling class to support either side of a political agenda (and same as you, without offering an opinion on the Palestine issue) is undermining the core purpose of the students even being there, in my eyes. Unless it’s related to the class somehow, that is. And judging by the material mentioned in this letter, it seems it may be. The letter does not specify which class is being canceled. *Edit: added a word

Nah never.. ppl just get more load to do the following session

I'm getting paid quite well to surf Reddit at the moment.

We'll all be selling our souls, but some will be selling it in an office job or as a retail clerk. This class is for the latter. &#x200B; I suspect you're the kind that complains about the unfairness of the US economy while knowingly choosing a useless major?

you sound like the person on twitter who parroted about leftist things and called people bootlickers all day but then turned out to be working for raytheon

not a single person ive seen say they arent voting Biden over gaza have changed their mind since biden started pressuring for a ceasefire. im sorry but gaza should not be a big issues in america, if we cut all funding to israel, even non military they lose less than 10 percent of their military budget. i think abortion and healthcare access and student loans and public transportation and fair taxes are far more important than israel.

Oh- and here is UVA’s discrimination policy which political affiliation: the University will not tolerate discrimination or harassment in the workplace, academic setting, or in its programs or activities based on age, color, disability, family medical or genetic information, gender identity or expression, marital status, military status (which includes active duty service members, reserve service members, and dependents), national or ethnic origin, political affiliation, pregnancy, race, religion, sex, sexual orientation, or veteran status.

Astrophotography on the Lawn

First image is The Milky Way over Old Cabell Hall, which I photographed last week. A journalist from UVA Today accompanied me for the shoot, which you [can read about here](https://news.virginia.edu/content/alumnus-captures-another-stunning-lawn-photo-one-includes-milky-way). The second image I shot last year, and is of the Heart and Soul Nebula over the Rotunda. For more of my work, [check out my Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/brennangilmorephoto).

Hello, new phone wallpaper

One Hell-uva shot!

Beautiful work. What’re your specs/what software did you use to stack?

Is there a way to download a full Rez of this?

Astrophotography is so cool and I'd love to be able to take photos like yours but the process seems so intimidating. I've glanced at a subreddit for this stuff and I'm always like, "ehhhh..." I've got enough hobbies that I've started and never come back to, lol Amazing work!

Totally agree! So cool. OP could offer a short-class for $… I’d pay

This has been a thing since at least ISIS (pre-SIS in the 00s)

Death, taxes, and sis crashing during enrollment

Can confirm. I was there during the changeover

Happy Cake Day!!

If you're going down to Danville, consider giving back to the community there. This is not meant to shame anyone out of going to Danville and getting your vaccine. Get your vaccine, get things back to normal. Getting shots in arms by any means necessary is the right thing to do, obviously. All that said: the fact that there's so much excess vaccine in a city that's predominantly poor and Black is making me think someone up the chain significantly fucked up outreach/advertisement/distribution down there, and we're getting the opportunity to take advantage of that. A bunch of kids driving two hours south, getting their shot, and leaving isn't going to help matters for the people who live there, and the fact that they're openly advertising to us is weird. So I think, if you have the means and you're heading down to get your (free) vaccine, you should consider giving a bit of cash to an organization that does good work. It's a minor thing, but it's the only way I can think of giving Danville some benefit for suddenly being the vaccination hub for the greater Charlottesville area. Someone posted this list in a groupchat I'm a part of and it seems like a good starting point. Let me know if you know any other good orgs. Gods Storehouse Danville (food bank): [https://www.godsstorehouse.org/help/give/donate.html](https://www.godsstorehouse.org/help/give/donate.html) Wendell Scott Foundation (after school programs for at-risk youth, named in memory of the first Black NASCAR driver to win a major championship): [https://www.wendellscott.org/donate.html](https://www.wendellscott.org/donate.html) House of Hope (shelter for the unhoused): [https://www.danvillehoh.org/donate/](https://www.danvillehoh.org/donate/) HAVEN (for domestic violence survivors): [https://havenofthedanriverregion.org/](https://havenofthedanriverregion.org/) EDIT: /u/BlitzNerf posted a great list of locally-owned restaurants below. At the very, very least, grab some lunch in Danville and support local businesses while you're getting your vaccine!

To add some businesses/food options: * Phi-lly Cheese Steaks & Things * Soul Food Express * Ma's Cakes * El Vallarta * San Marcos * Dell'anno's Pizza Kitchen * Mucho Taqueria * Midtown market * Lynn Street Market * Crema and Vine (coffee joint) * Links Coffee There are many others but these come to mind

Another one from the Vaccine Groupchat! https://danrivernonprofits.org

This is awesome. What a great idea. Hope everyone who's able to follows your suggestions.

Carpool with friends and take in an evening of ace throwing while you’re down there. https://www.grizzlyshatchet.com

Thank you for this. Thanks to this sub too to getting the word out! Love from a Hokie :)

Anyone know how many shots Danville has left?

Thanks for all the resources! These are great, but I’d love to help with the vaccine effort since that is the problem we’ve run into specifically. Does anyone know how we might be able to phonebank/otherwise get out the word to local Danville residents?

God’s Pitcrew is another really good one! https://godspitcrew.org/

Danview restaurant was epic

I’m a Virginia tech student who got suggested this post for some reason

nana karen’s & king cropp also a local restaurants downtown! links is my favorite by far

Dan River Nonprofits and the United Way ([https://unitedwaydpc.org](https://unitedwaydpc.org)) seem to be the most effective, because they help raise funds for all of the local nonprofits!

Let your friends know too Edit: walk-ins are closed now

Looks like they're stopping walk-ins now fyi

Danville has 3k shots a day for the next 85ish days. The most they've ever given out in a day was about 2.5k. However, they thaw vaccines as they go, so try to get there before 4:30.

I’m about an hour out. Hoping they still have them.

The authorities do not appear to have phonebanking/canvassing/etc. as things that people can do. The messaging on walk-ins vs. preregistering has also been muddled. Social media is the only thing that people can do.

Unfortunately social media seems to be the most accessible way to do this. Maybe reaching out to churches in the area could help, since church leadership may have a network familiar with community outreach in relation to healthcare ? It's common for churches in rural communities to be involved in things like this (ie providing a location for drive-up type healthcare to be offered for different screenings, driving local residents to get their vaccine could be an idea... etc)

No, and it’s wrong to make assumptions about a community you’re not a part of, especially if you are benefiting from it by getting a vaccine there

>Danville a racist shit as yes, a racist town... makes sense

Walked in at 3, walked out at 325. That included my 15 minute waiting time to make sure I didn’t have a reaction. Get there is you can!!

what makes people from NOVA so... like that? Look. I don't aim to hurt any feelings or whatever, but holy god it's so hard to live around all these nova kids. Most are so boring & anti-social in the most basic sense. They can't hold a conversation and tend to stare at their phones any free second they have - no matter if it's class, walking between class, bathroom, waiting in lines, elevators, restaurants, bars, I consistently have noticed that nova kids use phones so much more. If you have the courage to talk to neighbors/people you see in passing often, the nova kids act like you're an alien. Sometimes they just stare when you try to make a joke or chat, as if you've broken some unfathomably important law and will be eliminated by a satellite laser beam in 3 seconds. Like Brainrot 2.0 hit those kids or something. I've never seen a population that's so dead inside and disconnected. This is based off real life, like completely cause I don't carry a phone with me & am not on social media. In all seriousness does anyone have concrete causal factors to point to? I want to empathize with/ understand them, because maybe there's a cultural aspect/something else that I'm missing. for context I was born & raised in RVA, and I love my city most for it's friendly/laid back/cool inhabitants. Cville so ass

Imagine living in a world where you are told from age 3 that you need to be proving yourself and excelling at everything because anything less than perfection and the top 5% of your class of pre-kindergarteners is unacceptable and a sign of your laziness. Now repeat that for everything. Sports? Gotta be on the travel league. Exams? You need a private tutor to keep up. Etc etc etc. Now add in a layer of constantly being reminded that you have a position of privilege that others don't, money to indulge in whatever hobbies you pick (but you have to be the best obviously) and parents who will show up to harass your teachers if they dare ruin your future with bad grades. It makes for some kinda messed up kids (not all of them, but enough of them). Mix in the era of social media so you can constantly compare yourself against everyone else and, well I feel bad for them.

Consider that the NOVA kids here are (generally) either 1. Super outgoing overachievers or 2. Extreme nerd overachievers who have had their heads dug in textbooks and test prep since age 8. Seems like maybe you are running into the second type more than the first. Are you in engineering or CS?

I can't speak to now, but 30 years ago, there were just so many of them that they never had to leave their high school friend groups. There was an entire suite in Watson with just students from Thomas Jefferson HS. There was a general contempt for students from the rural parts of the state.

The way people not from NoVA talk about people who are from NoVA makes me wonder what people really think it’s like and if they’ve spent any real time there. We’re also regular people lol.

I think you're just an extrovert running into a lot of tired introverts lol

Seems a crazy over-generalization but okay

I don't think people from NoVA are any different than anyone else in terms of phone usage or being social. I think you're making a generalization based on some anecdotal experiences.

Isn’t Reddit social media?

This is rage bait

You are generalizing all NOVA kids with the ones who chose UVA. Maybe generalize their uni choice first. UVA is very hard to get into from NoVA and generally that can make you snobby imho. Flame me as you will but they don’t get in for their personality.

It's all in your head. I have met many people from other areas of Virginia that are just as bad. You are at UVA, of course there is going to be a disproportionate amount of dickheads. I was born and raised in NOVA and I turned out fine.

lol ok transfer to VCU then 😵‍💫I have also met many annoying hipster chainsmoking cooler-than-thou RVA kids and many great outgoing friendly RVA kids. Seems like the common problem might be you if all 4000 NoVA kids are pulling out their phones when you talk to them

Being from NOVA means many different things depending on your specific location (Woodbridge couldn’t be more different from Arlington for instance) your cultural background, your social background, etc. You’re gonna meet a lot of people who aren’t how you’re describing and they’ll probably be from somewhere in NOVA.

You are on social media currently

You need to get out of your own bubble of Richmond and stop generalizing everyone from a single region. There's a lot of various people from NoVA that I've met that have been the most outgoing, chill people ever. I come from bumfuck nowhere and NoVA has really been an eye opener for me

As a NOVA native and UVA alumna, we grow up in a hyper competitive environment, we’re just built differently. 🤷🏻‍♀️

No one says they’re from the DMV.

They generally have more money

It's the parents people! Parents in NoVA are architecting every aspect of their child's lives. What elementary or middle school kid needs to have an iPhone? NONE. It's a status symbol. A flip phone or lower cost phone is perfectly fine. Travel leagues/clubs create an untouchable elitist mindset that limits other student participation in sports. Paying for tutoring or paying for test prep or even PAYING FOR COLLEGE ESSAY WRITING. It's insane. New cars for new drivers....I could go on and on.

That’s what happens when you are born and bred in an area with no culture, personality, and identity. NoVa is a giant strip mall devoid of a soul. It produces similar people. NoVa resident of 30 years

Are you considering Cville to be NoVA?

And what’s with the use of the word ‘like’ multiple times in a sentence? Do their teachers and parents do the same thing? Have they never been corrected to prepare them for life in the real world? I mean’ like’ it’s tortuous listening to them.

I can’t relate to people who don’t know what the word “cause” means.

What you are describing is suburban kids in general today. This is not unique to NOVA. This is the social media generation. They were raised by their iPads, so of course they’re going to be awkward socially. The only kids I’ve seen that are not like this are rural kids, likely because they didn’t get iPads or have constant internet access like suburban kids growing up.

Honestly? I’ve met a lot of transplants to this area that I would describe having these traits… I figured they just don’t care for much connection. However the friends I have made in Nova that were raised here are the opposite of this….. I will say that moving here 8 years ago and having to make the effort to meet and make a lot more friends, I do agree with the saying “if you want to make some quality friends, you gotta wade through all the dicks first.” This also applies to dating. Good news is when u find the good ones you hold on, and hopefully don’t take them for granted!! Fuck everyone else.

I used to live in New Mexico. You were expected to talk to everyone. Even if you were having a really bad day. If you didn't people thought you were a complete asshole. Moving back to NoVA and D.C. I love that I'm allowed to totally ignore people if I so choose. I'm allowed to talk to people as well. But if I feel like minding my business that's perfectly fine. I don't owe you a conversation. It doesn't make me an asshole. People's obsessions with phones is annoying. When I'm social I try to put it down. I also talk to people. But not if I don't fucking feel like it.

They are grown up iPad kids.

When they are just staring at you they are trying to think of something to be offended about

Oh wow, just stumbled on this OOC. It was this way in the 90’s as well, in case you wondered. I always assumed it had to do with proximity to the most bland yet self-important metropolis in the US, the resultant insecurity that breeds, actively rewarding passive-aggression as virtuous, and dedication to redefining mediocrity as intelligence. I expect most national capitals are surrounded with all that.

I see no difference between kids from Richmond suburbs and Northern Virginia. I’m assuming you’re not from downtown Richmond… You are Henrico or Chesterfield? There’s no difference.

I mean the fact that you don’t have a phone and aren’t on social media makes you the minority here I think. Also to be honest, I always take a moment to look up and say hi if others cross my path, but I don’t understand when people get angry that others don’t feel the same way? Reminds me of when men tell girls “you should smile more” ….

All of it...

Hey fellow Richmonder!

I think you're noticing the "privilege" that Nova kids are wealthy ---> are early adapters of tech/culture ---> represent bleeding edge of generational norms. What you have described above is the exact "Alpha stare" that has been sort of jokingly reported on before. It's just super introverted kids who also have never had to really do anything for themselves. It's not a nova thing, but I see how that region is really bad about producing extroverts who believe in doing the soft work like socializing to reach their goals. I'm from there. It's a land that tries to produce type A's like a factory and I'm a type B for sure. It's interesting to see the rate of brilliant kids crash tf out almost immediately in college or hitting the "real" employment world after because they just aren't prepared to adjust from the world of pre-announced rebruics in academia to working and getting along with regular people in a fluid workplace.

My brother went to UVa 40 years ago, and he told me NoVas were super different then, too

“Sometimes they just stare at you when you try to make a joke or chat” Well, as an introvert, this Marylander would look at you like you had four heads. Why do you feel the need to butt into other’s lives, especially if you’ve noticed this or had this happen to you more than, say, three times?

Just a question how do you look at a person and just instantly know they’re from NoVa

Yeah maybe if you go to uva from nova lol

As a transplant to NoVa and someone who now teaches here, but is from a small town outside of Charlottesville, the teens are anxious lol. Nova is big, but small at the same time. And very competitive. And it is fast paced.

It’s been like this for a long time. Everyone is an asshole in public (unless you’re in a smaller town). I blame having the worst traffic in the world coupled with super high stress jobs, too many people, and too many different world cultures. Nobody trusts anyone

Not sure how much this really applies across the board but I have spoken to a few teenagers and got the feeling they are pressured to succeed equal or better than their parents. In NOVA there are a lot of successful, well educated parents. Many of these kids aren’t just dealing with external pressures but internal pressures. In a way, it’s really sad. I’m GenX and my parents hoped I’d be successful but just wanted me to be happy with my career decisions. It is not the same for Millennials and GenZ. They have way more stressors in life. Unfortunately, many of them measure themselves against peers on social media, worldwide. For GenX we just had to not be the biggest knucklehead in the town. I truly feel for many of these kids today. No one can live up to standards that high and be normal.

It’s probably not just a NoVA thing - maybe a lot like a UVA thing. Shyness, intellectual awkwardness, snobbery, fear of not being perfect or of making the “wrong” friends, classism, racism, elitism. My husband and I grew up in NoVA- I went to a better high school than he did (I lived in Fairfax, he in Alexandria/telegraph road), but I went to VCU and he went to UVA. He’s actually a UVA Law grad, too. VCU is infinitely more laid back, diverse, and easier to be yourself. UVA is competitive, posturing. God-forbid you’re weird or unique there. It was like my snobby high school all over again, which is why I didn’t go to UVA. But that was a long long time ago. Add the layer of internet, social media, having to always perform and market yourself online on top of having to perform socially and academically in person probably takes a lot of time. People need to escape so they duck into their phones. Or they need that free time to curate the perfect Insta or Snapchat post or whatever kids these days are using. I feel sorry for this generation. My kids are your age- 15 and 19- and they don’t use Instagram or TikTok or any of that stuff. And neither of them had/have any desire to go to UVA for the exact reasons you’re talking about. They want to go someplace friendly and open. Colleges that have great academics in a welcoming environment. All of that said, and what I tell my own teens, is you have to find your people. Find groups you wouldn’t ordinarily join, don’t stop trying to strike up a conversation. The whole school isn’t NoVA or snobs. I hope you find your people and enjoy your time at UVA.

These kids have been staring at iPads and screens since they were babies. They didn’t have the same social upbringing we did.

It’s probably the legacy kids. Their parents are a whole ‘nother thing.

The first thing my oldest of 3 UVA kids noticed was that the NOVA kids were more likely to wear their private HS swag than their UVA shirts, sweatshirts, etc. 2 sons and a daughter all graduated from UVA from Va. Beach and remain dear friends with not only their NOVA friends, but also those from many other parts of VA, as well as other parts of the US and some international, too. I think we can find something annoying or predictable about almost everyone we meet, but if you can remain open minded you may end up friends with a lot of interesting people you never would have expected to even meet. Also, I would suggest that any students getting into UVA, regardless of where they’re from, have been stressed greatly and worked their tails off to get there.

I went to college in nova 25 years ago and I swear I could have written this - before phones. Getting in an elevator in the union building on campus and having a local person leaving for the night act completely awkward because I asked them “what floor?” before pressing the buttons. Walking past someone - you’re the only two people (again, no phones in hand) and giving a slight smirk to say “hey” nonverbally just going completely ignored. I think it’s just a really socially awkward place. Always has been. So transient.

They grew up playing indoors (video games) instead of outside (<<actual games>>). That’s what I always assumed was the reason lol

Confession time..... Once I was running in a marathon on a really hot day and about Mile 22 I saw a young boy who looked like he was holding out a popsicle for me so I grabbed it and as I did and ran away I heard him say “Hey that guy took my popsicle” and I’m sorry to say that I just kept running...

It’s the news flair for me 😂

So a coworker of mine was running a marathon and there were auctually people handing out popsicle sticks that had a gel on them. My coworker thought it was something for an energy boost so he ate it. It was Vaseline to prevent chaffing.

This is exactly why I need to get into this university...

Is this related to uva?

And that young boy... Albert Einstein.

Because it’s urgent news... I really needed to get this off my chest

Yeah it’s something Jim Ryan said word for word in a video last week https://twitter.com/uva/status/1365424673153044483?s=21 see starting from around 3:53

Dude you keep eating downvotes. Why?

HOOOOOOOOOOOOOOS!!!!! The streak is over!!! WAHOOWAH!!

Good game, enjoy the win -- you guys earned it! - VT Fan

BRYCE PERKINS YOU BEAUTIFUL MAN

🥒 spam 🥒 this 🥒 gherkin 🥒 to 🥒 bless 🥒 bryce 🥒 perkins 🥒

The last time we beat Tech, I was still a student. And Reddit didn’t exist. This feels very, very good. Wahoowa!

LETS GOOOO. BRYCE PERKINS FOR ACC PLAYER OF THE YEAR!!!🧡💙🧡💙 WAHOOWAAA

🧡💙Amazing game! Wahoowa!!!🧡💙

HAH THIER TURN FOR THE INFURIATING FUMBLE THIS YEAR

The most infuriating thing you can do to a Tech fan is to not care. I had my brother in law, who is a Tech grad visiting today for a late thanksgiving believing that I thought the game was tomorrow. I also put about 10,000 pieces of UVA glitter in that fucker’s suitcase. Go Hoos.

this was revolutionary. amazing.

Good job your team isn't shit anymore

Thank you for being classy, it's been a long 15 years

I rushed the field last time, now I'm far too old to jump down that wall, but still WAHOOWA

It is also really amazing to realize how much success UVa has had in so many other sports in that time span, yet couldn't get a single win against VT in football. We need to be able to beat VT, but would any of us have given up all those championships to change the last sixteen years?

You won a game against VT. Only took 15 years of getting whooped in the butt. Your prize? Getting whooped in the butt by Clemson.

ESPN seemed to think it was Sunday for most of the 1st half.

I'm sorry that you have literally nothing left to compare to the superior Virginia school Edit: even UVA's engineering and architecture programs was ranked better than techs this year https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-virginia/rankings/ https://www.niche.com/colleges/virginia-tech/rankings/

They installed stairs! Lmao. I’ve noticed it this season: they pulled out the bushes in front of the hill, and some of the aisles in the student section have stairs that go down to the field. I had scars for years on my forearm from scraping it on the wall after we beat GT in 2001. Looks like they finally gave up on preventing it.

Undeniably an incredible year for UVA athletics. Two national championships, the Capital One Cup, the Commonwealth Cup, and an in-state rival that has no claim to anything

Yah but fuck tech.

Let them have one year. 1.5 decades is a long ass time

I’ll take my downvotes to prove my point, I can spare them

You realize that those are based purely off of student ratings and aren't judgements on how rigorous or valuable they are? Sure it gives you an rough idea of where you stands amongst the thousands of others but not when they’re right next to each other.

Except a superior engineering program and better athletics fan bases amongst other things.

Our steak starts now though.

I mean, as someone who hires computer scientists, literally no one cares about what engineering program you graduated from if you have technical chops and the soft skills to match. I hire and am happy to employ VT students but every UVA engineering graduate I've had the pleasure of working with has had much, much better soft skills and the longer their careers play out the more those make the difference between good and great. VT has a solid engineering school but it suffers from a cloistered approach to higher education. The decision to handle classes in humanities, literature, etc within the engineering school was a mistake and it hurts the long term prospects of VT grads. Just my two cents.

Amongst other things? What happened to only caring about sports people watch? That's what we've been hearing for the last fifteen years when we've been better than you at almost everything. Today you lost the one thing you had on us in terms of athletics. Besides, we have incredible soccer programs, a men's tennis team that has won four national championships in the last six years, and a baseball team with a CWS, a basketball team with four recent regular season ACC championships, two tourney championships, and a national championship. Our lacrosse team just won a natty, our women's field hockey program almost just went all the way, and our women's lacrosse is great. Track and Field and Swimming are absurd. We also have more ACC championships in all sports than every other team in the ACC. Also, UVA engineering is pretty good. Tech's is better in rankings, sure, but the twenty-or so spots that Tech beats UVA engineering in does not even come close to the absurd gap almost every other academic program at Virginia eclipses Virginia Tech.

Trolling included?

i feed bad for you buddy. imagine trying to one up UVA as a regional safety school. it’s okay though, go eat some nice food and you’ll feel better - you have that going for ya

Yeah simply going in and getting your degree isn't enough. Directly applying the skills you learn while in college helps a ton. There are plenty of senior design teams like FSAE which are good not only for applying engineering skills, but also learning those soft skills.

I just love an elegant roast. this was delightful to read. go HOOS!

Guess HOOS going to be on Jeopardy!? Watch me in the Jeopardy! National College Tournament on February 16th (8:30pm on ABC, next day on Hulu)!

Here's a [link to the Jeopardy! site](https://www.jeopardy.com/contestant-zone/national-college-championship) with more info on the matchups! I really recommend watching the whole tournament; the other contestants are all such cool and wonderful people, and I had an awesome time watching them shine on stage.

I’ll be watching with my friends! Can’t wait to see you make us proud 🤩🤩

Good luck! Or congratulations!

Easy win. No pressure

So cool! This is amazing!

Good luck go hoos!

Rock it out!!!

Good luck. Always good to see a Hoo and member of Brown College on national TV.

Good luck!!

Good luck and WAHOOWA!

congrats and best of luck!!!

Just remember achilles is pronounced uh · ki · leez

Yeah, I've just gotta take out \[checks notes\] MIT and Vanderbilt... No biggie! 😅

You won! Nice work!

Acceptance Package arrived Is it fair to say it was a little disappointing 🫠

They send packages now? 😅

Damn that's way more than I got. Which was nothing.

yall are getting boxes now? i got an 11x17 letter with some stickers and a paper pennant

honestly from what i know they only sent out envelopes in the past with ur acceptance letter and a sticker 😭 i’m more than grateful for this box this year

What was disappointing about it?

Class of '96 , double Hoo ... when I got in early decision in 1991, that envelope with only a letter inside had me and my family dancing (and we don't dance). Rock those shoelaces, put that sticker on your laptop or travel mug, and Wahoowa!

Damn I just got an email and 100k in debt

??? Disappointing? Bro getting anything is wild — do other universities send out acceptance boxes?? Is this a thing?

Is it wrong to admire UVA for putting more effort into the quality of education over trinket bribes to lure students in? For me it was the worse schools giving bigger acceptance merch packages to look more appealing than the better schools’ acceptance letters

You're lucky. I got accepted in 2020-2021 and all I got was papers, brochures, and stickers in an envelope

That's very cool. In 1991, I got a fat envelope with an acceptance letter, financial docs, and a sticker.

ooo what is inside of it?

Wait you get boxes?? That’s kinda sick

Welcome to UVA indeed

Oh that’s cool! Back in 2007 I got an envelope with docs to fill out and a sticker 🤣

All I got was a fat enveloped stuffed with paperwork. Congrats!

What’s in the box?! WHATS IN THE BOX?!

Congratulations! Oh happy day!

Congrats and Wahoowa!

Wow! They’ve upped their game!

i got a digital congratulations letter and that’s it😭👍

That’s fancy! Can you show and tell what’s in there?

Do international students also get one ???

What was in the package? Are you attending?

Bruh, I didn’t get one

That you got accepted? Or you don’t like the package?

That's a helluva way to say thanks

No way you got a package??? I had to log in to check my acceptance status 😭

In the age of promposals that sometimes out do actual proposals, these schools have to show out. I wonder what that old school I love on 64 gives out these days. Oh and congrats!!!! Wherever you choose to go, wishing you tons of success! 🙂

Got mine too!

Congratulations! Take pics of what’s in the box!

All I got was a letter and some stickers from UMich 😭😂

what’s in the box???

Which state are u from? I haven’t gotten mine yet

Which program? Undergrad?

Unfortunately, I agree! I was sort of hoping that there would be more than one sticker at least. The shoelaces were cool, though!

Super disappointing. Honestly, I’d pick a different school.

My son got accepted and got the same box. I thought it was kind of cool but as a teen he did not. We can't come close to affording to send him anyway.

Does UVA have a good Veterinarian program?

I wish I got that much when I got in. The only difference was the letter envelope was bigger than a rejection letter. I was grateful for that much. Now I'm like with expectations like this is this where all my donations go? Swag packages before you even counter accept? Just because you get in doesn't mean you are going yet.... Save it for those that commit.

I wish the packages had a little more to it tbh

the playlist is giving the "we are young" millenialcore song on tiktok

Do they send them to everyone or just in state?

middddd give me a hat or socks or something

Congrats on the debt!

That's an expensive box for just shoelaces. What a waste of money.

Ok so UVA is official now? No more UVa bs?

I think the majority of us are feeling this rn

This really captures the essence of Zoom U c/o 2020

Oof! Now if only the university cared. I tried to point this out to people and now I've been fired as an instructor.

No fall break has been some absolute dog shit

I feel like I've been working harder than ever and been doing worse than ever. Not one to complain but this semester has not been easy. Hope everyone's doing okay. Keep your head up.

Thanks for my first two awards, guys! I'll try to ignore the fact of what that means for us all. Just know that we're all struggling through this together, and that things will be so much better when restriction lift. Your feelings are 100% valid, and are perfectly normal considering the circumstances. Please be patient with yourself and don't be afraid to put your mental health first, even if that means dropping that class you've been considering. Take some time out of your day - everyday - to do something for yourself. You are amazing, and the fact that we've made it this far is worth applauding. You deserve to be happy.

Soooo messed up

What happened to your students? Do they lose credit hours for the class?

Wait was that you that my friend posted about on Twitter? That's fucking cold dude; they had no good reason to do that.

Winter break is gonna be like six weeks though right?

it’s my first year— is college usually not this stressful and overwhelming when it’s in person? i can’t imagine having to do *this* for 4 years. i’m already struggling with everything and i’m in “easy” classes!

Was one of my favorite books!

I'm sorry :( That had to have been very difficult

It's a long story. I'll write a post about it either once it is resolved, or once the semester is over. Which ever comes first.

Someone else is taking over the class and is going to make sure it's run the 'correct way.'

I don't know!

My first year was definitely stressful and overwhelming in the first semester, albeit likely because of the classes I was taking, but it's pretty normal for first years to get stressed out since they're usually coming from being the top of their class and getting straight A's. However, this year is especially bad. Typically you have fun clubs and hanging out with friends in the evenings and on weekends to look forward. It helps reduce the stress and you know you have support from everyone going through the same thing. On the other hand this year, everyone just seems miserable, including myself, despite living with 3 roommates and meeting up with other friends for outdoor distanced walks weekly. I don't think I'm nearly as miserable as the first years because I already have my friend base, so I can't even imagine how rough this is for you guys. I as well as most of my friends have dropped below 15 credits this semester just because we lack the motivation to get through the work. I felt "lazy" when I dropped them but I know it's best for my mental health, and quarantine has helped me realize that that's what's more important. Tldr; some amount of stress is normal, but once quarantine ends, it will get significantly better, so try to make the best of it that you can right now. Try your best to set down roots with people you think you will enjoy spending time with once lockdown ends and you get to enjoy real college life

John wtf you’ve been fired? The math department is off the rails

Best of luck!!!! I know you’re a grad student and many of us here are undergrads, but we’ve got your back

Must be a pretty severe misdeed or malicious pattern of behavior to get removed mid-semester.

Basically one of the TAs in the math department got fired because they were taking too long to get through the material even though they made sure the students understood the material

She said one of the TAs in the math department got fired because they went slowly and made sure students understood the material but went slower than the department wanted

Hahaha who is this? Yeah, it seems like I have been. I wasn't even notified by the department; the guy taking over my class reached out and was like "why are they asking me to teach your class?" And I was just soooo surprised. It was bizarre.

I appreciate it.

ABD or PHD? Hard to fire professors unless they shag students.

Yeah, you'd think so, but it turns out trying to make sure my students understand the material and aren't stressed as hell is a severe misdeed and is a malicious behavior to engage in. I am, for example, a very bad man because I didn't want my student to take an exam at the normal exam time because she had to work and, even though we reached out two weeks in advance, we weren't told until two days before the test that one must choose either school or work to be a priority.

Oh, yeah that was probably me. It should be pointed out that part of the reason the material wasn't covered was because of -- what I would consider --mismanagement by the department. I think aside from that, we would have been on track. For example, there was confusion that put us behind in the second week of class, and the solution given was that we should just hold a class on the weekend to catch up, which was crazy. Also, some of the other instructors -- and even the coordinator in charge of structuring the class -- agrees that things are going to fast. I had been having conversations with people about this -- including the head of the department -- and it seemed like things were going well, so this decision to fire me from teaching seemed to come out of nowhere.

ABD, and there was no shagging. Unless you mean the school fucking over the students.

Props to you. That's bullshit and we're on your side.

im am in great pain

I'm in this picture and I don't like it

I am so dead at this point

Wubba lubba dub dub

I get it, but I don’t get it

I saw a maskless ambassador talking to an older lady (also maskless) a few weeks ago. Seems like they might not be running a very tight ship.

Last weekend on the Lawn I saw one get shouted at by two women who were part of a larger group, they eventually left but I can see why

UPDATE: lmao @ UVA‘s Labor Day policy

I literally cannot join my Zoom class that begins right now. I have not received an email from the professor either. Do I just wait? Like I literally cannot attend

This can’t be real

As a student there were very few things I disliked about UVA. Having class on Labor Day was definitely one of those things.

This is hysterical. For everyone asking, "Why could this even happen!??" it's because UVA staff do have today off as a holiday, just not academic personnel.

I work in IT and this is a huge fucking yikes. I don't know how someone scheduled maintenance but didn't check the academic calendar

No way! It's not like this was a change in the calendar. Wow.

I'm in the same situation, I think they will understand

I emailed my prof to let him know it would help if he could send out the zoom link. No reply. Class is in 4 minutes.

We all knew this had to happen. Reality is more insane than fiction ever could be.

It’s real I had to send Snapchat photos from a student of mine of printed class work to the students I TA today so they could do class

There were more than a few things I disliked. Labor day was one of them, lol.

For what it’s worth, it’s not just a UVA thing. I know U of R is having classes today for instance.

I guess ITS must be Virginia Tech fans! Lol

Lol, that explains it. Thanks. This is all hilarious.

Please tell me it’s not just me

“u/PoopyZoomyHoo” My day had been made.

In the professional world you just do both at the same time. Not in college?

that morning coffee hits at the worst time lol

I have went to the bathroom 3-4 minutes before a Zoom meeting started. No wait, actually, I have done that 4 times now, and I successfully made it back in time. I like to live dangerously.

This happens to me all the time.

They made their account for this post. 😻

Guess we made it to the front page, kind of?

Saw this while sitting in Alderman

Pimping... is.. easy?

Yay we did it

r/pics send me here 😄

Up to some crosswalk mischief last night

this is the best place for me to try and get hit by a UVA bus 🤑🤑 thanks!

Tried crossing it today, cars didn’t bother stopping

There really should be a crosswalk there

Go to a city council meeting and you can get a real one installed (or at least find out why they say they can’t)

These guys are dying for an IMP tap

Not all heros wear capes.

Absolute G behavior

Isn't there a crosswalk, like, 10 more steps towards Rice/Scott?

Am I the only one who thinks this is super dangerous? I happen to agree there should be a crosswalk there, but this seems like more than just good fun, regardless of the intent.

with lines that straight, it's clear you guys are in the eschool.

The Beatles really let themselves go during the Abbey Road album.

it WAS the best place BEFORE there was a CROSSWALK there

They'll stop if you commit to the jaywalk and stare at them

That's funny! The councilors don't have anything to do with crosswalk installation. The decision is up to the city traffic engineer and he is not interested in anymore crosswalks.

idk what that is but I think I'd like it ;)))

If you want to walk 200' up a hill and then 200' again to walk down to Olsson Hall, be my guest. People crossed here before we drew the crosswalk because it's the obvious best path for walking to class.

It just makes a spot where people frequently cross anyways more visible and brings attention to the need for a real crosswalk.

Isn’t this literally the same as a regular scrosswalk? I don’t see how it’s more dangerous

it was kind of scary to draw it, but we had someone on the lookout for cars. Plus, this is an area with a lot of people walking at all times, drivers should expect a complex street environment and drive carefully

I find a strobing bike light in their eyes is pretty effective too.

Presumably the city traffic engineer (or his boss) is hired by an elected official? Let them know without a crosswalk someone WILL get hit there and you’ve now gone on record warning them it will happen. Everybody’s got a boss!

Not until someone gets hit, and then he'll be REAL interested.

Ah yes, I forgot how averse people are in this country to walking

Notably, per [Virginia law](https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacodefull/title46.2/chapter8/article16/) any intersection on a road marked at 35mph or less is a legal crossing point where drivers must stop for pedestrians, whether marked or not.

The City Councilors are unlikely to micro-manage traffic engineering. He makes the decisions. Ironically he just emailed some crosswalk advocates to announce the upcoming installation of a marked crosswalk at Caroline Ave. and Fairway Ave.

Historically that has not been the case.

Drawing a crosswalk cannot possibly be considered anti-walking

I'd rather use one that's already there (and next to all-way stop signs, so traffic very likely to stop) and is *just* 200ft away (which apparently is a lot of extra walking?)

Calculated out on maps, it’s 475 feet of extra walking, if an average person walks at 3 mph, that’s 4.4 ft/s, meaning 108 seconds of walking. When my class at Monroe hall and Olsson hall are 10 minutes apart, that ~2 minutes makes a big difference with getting to class on time

You might be fine walking up there, but a lot of people cross there regardless of whether there is a DIY crosswalk, so we drew on the road to remind people walking and driving that the space is shared.

Old post, I know, but why would you walk 475 feet instead of crossing the street to get to your destination which is not 475 feet away? They’re walking to get to that building or they’re walking to leave that building to get to a different place and don’t want to go out of their way to get to a crosswalk. pedestrians have to go out of their way to avoid traffic, but cars just get to go wherever the fuck they want.

Why you responding to me? You’re on the same side as me

Department of Justice accuses UVA of not eliminating DEI as commanded

Imagine working your whole life to work in the Civil Rights Division of the DOJ to end up sending out shit like this. Incomprehensible.

Would be nice if the DOJ actually defined what DEI was so they knew when it was gone. Crock of shit.

Meanwhile, https://news.virginia.edu/content/uva-no-1-national-college-free-speech-rankings. Geez, can't get out of their own ways.

I don’t think this is the first threatening letter UVa has received from trumps DOJ. Whatever. Wake me up when they arrest someone or file a lawsuit.

Where is this letter actually from? Is there a link to it from and official source?

They didn’t even interpret the BOV resolution correctly. It didn’t bind the health system or the school of medicine to getting rid of their DEI offices. This is a total croc of shit and DOJ has absolutely no power to enforce the BOV resolution, not that it matters to them.

It’s convenient that they put the direct line to Mr Brown and the end. Feel free to call and give him your thoughts on the matter.

This is what happens when you attempt appeasement. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes. Great job Youngkin and his appointees.

Anything alumni can do to help UVA push back against fascists?

How about "no."

Please bro, our Founder is rolling in his grave rn

Like how can they even police and track this? Let's say UVA complies and still admits the same candidates. What will they say then? They can't say anything because that would be discriminating based on race which is what they say they are against in the first place.

Actual fascists

Getting rid of dei is a form of discrimination, why are the people who are making decisions on this 70+ years old???

Who tattled Ctfu

They are going to get rid of Ryan i bet you.

I thought education was “States Rights” ?

So, is UVa gonna capitulate again?

Just ignore this shit. Yeah the lawyers will have to play games but DOJ is outside the law.

Stand up to these motherfucking nazis! What the FUCK is happening in this country?!

I’m not educated, but let me say “Fuck that whore and the horse she rode in on!”

Welp. I’d be surprised if Jim Ryan survives this.

Didn’t their school president get some students killed in his commitment to lunacy? Of course he’s going to subvert this

Makes sense. School failed to report. Then someone whistle’blew it. DOJ responded.

This wasn’t Ellis. This was Cuccinelli.

Is there video?

It was the Supreme Court.

I try and have some empathy. We have no idea if that job supports a family. And the job market is abysmal and flooded with Harmeet’s colleagues. It’s just sad all around.

It is any mention of a minority in any sense.

Ultimately it means hiring any faculty/staff or admitting as students any women, minorities, or anyone who isn't conservative. Additionally it will also mean only teaching Approved Topics. It may not mean all those things *today*, but each day will move a bit more in that direction.

It's kind of like critical race theory, except in employment instead of schools. Make believe problems to get people upset.

We don't deserve that ranking after the University decided to limit speech on the Lawn in response to Bert and his buddies getting mad.

Universities pay for those rankings

rip Jim Ryan. The board will use this as an excuse to fire him

Exactly. Fuck em.

Looks like it's from Harmeet K. Dhillon assistant AG, Gregory W. Brown the deputy assistant AG and Jeffrey Morrison, senior counsel for civil rights devision at US DOJ

The Jefferson Council posted it on their Facebook page. Bert Ellis is a member.

Seems a little hard but maybe you can try writing letters to the BOV to reverse their decision?

Getting rid of dei isnt discrimination. dei by definition is a form of discrimination, it just favors minority groups instead of disenfranchising them. If colleges and jobs truly were select candidates solely on merit. that would be the most fair resolution. dei and affirmative action do have negative effects, a major one is that even if you are the most qualified person for the job, people will constantly be wondering if you were hired for that reason or instead because you met some dei requirement. Without dei, people would not have those types of concerns.

The BOV passed a resolution today (unanimously) that says that UVA "has made progress" implementing the earlier DEI resolution: [https://www.cbs19news.com/news/bov-unanimously-passes-new-diversity-related-resolution/article\_4fa1a543-f1b5-4470-81d0-0610a7916910.html](https://www.cbs19news.com/news/bov-unanimously-passes-new-diversity-related-resolution/article_4fa1a543-f1b5-4470-81d0-0610a7916910.html) I'm not an expert on this stuff, but that doesn't sound like something a board that wants to fire a president would say.

What are you referring to?

The DEI directive came, as the letter notes, from the *Board of Visitors*—not from the federal government. So if the Admin missed a deadline, isn’t the proper party to complain the…BOV? Why is DOJ getting involved (other than to insert themselves and make headlines)? It’s like missing the deadline to pay your personal property car tax to Albemarle County and then immediately getting a letter from the IRS.

[looked something like this](https://i.redd.it/fgc19z5b43xe1.gif)

I agree that some people may not have the luxury to leave a shitty job. But unfortunately this individual seems to love this shit. A quick look at her Wikipedia shows she’s a frequent Fox news guest, most famous for “filing numerous unsuccessful lawsuits to stop stay at home orders” during COVID, criticizing face masks, and opposing mail in voting. Oh, and for being the editor of her college paper who apparently compared the schools jewish president to hitler due to his “alleged discrimination against conservatives.” Edit: I kept reading her page. It gets worse. This lady is a certified POS.

Tbh I have no empathy for this. "It was my job" is stuff that war criminals cry all the time. Wrong is wrong, regardless of legality, if it was your job, or if you're supporting a family.

But there’s only like five conservative people in Charlottesville so who’s going to take those positions?

For rankings of academic rigor, sure, we all know that. Can you find a citation for this one though to back that up?

Another day, another victim

Gotta paint some teeth on that bridge!

Oof. Fun fact, most rental insurance specifically does not cover overhead damage.

and boy do i miss it

Number 4 on the year.

Moved away a year ago. This picture feels like home.

Even during a global pandemic, C'ville's gonna C'ville... oddly calming :)

Shipping containers are a standardized size, and I can’t imagine the height off the ground varies by much from truck to truck. Whose idea was it to build a bridge that is slightly shorter than what a truck would fit through?

The bridge is always hungry

Clearly more signs are needed since those are working. How about they set up a camera and video feed. So the warning becomes, if you don’t check your height before going under this bridge, we will post your shining moment for the whole world to see online. People would watch.... and subscribe. Also I fully agree to adding teeth to it.

I've never rented from Penske, but most places will absolutely fuck you for damage like this

I believe the 14th St rail bridge is 100+ years old, so I have a feeling it was not designed with modern trucks in mind :-). In terms of how the Corner as we know it developed around it, however, leads to better questions. The height sensor and alarm were installed in the 90s - so it makes me wonder how many vehicles had to get eaten before those were installed...

There's a famous bridge on youtube that does exactly that. Search 11foot8

I'm sure they would. I kinda feel bad for the driver though. Let's say you pull up and see that it's below clearance. What do you do? You can't exactly pull a U turn there.

it gets even more complicated in modern day because the City dug the road out as much as they could, to make it so regular cars and trucks could go through, and these trucks do damage to the bridge, the bridge is owned by the railroad company and the railroad company thinks the City should pay for a new bridge since cars keep hitting it. The City thinks maybe the railroad company should eat it, cause it's like a 2 million dollar bridge and the railroad company hasn't bothered to sue a single tuna can'd truck. one time a truck was too tall by one inch so they deflated the tires to bring it out.

Omg that is awesome! Thank you for sharing!

> 11foot8 +8 ! Thought that extra 8 inches would finally kill that bridge's appetite. Nah. It's still hungry!

You wave everyone past you, then you back up and turn left down Wertland. OR you just cut the corner way tighter... because turning left there they shouldn't have needed to go under the bridge really.

I actually wasn't aware it had been raised! Good to know though. Thanks!

Go hoos go!

Love it. Epic win. WAHOOWA!

Pfft. Goal posts did not end up in the Fluvanna River. Whatsamatterwhichyouguys?

Does this occur every time uva wins a game?

This will look like lawyers running to represent the people who got hurt, $$$$$ coming their way

i heard there were MANY who were injured and some seriously.

Found the Hokie.

What’s a hokie

A student at that school in Blacksburg. Or one of their fans.

I’m not a Virginia tech fan or a Florida state fan

Just to make sure

The right answer is “You should absolutely wear mask as you can’t get laid if the girl sees your full face”

Bruh are you even having sex or are you just asking to ask

Actually if you had the dorm norm call you would know that if you are having intercourse you should have mask. And if you are gonna suck the D you should cut your condom and put it in your mouth so you dont get covid. Some people just dont pay attention.

I don’t know what everyone is so mad about Rush for. He literally died today lmao

Are they allowing rush or something? Sorry out of the loop since I graduated

As a former IFC fraternity exec: fraternities get away with a lot at UVa because fraternity alumni are among the wealthiest and most generous donors and are often capable of taking that away if UVa does anything against their beloved Omega Zeta Alpha or whatever. It's disgusting and the system should be shut down.

http://chng.it/VLCvkqJx

Good for him. At least he can finally meet his icon, Reagan, in person once again.

Rush ended and there was a huge spike (I wonder why? 🙄)

He allowed in person boys rush

so many geeds

Hope they brought shorts

It’s all worth it though, gotta find your brothers. /s

Ah yes, the classic 'create reddit account and lie in wait for 6 years to bash the IFC and Greek system' play. I was making up a frat because the problem is systemic, I didn't want to single out any particular org. Bro not allowed to change his mind about the fraternity system after leaving UVa? We got away with a **lot** and would get a slap on the wrist \- I've seen racist-ass situations where brothers (let's say at other frats, never mine) are suspicious of black students trying to get into a party. \- I've had hundred year old antiques stolen out of my house (a clear violation of the honor code), and reported it to the IFC liaison to basically be told 'boys will be boys'. Like I don't even care that much about it, especially in hindsight, but it was apparently that IFC frats were given a huge amount of leeway and not subject to the same standards as the rest of the student body. No honor code trials here, not for the *good ol' boys* of the IFC. \- Hazing. We all know this is happening. It's *insane* that UVA would associate themselves with organizations that literally abuse 1st years and legitimize them \- The racial makeup of the IFC member organizations. I don't think I need to elaborate on this. &#x200B; Say I'm making all this up. It's still obvious that frats are a headache for any university. Why do you think UVa keeps them around? They're a huge liability, result in racism, classism, sexism (oh yeah, we used to brag about what girls we had sex with in our meetings and rate how hot they were, there was even an official joke position of a brother who had to report on all sexual activities within the house), and I bet lead to substance abuse more often than the general student body. The only reason they're still here is tradition and rich alumni.

3-0 in OT I have never seen more lucky bs from a single team 4 times IN A ROW in my whole life. Cardiac cavs strike again.

Dude morris needs to get a bionic arm we suck ass without him running every other play.

Were you around for the 2007 UVA FB season? We had some wild stuff that year.

I feel like throwing up. Cardiac Cavs strike again.

Was at this game. Talk about Cardiac Cavs; I could feel my heart beating in my chest! Waaaay closer than I would’ve liked, but glad we got the W

Good teams win ugly sometimes. A w is a w, D played well, O needs to step it up. Beli is a vg D coach so he had them ripping a bit

This team has a toughness and resilience that we haven't seen in UVA football for years. This was an ugly game that all too often, UVA would have lost in the past. Not this time. UNC played hard and got to give a shout out to Belichik for going for the win in OT with the 2pt attempt, but UVA's defense stopped it. This team's character reminds me of the 2019 NCAA Championship basketball team. They're on a run & let's hope it continues!

Absolutely need a new OC

Are we going to nationals ? what are the chances

Tony Elliot getting too much valor rn imo. this shit is all luck / Morris

That was the 48-0 win over Miami season

Very Similar vibes.

That year was one wild ride, but it ended in a rough bow game against Texas Tech. And it only took us 12 years to get our revenge for it.

Pretty sure we peaked with the safety after the wrong guy called for fair catch from this year.

This team has more offensive capability if you take away injuries, that team didn’t

Yep I watched every one of those 2007 games; the “Cardiac Cavs” was an appropriate nickname, and the comparison has been appropriate as well.

This feels a lot more fraudulent

How was the crowd and vibe at the game?

But do good teams win ugly every time?

Points totals: 48, 46, 30, 22, 17. Defenses have figured Des out. Will he adjust?

Nationals? Cmon bro

Definetly playoffs

Are you some Chinese bot?

He deserves praise for the mindset he's taught the players. None of them have any quit. If he can just get a real fucking OC...

Luck and Ws.

Yes, it was. Also the year we won 5 games by 2 points or less. 😂

in '23 we lost 4 games by 3 or fewer points. its kind of like if we had won those games instead except also not really lol idk.

That team had a fantastic freaking defense. This one… nah.

It definitely got more intense as the game progressed! The UNC fans were passionate but cordial. There was a good UVa presence too, which was cool. Really good experience

Sometimes that’s how it is. Good teams find a way to win

7-1 overall, 4-0 in conference I’ll take that all day and twice on Sunday or Saturday in this particular case

He has adjusted. He stopped running the ball with RBs and just called pass plays. That's the problem.

this is where a coach actually makes a different. all the rest is the players.

Who calls anything in football “nationals”. Very sus

They could be a first year foreign student so be easy. Having said that we’ll certainly qualify for the Olympics this year.

If you don't laugh you'll cry

Two days in a row we've had notable celebrities from my childhood die and shelter in place orders around UVa. I'm not saying they're connected, but they're not *not* connected....

Where the two criminals threatening people at UVA caught?

What does this mean? I don’t get it. Also a bad shooting at Old Dominion University in Norfolk right now

Neither targeted UVA students, faculty, or staff. Both incidents started off Grounds, and the only connection to the University in both cases was proximity. The second one, the stabbing, started in the church parking lot across the street from Memorial Gym, and the suspect never got on the grounds. The first started on Fontaine Ave, where a car stopped for an expired inspection sticker and involved someone wanted by state police on multiple felony charges. They fled in the vehicle, crashed on Ivy Road, and into the area near UVA. The bulk of the search was in surrounding neighborhoods. One security camera picture that looked like the suspect was walking along Alderman Road was posted. That subject has been managing to elude the police for several weeks and, as of Saturday, was still at large but not thought to be in the area. It doesn't help that multiple jurisdictions were involved in both cases, so there were excess alert messages if you subscribe to the multiple alert systems used by the local government and the University. The every 15-minute alerts seem excessive, but given the number of people complaining that they don't see them, I guess they are justified.

Oh, it doesn't actually mean anything. Gene Hackman and his wife dying has nothing to do with us not does Michelle Trachtenberg. Those are just the things that have dominated my social media feeds along with a million text alerts from UVa in the last couple days. And man, that's terrible about ODU. Is it over at least? Nobody is still running around hurting people, right?

Thank you for this

Two shot dead I don’t believe they were students. Someone was taken away in handcuffs not sure if it was the shooter but likely

I missed saliva testing & peed my pants I usually leave my apartment at 4:00 since testing closes at 4:30.I actually felt really motivated to get work done today, and I lost track of time and didn't realize until it was 4:15. I should've just rescheduled my appointment, but I decided that instead I would speed walk to CGG and hope that I get there before they close. I quickly put my shoes and mask on, start collecting saliva in my mouth, and leave my apartment. Half way there, my legs start hurting really bad since they were already sore from leg day. My throat starts getting super dry and my head starts hurting. I kept going though because I had already made it half way. Then everyone on the sidewalks was walking super slow and I couldn't get around them, so I had to walk on the WET, MUDDY grass in my new WHITE shoes. At this point I'm by clem and I have like 30 seconds to get to CGG. I'm so tired and out of breath that I end up getting there 1-2 minutes late. They aren't letting anyone in and I can't even explain what happened to them since I have a mouth full of saliva. I leave without getting tested and decide that's I'll just slowly walk back to my apartment. It's a nice day out after all. But I'm so sweaty from rushing to get to CGG and I can't even take my hoodie off because I'm no wearing anything. Half way back to my place, I suddenly REALLY need to pee. I had been drinking a lot of water all day and hadn't peed in like 8am. I rush to my apartment, crossing my legs and squirming all the way there. I made it. Except I drop my keys as I'm trying to open the door. At this point I have to pee so bad that I'm struggling to bend over to pick up my keys. I go to pick my keys up, and all hell breaks loose. There's piss everywhere. I shamefully enter my apartment, strip, and get in the shower. When I got out of the shower, I hear my roommates talking about how someone pissed by our front door. Fuck. I probably shouldn't post this but I really hope they don't have reddit.

> When I got out of the shower, I hear my roommates talking about how someone pissed by our front door. This fucking killed me. Did you just leave a massive puddle in the hallway? The way you describe it, it sounds almost like this is a normal occurrence. “Damnit. Somebody pissed by our door again.”

this could’ve stayed in the drafts hun

This is the making of a great copypasta

This is the same person that drank their saliva.

I’m a high school junior looking to get into this university and after opening the subreddit and seeing this, I’m so confused what to think about this prestigious establishment where people talk about piss...>!This is exactly why I need to get into this university, I fit in perfectly!!<

That’s rough, buddy

honestly i felt this energy lol

Then everyone on the sidewalks was walking super slow and I couldn't get around them, so I had to walk on the WET, MUDDY grass in my new WHITE shoes. At this point I'm by clem and I have like 30 seconds to get to CGG. I'm so tired and out of breath that I end up getting there 1-2 minutes late. They aren't letting anyone in and I can't even explain what happened to them since I have a mouth full of saliva. I leave without getting tested and decide that's I'll just slowly walk back to my apartment. It's a nice day out after all. But I'm so sweaty from rushing to get to CGG and I can't even take my hoodie off because I'm no wearing anything. Half way back to my place, I suddenly REALLY need to pee. I had been drinking a lot of water all day and hadn't peed in like 8am. I rush to my apartment, crossing my legs and squirming all the way there. I made it. Except I drop my keys as I'm trying to open the door. At this point I have to pee so bad that I'm struggling to bend over to pick up my keys. I go to pick my keys up, and all hell breaks loose. There's piss everywhere. I shamefully enter my apartment, strip, and get in the shower. When I got out of the shower, I hear my roommates talking about how someone pissed by our front door. Fuck. I probably shouldn't post this but I really hope they don't have reddit.

Is it really? Lmao saliva testing is wrecking this person

> I usually leave my apartment at 4:00 since testing closes at 4:30.I actually felt really motivated to get work done today, and I lost track of time and didn't realize until it was 4:15. I should've just rescheduled my appointment, but I decided that instead I would speed walk to CGG and hope that I get there before they close. I quickly put my shoes and mask on, start collecting saliva in my mouth, and leave my apartment. Half way there, my legs start hurting really bad since they were already sore from leg day. My throat starts getting super dry and my head starts hurting. I kept going though because I had already made it half way.

Probably not I just like thinking it is

Homelessness Recent CS graduate here, now currently homeless. I finished my undergrad with a decent GPA, two internships, and a few decent projects, but I couldn't find a job that I got this degree for. I tried networking at recruiting events and online, which helped me get to a few final rounds, none of which I have heard back from. I had the privilege of shelter from May up until two days ago where I was given the ultimatum and kicked from home. Between May and the day I was kicked I did nothing but work, leetcode, apply for jobs, network, and get yelled at every single day at home for being a failure (which I endured in exchange for shelter). The current opinion in this job market is that graduates are not entitled to a job, and that a degree doesn't mean jack shit. I do not agree or disagree with this, but it is ridiculous to expect mid-level skills from early career individuals, the entire point of early career programs is to hone graduates into people who will keep your company running in the future. We had been told from childhood that the way to higher income positions was to drain yourself in debt from college and get a job after that would pay off those debts. Now I am without a car, over five figures in credit card debt (acquired credit cards to pay for college since parents refused to, not that the University gave a shit), and cannot even work my retail job as I cannot drive to it or show up presentable. The reason I have no money is because it all went towards being able to live, use a car, and eat at home. I have no friends and family to reach out to for support. Genuinely, what am I supposed to do to survive? My situation has left me completely bitter, resentful, and has made me want to end it all. I have nothing left and no hope for a future.

Found a number you can call for help: 434-924-8255 [https://www.helplineuva.com/](https://www.helplineuva.com/)

I'm probably older than you (around 50). Please do not allow your emotions to overwhelm you and do anything drastic. What you are going through isn't abnormal. I was there, many years ago. It is scary when you first graduate from college, in debt, and cannot find your dream job. Take some deep breaths. You are going to get through this. You have a lot going for you, and you are going to be okay. I know it doesn't feel like it right now and you are upset, which is understandable. There has to be someone at UVA who can help you out. I don't know exactly who you can call at the moment but I wanted to type something right now.

it’s time for mutual aid 100%. uva mutual aid funds aren’t open but if you’re in charlottesville places like the beautiful idea and visible records have a free community fridge, as well as bath supplies you can use, as well as networks you can reach out through. what i would recommend is to make a small graphic listing your situation, and venmo/paypal for people to send funds to. circulate this through instagram and mutual aid networks. you can dm me if you’d like more information on this, i hope things change for you soon!

A lot of options in here, and someone else mentioned it, but I'd consider looking at the military. Maybe Air Force or Navy. Since you have a degree, you could even go to officer candidacy school. They might be able to help with student debt (but it sounds like yours is on CCs and not traditional loans, so maybe not). There are technical roles that you could look into and find something that hopefully leverages your degree/interests. Depending on what you do, when your service is complete you will probably have a security clearance of some sort which will open a lot of doors in the contracting space for the military/DoD/Govt. It might not be what you wanted to do, but it's pay, housing, and a pathway to a future.

Don’t knock the military. It’s an easy out and you have cybersecurity skills and they make bank. It doesn’t have to be your career and it can just be your way to your feet. I went through something very similar.

I'm so sorry. This sounds extremely difficult. From my perspective: many young people are applying in the exact same way, to the exact same jobs, based on very similar skills. Hence the off-scale number of rejections. This observation may not bring much immediate comfort, but: the situation is adverse for many young people right now. It's not just you, though it sounds like you do have some particularly difficult circumstances. I won't play online therapist, but I will offer this concrete suggestion: cast your line in very different waters, and try not to repeat the same patterns. If that means working on a farm and milking cows for while, so be it! Please consider taking yourself as far away from your present circumstances as you can, physically and mentally, and give yourself a break and chance to gain some perspective of what's going around us. If this means doing volunteer work or doing something totally unrelated to CS, so be it: cast that line far, as far as you dare. And for whatever it's worth, there is lovely Norwegian proverb: as long as your line is baited, there is always hope. Meanwhile, I'm happy to have a look at your resume and make suggestions on job applications etc.

I'm so sorry you're going through this. DMing you my email address. Please send me your resume and maybe we can find some work for you.

I’m at Google and I can review your resume and refer

This isn’t going to help with immediate housing and food insecurity, but region 10 has some resources and options for folks experiencing a mental health crisis. If things get worse before they get better, please give them a call before doing anything you can undo. I’m sorry you’re going through this impossibly difficult time. The world works much differently now than it used to even 5 years ago, job markets especially. It’s much harder and crueler. We endure the best we can, but everyone falls on hard times. Please take care of yourself.

Giving you a virtual hug. Try looking for govt jobs that have clearance level. Might be easier to compete against others.

With a CS degree you should probably start looking at enlisting in the military, specifically AF or Navy. A great place to stack bread and get some career experience

Have you tried couchsurfing.com? Happy to pay your fee to join, if that helps. There should be some people in C-ville who can host you. 🙂 Alternatively, Innisfree Village in Crozet *might* (no promises) be an option for food and housing... Their IT director might be glad for an intern (but I can't promise it), or you may be able to volunteer in another capacity. Also, do you know about The Haven in downtown C-ville? They may have more suggestions for you. I wish you all the best for your future! Edit: Just remembered that Innisfree also has two houses in C-ville where volunteers stay. Maybe ask if one of those might be a possibility for you?

Have you contacted the career services office at UVA? They assist graduates too. Likewise, can you reach out to a favorite former professor? They might have leads. You can also likely pick up work substitute teaching in schools as long as you can pass a background check. If you are able to teach math and science (and/or SAT prep), you can make bank tutoring private school kids. Maybe you can do freelance CS-related work on Fiverr? Housesitting/pet sitting, especially with holidays coming up, would give you a place to stay. Check out Rover. Or look for advertisements for people offering a room in exchange for looking after an elderly relative. You’ve got to get your housing squared away before it gets cold out. All of the above options would give you the flexibility to keep interviewing.

Hey OP, it sounds like you were illegally evicted.

Have you considered creating a go fund me for living expenses? I'm sure UVA alumni will want to help.

The one thing with the military is that you need to have a basically flawless past healthcare record especially with regard to any mental health issues (and they check medical claims and prescription records): things like depression, anxiety, ADHD are all disqualifying as are lots of other random things like asthma, eczema, recent broken bones, and of course any more serious health conditions. Many things are then waiverable on a case-by-case basis, but you won't know until you try. Just an FYI if you head down this route.

if you can dm me your email address, resume, and either the area you live in or area you would like to live in, i can see if there are resources or jobs in that area you aren't tapped into yet. i'm a uva grad school graduate who went to grad school precisely bc i couldn't get a job with only my undergraduate degree. i know it seems bad, but your situation isn't hopeless. there are good people who want to help.

Might be a bit late, but I’d recommend mass applying to any positions at the places you interned at, that’s what I did.

I work at Databricks. I graduated from W&M but saw this on my feed. Can you send me your resume?

Any family? Anyone? I’m so very sorry that you are going through this. Have you considered the military?

NGL this is why a lot of people go to grad school. Loan deferral + more loans to cover living expenses. Not saying it’s the right choice for you but it’s a thing people do. (If you do it, choose a cheap school in an area with a low cost of living. Preferably as far away from your shitty family as possible.) For credit card debt you may wish to contact a debt consolidation service. You’ll likely take a hit to your credit but you’re young. They may be able to negotiate a much lower payback than what you actually owe.

Join the US military. You will get three hots and a cot …and health care. You may even get to use your CS, writing, and speaking skills.

Join the army it will help you a lot

UVA grad here who has also been homeless post-grad. I echo what on redditor said. A church helped me get back on my feet. I am still rebuilding but more and more stable. Feel free to message me. I can see how I can help

What I am about to say is not telling you to not put your head down and tough this out But, you are not wrong. A society setting up a whole generation to fail is indeed what we are witnessing, and the intention to address it is just gradrupling down on "no really the instituions are just fine this is all fine don't worry things will magically work themselves out for you" - you should be infuritated to be listening to that while on the street. I really don't think there is a precedent in history for younger generations to be given the absolute middle finger like this by their elders - this is the kind of thing that collaspes societies, and when you use your own eyes and ears and look around at our country right now... its bad. Its really bad and we shouldnt pretend otherwise. It upsets me to just see people give you hotline resources instead of expressing any solidarity. I feel comfortable to tell you you probably should be dreaming of a guillotine ^(still funnel the rage into something productive)

It feels like there's something missing from this story. Your parents literally told you "get a job the second you graduate or you're out on your ass"?

lot of companies are hiring in norther va. where do you live

This too shall pass. I [found a housing resources guide](https://www.cvilletomorrow.org/there-are-some-100-programs-to-help-people-with-their-housing-in-charlottesville-and-albemarle-county-we-made-a-guide-to-them/) that might come in handy looking for shelters, affordable housing and rental assistance. Don’t give up! You will be surprised how help will find you from unexpected sources.

just curious on your general location there is a decent commuter bus option from staunton, waynesboro and more via afton transit, also great option if you are a bit closer is biking and charlottesville has a great place called community bikes helping people in need get affordable and safe transportation so depending look in to that, military as everyone else said is definitely a viable option and it doesn’t have to be forever but would definitely help you get back on your feet and provide structure (they also help create valuable connections) this isn’t some deep personal failure(even if ignorant people say it is) and I wish you the best of luck!

Prayers h011@

As others have suggested, check out Space force or Air Force . Just pop in to a recruiter and see what they have to say. It’s not forever (though it could be if you love it) and there are so many different opportunities for follow-on training and doing cool stuff. You could even end up with a clearance and that’s worth a lot. Best of luck to you!

https://www.peacecorps.gov/ways-to-serve/benefits-and-training/during-service/student-loan-information/ While serving, Volunteers are still responsible for any student loans they have. But, there may be benefits available to you, including deferment, partial cancellation, income-driven repayment, or forgiveness.

First off. Fuck your parents. Secondly, what was your degree in and what type of job are you looking for? I can ask around and see if anything i know is available

Jesus is your only real Hope, but he will provide anything and everything you need, find your nearest Catholic Church and seek the priests help

You could try to apply to the USPTO (Alexandria VA) once you have the ability to show up/look presentable. Job is hard (only like 50% of people make it past 1 year and it is not a “CS job”) but they are hiring afaik and it gets you income. https://uspto.usajobs.gov/job/846931800 Emphasize experience with AI on your resume and if you have a good gpa should be good to go.

Ex Navy here, mid-2000s, I can totally recommend Navy IT 'Rate' or job as it in known in civian life. Which will get you a good career in the Navy for 4 to 6 years, in networking & admin and a security clearance as well as connections to get a job after you leave in government or civilian IT career paths. IT is one of the best enlisted career fields in the navy. Air force has similar roles, great way to get started. see a recruiter.

If you are feeling suicidal and need mental health support there is also the 988 crisis line. Please reach out, they can also link you to other supports in your area.

CS grad ‘21 who couldn’t find a job chiming in. People who are saying join the military/public service are correct. I became a cop, departments are running accelerated hiring events and it’s easy to get in especially as a college grad. I make $100k+. The stem field is always there if you want to keep your skills up to date and keep putting out applications in the meantime. Best of luck! Edit: this may be an unpopular opinion here, but ICE is offering substantial hiring bonuses along with student loan forgiveness, that could go a long way in setting you up for the future.

Have you considered military service? There are loan repayment programs that might benefit you, Navy is currently offering up to 65k for your loans. It's not much but its something and I get the feeling that something is better than what you have now.

I have a BS in Biology and I’m a substitute teacher. It’s not too bad.

Are you in Charlottesville? I can put you in contact with a church there that is wonderful.

Join the military

Please contact UVA's Engineering Career Development and they can provide career coaching: [engineeringcareers@virginia.edu](mailto:engineeringcareers@virginia.edu).

There’s some things that don’t add up. Getting kicked out of home there has to be some reasons for that other than your simple perspective. You say you have networked at recruiting events but if you graduated from Comm School that is the pool that you should be networking with. Don’t you have friends you can network with or get some housing assistance? You may need to relocate to an area that is better for employment. Like someone mentioned, join the military for a two year bitch. Try real estate. You have to open your mind and accept entry level positions

Honestly, I’d look into ICE rn. Not the most popular but in your situation it is probably the fastest guaranteed fix you’ll get.

I’m so sorry to hear you’re in this position. So many of us recent grads are struggling to find jobs right now. I can’t even imagine the emotional toll this is taking on you, especially considering your family situation. Where have you been living/sleeping/keeping your possessions? UVA might be able to arrange some kind of housing or funding deal with you if you explain your situation. Idk. Maybe that’s naive. Mutual aid and looking into the military for sure. Do you have any experience with music/art/a trade/anything else you could monetize? Sending love and hope. You seem like a smart and resilient kid. It won’t be easy for a little while but you’ll be ok.

I guarantee you can get a construction job that will pick you up too. It's about willingness. An online application submission without a followup via phone or preferably in person is not applying for a job. There's a lot out there that pays well that people aren't willing to do because they think their degree makes them special and deserving of some BS work from home job

In a 2021 speech titled, “The Universities are the Enemy," JD Vance argued that "the professors are the enemy" and "universities do not pursue knowledge and truth. They pursue deceit and lies.” He added that, "we have to honestly and aggressively attack the universities in this country."

All these guys, Vance, Thiel, Musk, DeSantis, Miller, and even Trump have fancy degrees from top schools. They know the value, they just don't want you to have the same opportunities they did

Dude went to Yale, seems rather hypocritical.

Dude is such a fucking loser.

He’s a hypocrite. He wouldn’t be where he is today without Yale and he knows it.

I know the the collective “we” cannot stop sharing the details as to why they are such shitty people…but damn I’m so sick of having to see it at every turn.

This should com as no surprise. Despite his own Ivy League education, Vance wrote extensively in his book about Appalachia’s disdain for higher education. Anti-intellectualism is literally in his DNA.

There should be treason trials when all this is said and done

$100 says his kids go to college.

Thomas Edsall for the New York Times (6/3/25) - "JD Vance Wanted to ‘Aggressively Attack’ American Universities. His Wish Has Been Trump’s Command" https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/03/opinion/harvard-trump-vance.html

They are so frightened of an educated, reasoning class of people they will do anything to combat it.

Yup. This is what MAGA wants. People who didn't want Kamala Harris are responsible for this.

Weird, both of my advisors at UVa were Republicans.

Makes sense that a moron is against education

In 2021, JD Vance also called for the "de-Baathification" of America's public institutions, referring to the policy of purging the Ba'ath Party's influence after the invasion of Iraq and toppling of Saddam Hussein - *"We should seize the institutions of the left and turn them against the left. We need a de-Baathification program, a dewokeification program. Basically my strategy is to deinstitutionalize the left, reinstitutionalize the right."*

It’s all lies apparently unless he or the Mango Mussolini declare things to be truth. His wifes’s (Usha’s) parents, one an academic aerospace engineer and the other a career biologist, must be beside themselves at what their daughter married.

Is there anywhere we can organize to protect the university? I would love to join a Facebook or discord or anywhere we in charlottesville can plan to protect the freedoms of the students and faculty of the University. If one dosn't exist I would be interested in starting one, message me if you know anything or are interested.

JD Vance is spot on. The University “intelligentsia” (sic) are the core problem with the lack of true intellectual diversity on our college campuses.

He’s absolutely correct. That and the sororities pushing leftist ideals.

He couldn’t make it as a VC in Silicone Valley, he did manage to get up in Thiels ass

This is truly the stuff of nightmares... **The New Yorker: Curtis Yarvin’s Plot Against America (6/2/25)** *The reactionary blogger’s call for a monarch to rule the country once seemed like a joke. Now the right is ready to bend the knee.* [https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2025/06/09/curtis-yarvin-profile](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2025/06/09/curtis-yarvin-profile) Yarvin proposes that nations should eventually be broken up into a “patchwork” of statelets, like Singapore or Dubai, each with its own sovereign ruler. The eternal political problems of legitimacy, accountability, and succession would be solved by a secret board with the power to select and recall the otherwise all-powerful C.E.O. of each sovereign corporation, or SovCorp. ... “There are figures who channel a Zeitgeist—Nietzsche calls them timely men—and Curtis is definitely a timely man,” a State Department official who has been reading Yarvin since the Moldbug era told me. Back in 2011, Yarvin said that Trump was one of two figures who seemed “biologically suited” to be an American monarch. (The other was Chris Christie.) In 2022, he recommended that Trump, if reëlected, appoint Elon Musk to run the executive branch. On a podcast with his friend Michael Anton, now the director of policy planning at the State Department, Yarvin argued that the institutions of civil society, such as Harvard, would need to be shut down. “The idea that you’re going to be a Caesar . . . with someone else’s Department of Reality in operation is just manifestly absurd,” he said. In another timeline, Yarvin might have remained an obscure and ineffectual internet crank, a digital de Maistre. Instead, he has become one of America’s most influential illiberal thinkers, an engineer of the intellectual source code for the second Trump Administration. “Yarvin has pushed the Overton window,” Nikhil Pal Singh, a history professor at N.Y.U., told me. His work has revived ideas that once seemed outside the bounds of polite society, Singh said, and created a road map for the dismantling of “the administrative state and the global postwar order.” .... When I recently visited Yarvin’s Craftsman home, in Berkeley, I noticed a painting that Thiel had given him: a portrait of Yarvin in the style of a role-playing-game character card, bearing the legend “Philosopher.” As I sipped tea from a novelty mug featuring an image of Yarvin with a cartoon crown, he told me that it would be “cringe” for him to broadcast his relationship with Thiel—or with Vance, for that matter, whom he met through Thiel around 2015. “Does a normal Ohio voter read . . . Mencius Moldbug? No,” Vance reportedly said one night at a bar during the 2021 National Conservatism Conference. “But do they agree with the broad thrust of where we think American public policy should go? Absolutely.” “He’s a really cool guy,” Yarvin said of the Vice-President, who followed him on X earlier this year.

What should we do about tenure esp at public unis. It seems tenure has perpetuated the patriarchy esp cis white males. Maybe wholesale reform is needed? End tenure, pay profs better, use endowments to minimize tuition, reduce number of assoc deans?

Very lovely guy, throwing his family and region under the bus for political aspirations

Yes because she was democratically voted in as a presidential nominee. Oh wait, that didn't happen.

I’m curious what you mean by that. “Lack of intellectual diversity”. What would more diversity look like? I thought this whole mess was because Republicans didn’t like diversity.

Agree 💯… sad Reddit is such a woke, liberal echo chamber that prevents a good discussion

Do you think that’s what’s about to happen?

sorry you're still brooding over not being asked. there's zero question she'd be better than this shitshow. those of you still complaining about 2024 are responsible for this.

Your response reveals your bias and ignorance. I won’t elaborate beyond saying gave a great time playing in your myopic Progressive bubble.

Not brooding or complaining over here. For the life of me I can't fathom why you would support Harris unless it was only to vote against Trump. She is a complete puppet. I would just be trying to sweep her under the political rug just like Hillary Clinton.

Ah I should’ve guessed. The good ol avoid the discussion because there’s no real point. To be fair, I’d probably bow out too if I was in your position.

"i wont elaborate" Yeah we know you cant.

> only to vote against Trump why are you saying this like it's not the correct thing to do

>For the life of me I can't fathom why you would support Harris unless it was only to vote against Trump Turns out you could fathom why! And is wasn't that hard to!

OK here you go. Anyone with a moderate or conservative viewpoint is suppressed. I’m sure you think that’s BS. It isn’t. Google Morgan Bettinger (and her tormentor Zyahna Bryant) and Matan Goldstein. Ryan threw these students to the wolves, knew they were being persecuted, and did nothing. They both successfully sued UVA. Ryan is not a good guy. Any parent should despise him after what he’s let happen to those kids. Also, since October 7 antisemitism has been rampant. I am very close to the large and active Jewish parent group who have repeatedly gone to Ryan for help. He did nothing. You can choose to believe this or not. Ryan is superficially charming, bright, clever….and totally duplicitous. As the father of 3 girls, 2 of whom are UVA alumnae, I contend what he did alone to Matan and Morgan should have resulted in his termination. So, that’s my detained response. Now UVA needs to appoint a new President who protects all students regardless of their political or religious affiliation, and prosecutes those students (and faculty) who don’t.

I just did. Read it and weep. As former Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan said: “You are entitled to your own opinions, but not your own facts.”

Congratulations! 👍🎉😊

Wahoo! Very awesome OP! Good luck 👍

Congrats and welcome to UVA!

As if a degree actually means something these days…better to have the education behind the degree. Take classes you like and want to learn about. Don’t go to college just for a career at the end of the tunnel or you might miss the experience.

Wow congratulations 🎉

From the Mom of a 2025 graduate: well done!

Congratulations! My son is 11 and he’s thinking about this exact place and major. Update us on how you like it.🎊

WAH HOO WAH!

Congrats my guy. Please use your education wisely.

CONGRATS!!!

My son started with uva,med schooled for 6 years and landed back in uva health for his residency last year. Loves it

Couldn’t make it in engineering in Blacksburg, eh?

Congratulations!! I'm one semester away from finishing my graduate degree!! You got this!!

Congrats🎈🎈🎈🎉🎉!!!

What stats did you have to get in? Gpa, extracurricular, sport, etc. SAT?

Congrats. I wish I were as excited as you when I got accepted.

Not even the best school in the state. Go Hokies!

Thank you ❤️

I’m sorry for your loss

Thank you thank you ❤️

Imagine. Must be nice to fit in and be thriving at UVA.

Not sure if this has been posted, but can we get one of these?

that would ruin the fun, wouldn't it

We already have that overheight sensor, drivers would honestly ignore this too I feel like.

It would be more fun if they put it on the bridge.

Anyone hit the Curry School Bridge lately? When I was in Brown there was a betting pool on when the next truck would can opener itself on it. Seemed really common there for a while and then didn't happen at all my 4th year

ACTIVE ATTACKER NEAR EMMET STREET S UVA Emergency Alert: ACTIVE ATTACKER with knife W/M, red hoodie and blue sweatpants reported in area of 100 Emmet ST S, across from Alumni Hall. RUN HIDE FIGHT Received at 4:50pm

Last seen near Newcomb Hall

My brother is in class and says his class is in lockdown. Please stay safe everyone!!

According to the police broadcast, they think he’s on central grounds/main academic buildings at the moment

He’s detained

Police scanner has been reporting tips near central grounds and at least one person who has been injured. Do not go outside right now, lock or barricade doors

Sounds like one victim. They just found a red sweater in a trash can.

Everyone please make sure all of your doors are locked.

Scanner has reported that the suspect ditched the sweater and is no longer wearing it, they found it in a trash can ETA: It was found behind Halsey Hall

anyone know anything??

“They have him detained”

It’s over- UVA Emergency Alert: active attacker incident is stable. suspect detained. shelter in place is lifted. Police remain on scene. No further updates.

May have ditched red hoodie and now wearing white tshirt and blue sweatpants

Sounds like they got him?

Shelter in place is lifted. They caught the suspect

What is W/M?

Did they switch to a private channel? Scanner is quiet

Hearing it’s a female victim, currently in surgery. Possibly another victim, but not nearly as bad. If anyone has any info, please post.

Did they catch the other subject from the last lock down?

Victim is in bad shape possibly deceased according to scanner

Do they know where the attacker is now at least? Do they have a trace or anything? How can police not catch someone who is not even in a car

I’m tired of this grandpa

Now near 128 Amphitheatre Way

Suspect appears to be late 30/early 40

White Male, I think - correct me if I am wrong

Great time to make people confused to save a few letters

Oh damn I assumed it meant "woman/male". Thanks for asking this

yes, they switched over

My mom was in the ER and then ICU with my grandmother and thinks she saw the victim with a lot of police and doctors come in and quickly take them back for surgery. She just saw the same person post surgery being taken to a hospital room with police. Really hoping they are are okay and make a healthy recovery.

no as far as I know, but it's not the same guy

Hi which scanner is this? Alerts that I am getting doesn't say anything about a victim

I didn’t hear this- was it a student? Any more info?

Homeland security personnel on scene now too. K9 trying to track from hoodie

He ditched the sweatshirt behind Halsey Hall

The way I’ve been quoting that all week

![gif](giphy|n17lNDVf9Oik) That’s too damn bad!

Near RICE HALL now

Feeling Proud When I told my friends I was applying to UVA they said I would never get in, and to be frank I believed them to an extent. I was a good student, but I still had my doubts as I knew how selective this school was. Needless to say I was not very optimistic, but it was my dream school and I held out just a bit of hope. Finally on December 10th I got my acceptance letter. My face never went redder than it did then as I told my parents I got it. My parents always believed in me even when others didn’t. They were ecstatic, this acceptance held special significance for my family. I was the first person in our entire family to attend a college, my grandfather never completed fourth grade, my father only High school. I know the hard work has just begun, but for the first time in a while I’m feeling truly proud. I cannot wait to attend next fall. Wahoowa! (Sorry if this is coming off as braggy, just really happy rn!)

LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOOoooo Welcome to UVA!

Congratulations! Not braggy at all - you've earned this!

CONGRATULATIONS!!!!! honestly f*** your “friends” that didn’t believe in you, i’ll be your new friend! im also an incoming first year, can’t wait to see you on grounds next fall :)

Glad for you! Merry Christmas!

Welcome, and congratulations!!

Congratulations! Welcome to the Wahoo Family! Keep this feeling - this pride - with you for the rest of your life. Remind yourself of this moment when things get hard - and they will - and continue to look with wonder and optimism. We can't wait to welcome you to Grounds. Merry Christmas!

I was a first-in-my-family to go to college as well. Many congrats!

Welcome!! And Congrats!!

I am so proud of you and SO excited to welcome you to the UVA family. Wahoowa!!! Congrats and Happy Holidays!

Not braggy at all. Not to make this political, but this is what the American dream is all about. With hard work you can accomplish anything in this country. Those that overcome the most often have the greatest success. Congratulations on your accomplishment, you earned it!

As a fellow first gen, welcome Hoo!

Congratulations !!!

Congrats!!!

Wahoowa! Congratulations and see you on the grounds next year 😁

Congrats! So happy for you. You earned it!!

Congratulations and welcome!

Wahoowa! Can’t wait for you to join us.

You love to see it. Congratulations and know you’re coming to a truly special place, your hard work was worth it. Wahoowa!

Congrats, hope you love it here

Congratulations!!

Congratulations! That’s wonderful news! My son graduated from UVA last year. He had a fantastic experience, and I wish the same for you.

That’s so awesome!! Congratulations🥳🥳

Congratulations! You should be extremely proud! Make sure to properly celebrate!!!!

YAAAAAAAY CONGRATS SO PROUD OF YOU

Congrats!!! See you in the fall:)

welcome to uva!!!

Congrats and welcome! I’m CLAS 94, and I still remember my acceptance letter. It called me one of the best and brightest. Whenever I do something amazing, I remember it with pride. When I do something stupid, I remember it ironically.

WaHOOwa!!! Congratulations on working hard, believing in yourself, and getting in! Best school in VA! My son is a second year and absolutely loves UVA! I hope you have a wonderful adventure with continued success! Godspeed!!!!

you’re an icon! so glad you’re part of the family now❤️

Congrats, you earned this!!! Welcome to UVA!!!

your friends sound like they belong at tech. congrats hoo!!!

I am the first in my family to make it into UVA out of both my older siblings. My father attended but had to leave the country to take care of his dying parents. When I got my acceptance letter the first thing I thought was to go finish what he started. Excited for the fall!

Congratulations! That's a big step for you and your family

Lmao, most from my school go to tech. Not me😎

Minecraft Lawn Progress Pic (w/ shaders)

everyone get your naked skins on and we streak

Thought I’d update you all now that I finalized the Rotunda design, and installed a shader mod. Working on the Pavilions and will eventually work on Cocke, Old Cabell, and McIntire. I don’t want to spam this subreddit with pics so next time you’ll see me is when I’m done :)

host graduation on minecraft?

This is so cool omg!!! I tried to make a Rotunda design myself and just got tired before I finished lol. May I ask which platform you used (pc, switch, xbox?)

Why not just regular grass blocks?

Is this on a server?

We need a UVa server

Screw it. Just rebuild grounds. We’ll take classes via Minecraft.

this is dope

Is there raytracing going on? The lighting looks interesting.

Is this SEUS?

Hahaha! We’ll see, perhaps

Java Edition on PC

In my opinion it looked a little dull as a uniformly flat green surface

No this is a Singleplayer world at the moment

There is one! But there’s only like 5-10 active people lmao

I have an RTX graphics card but I’m not sure whether any ray tracing technology is working in the background for this shaderpack. I’ll look into that

I’m sorry, I don’t know what that is

As of now my plan is strictly the buildings bordering the Lawn, so any further construction will come after. This is currently a project I am working on in a Singleplayer world

You should add the giant disgusting pits of mud spread throughout the real lawn :)

How does one find this server, and are grad students allowed?

Sorry I was referring to your shaders. Do you know what shaderpack you’re using? Also not to be unoriginal but nice build! You’re not the first to do the Rotunda MC but this is definitely one of the better efforts I’ve seen. Good job!

Where should I stand on the realism v idealism spectrum lmao. I thought about making the muddy patches around the bases of the trees as large as they are in real life but for now I’ll keep them small and visually tolerable

Albino deer seen off JPA

I’ve seen it before also! It was running with several other deer and it was amazing! Thanks for sharing

thanks for sharing!

Saw this guy all the time when I lived on Shamrock Rd

i’ve also seen this deer living off of JPA! very cool!

yay they're back!

I seen a similar albino deer near wegmans last year, it may be the same one tbh

Nice photos!

How long do deer live? I saw one in the wegmans area about 10 years ago.

Corner Tonight - as an international student who had to go through a 14+7 days of quarantine and 24 hr+ connecting flights to just come back to uva I hope people in this pic realize how ignorant and privileged this is. Grow up and be responsible. There are other people in this world too.

This is just a ploy to distract us from buying more GameStop shares.

Because going out is much more important.

No surprise then that most professors are exercising their choice and deciding to teach safely online rather than share breathed air with these people. Professors live here in this community and social media and they see these grossly irresponsible things too. Additionally, the administration sees these things (and more!), so they kick the can further down the road before they can reasonably expect professors to teach in person again, because they recognize the extreme anti-social obscenity as depicted in this photo. Absent behavioral change — which can be driven by the administration as well as students — then Fall 2021 and Spring 2022 will be Zoom U all over again. Instead it seems both parties are choosing to fail.

Walked by Boylan height yesterday and it was way worse no social distancing and mask at all, sad face ://

What the hell l thought the bars were closed?

A friend took this pic and posted on their insta story and I asked for permission to post it here.

Yeah, it’s fucking ridiculous and makes my blood boil seeing them there

lol. i was driving up rugby yesterday and saw a stack of young ladies in tanktops and parka working their way down there. ya'll need to be careful.

We saw this at the start of last semester. Not sure I am surprised. But knowing this has happened historically what prompted you to return? I get the creepy crawlies just thinking of being a plane that long.

as much as these people are so fucking annoying and selfish, they probably have already had Covid (because they’re gross and nasty). does anyone know if Covid is still transmissible to other people through someone who’s already had it?

An overrated university trading on its past.

why I'm working remotely Exhibit A

Gotta get those cookies...

Jim Ryan is actually the CEO of Robinhood confirmed.

I think they’re going to insomnia ironically

Bars? They are in line at the DRUG store!

Giving mutations a chance.

I had a 13 hour time difference which means I had to take some classes at like 3am and others in my own day time lol. Those messed up sleep schedule rly gave me no productivity and motivation and I rly miss my friends here. then I saw Uva doing prevalence tests and taking actions so I really had high hopes in uva and people overall this semester.. it was not easy to convince my family to lemme back which is why I was particularly disappointed last night when I saw the pic.

what about the people who have to work and get exposed to them?

1. The corner is part of the Uva and Charlottesville community where there are so many people in the higher risk group. It’s not just about us students. 2. No vaccine hits 100% not to mention all those new variants. It’s no excuse to relax on precautions. 3. Never said I wasn’t privileged, but I’m aware of and grateful for everything I have and I’m careful with it. And I’m not putting others in danger just because I can.

Aren’t you like middle aged with a job? I see you all the time on the Charlottesville subreddit. Don’t you have something better to do than to comment continuously about FrEEdOm and how the virus isn’t all that bad on EVERY GODDAMN VIRUS POST in this sub?

Obviously this kid knows everything about epidemiology and infection prevention. It doesn’t matter that this is the “lowest risk group.” You can still be a carrier. Read a damn medical journal for your stupid feeble minds to “liberate” yourselves

Have you ever seen them in the same room together?🤔

FWIW, this happened during the first semester and there was little impact with our rates remaining very low compared to the state. The big jump in VA seems tied to Thanksgiving and Christmas. If memory serves, the semester ended pre thanksgiving, with pretty solid testing before released on grounds student and decent random off ground testing. It does not seem like much of the big Christmas spike could be placed on the students. We had a daughter in law who went a birthday party 12/22 at her families house. Saw the pics on facebook. Looks like around 20 people from 4-5 families. Then one of the people at the party discovered they were working with a positive tested person. I think it is more than crap than students. And honestly, I would not be surprised if their was some herd already in this group. Six weeks from now when the weather is clearing, the vax starts to get deeper the end will be in sight. Until then, take it from this old guy with lots of kids and grandkids: never underestimate the stupidity of kids in crowds. Good luck.

You know these fucking kids don’t give a shit about others

guilty. im also an alumnus and member of the charlottesville community and i dont think this place is supposed to be exclusively for students.

yup absolutely Fuck UVA and these students, but it’s a good school it’s cute when folks try to talk shit usually they don’t have much appreciation for higher ed in general coming from VA i basically could not have possibly realistically gone to a better school, it’s nothing to sneeze at

Good to know lol thank you sir

>Six weeks from now when the weather is clearing, the vax starts to get deeper the end will be in sight. Ummm... most faculty (unless they are 65+ years) are in vaccination group 1C , and in that group, those professors come after construction workers, fast food workers, and other people deemed more "essential." Your six weeks forecast seems crazy optimistic.

The restrictions should end when we have data showing deaths, hospitalizations, and community transmission have all returned to pre-pandemic levels. Getting 70-90% of the population vaccinated will help. So will doubling down on the current precautions.

I do believe in vaccine and in fact I’ve received two shots of vaccine in my home country. But we know so little about the virus variants or how long the vaccine will remain effective, so I don’t think at least for now we should use vaccine as a reason to “go back to normal”. Not to mention so many people, especially those in higher risk group, have not received the vaccine or have received the vaccine long enough (35 days since the first shot) for it to be working. and tbh I can’t wait for most of us get vaccinated I hope that happens before May so that we could have some normal in person experience:((

THis may be a hot take, professors are exactly in that category. They absolutely should stack up after fast food workers, who have to interact with tons of people and have little resources other than to work in that crappy job. Chances a professor is sweating and frustrated for 8 hours a day? Same with construction workers. They keep the economy rolling far more than a professor does and have to interact with a lot of people who may/may not be strongly focused on their bubbles. Many are lower income, rural and/or immigrant with limited resources. But I stand by my thinking that in 6 weeks the end will be in sight. Vax mess will be cleaning up, springtime will get people outside, positivity rate has dropped from 8.3% to 6.8% in last week alone. Did not say it will be the end, just that I think we will be seeing it much much closer.

I made a change to the logo on this sad day for my hometown.

u/jakevanyahres Would you be willing to allow us to use your icon in the circular icon of the subreddit? We would credit you in the sidebar.

Hearts with you guys from Cornell ❤️

Thank you for sharing. Love the heart

WE BEAT DOOK

The looks on the duke kids’ faces…just priceless. God, I love everything right now

Cardiac Cavs! Wahoowa.

This will be an everlasting memory for this team. It’s great to see the continual improvement in these guys.

I went to UVa and my son is going to Duke. Sure thing I will rub it in when he calls us this weekend :)

Love watching the Dook Dorks go from hands in the air to surrender position so quickly. DBR boards melted down.

Quick update on UVA

my grandparents still don’t have the vaccine chill y’all

I don’t get if

tell them to pull up then /s but no fr the people who run the danville clinic told people to show up bc they’ve been throwing out vaccines every day. plus more people getting vaccinated actually keeps old/at risk people safer

This is a map showing the locations of this person's friends/other uva students. They are all in Danville, VA, because they are trying to get a vaccine. The Danville pharmacies have been throwing out a lot of vaccine doses that are no longer viable, so they asked people in surrounding areas to please come sign up and use those otherwise wasted doses.

>wing the locations of this person's friends/other uva students. They are all in Danville, VA, because they are trying to get a vaccine. The Danville pharmacies have been throwing out a lot of vaccine doses that are no longer via Where online are the pharmacies asking people to sign up?

You don’t have to sign up, the clinic is accepting walk ins

PSA: How to to use the sidewalk in groups of 3+ on Grounds

LOL this is literally my biggest pet peeve at UVA. This happens everyday when I walk to class and I always have to go on the street because there are friend groups taking up the entire sidewalk.

Gonna have to dumb it down more for some people, not all of them are visual learners 💀

Omg this literally happened 2 hours ago at Snyder tennis courts. Exactly like the first diagram, I was walking on the right side of the sidewalk toward a group of 3 guys and they were taking up the whole sidewalk. I decided to stand my ground so I kept walking and at the very last possible second the edge guy scooted in but still brushed my shoulder. I turned around and gave the disappointed parent look but he didn't see 😂

The trick is instead of moving out of the way, stop completely. It looks like you’re being courteous, but really if any one of them runs into you while you’re stopped it’ll make them look like the asshole 100% for not moving out of the way. Most people will move

Brings back a UVA core memory. Combine that with the group walking at the speed of continental drift, spread entirely across every inch of the pathway, and you got it.

I was running over the Emmett Bridge one time and a group was coming at me and because I'm not going to jump over the bridge, I tried my best to sneak in the smallest crack in the group. The smallest guy walking took a shoulder so hard from me unintentionally... I'm like y u no move behind your friends?

Yesss! I’ve never had this problem as bad as it is at UVA. Props to my peeps who make space to the other people walking

Yes well please generate the version of this diagram in which one is bisected by a bicycle or one-wheel or electrified skateboard. On a pedestrian walkway. In the scenario you depict, there is at least some time to plant your feet and gird your loins.

i find that if i stare straight ahead and walk with a purpose they will move out of the way for you but if you seem timid, they won’t and expect you to move out of the way for them

This is so cute

But I’m tired of being the third person in the back left out of the conversation :(

And as a bike commuter, I've almost nailed so many people for stepping into the bike lane without looking. Or I swerve into traffic. The domino effect is real.

It's called planting your feet and taking the charge

Go to Honolulu. The male Japanese tourists walk 4 or 5 abreast at a pretty good clip. They also NEVER move out of the way.

Make a power play and move to the front

Lead the charge

Cavalier Daily Editorial Board: "As it stands, students will be returning to Grounds with no concrete sense of who will be at the helm of this institution and little reason to trust the governing body, which has made no attempt to explain or justify its actions."

Students should recognize they're not governed by people looking out for them or the quality of their education. UVa's growth over the last 30 years is prolific and the charlottesville area has grown with it. A fundamental adjustment in leadership's aims and attitudes from generative to exploitative is about to happen and greatly impact both. Stay vigilant.

Sorry, UVA, you forfeited your definite article, you are now just A University of Virginia.

When I was in school I didn't care one bit about any of this stuff. I just wanted to get my degree and be with my friends.

When I was in school the president wasn’t a pedophile

That’s kinda WHY it’s important. Competent leadership lets students be students. They also deserve what you got.

I’m sure it’s easy to be that way when you’re not an international student, on financial aid, doing research, or looking for an internship/job within NOVA while being at UVA right now. Visas are being cancelled, financial aid is murky for next year, scientific and academic research such as in cancer research is being cut (about $90 million), and the once reliable NOVA job market is completely messed up due to the instability of having an incompetent leader. That’s not including anything about DEI. So yeah, your fellow Cavaliers are having their career paths altered severely, with some not might being able to finish college here. This is not high level or small as you think. There’s plenty of folks concerned here and already lost opportunities. A typical Republican administration is not this incompetent. Interesting enough the MAGA folks here in UVA are more quiet. Perhaps we need more people to feel the consequence of what they voted for. Too bad the rest of us get dragged in. Vote Spanberger this fall.

When you’re not a white man studying engineering, politics are much more important to pay attention to.

cool story bro

The fact that you think: - Being able to afford college - Being able to attend here as an international student - Gaining research experience - Gaining internship experience - Landing a job afterwards Is NOT part of a person’s education - makes me wonder how badly you want to believe this is a high level culture war as opposed to a serious - and manufactured - crisis for college students. Or perhaps you’re out of touch.

I have worn the honors of Honors… ...I graduated from Virginia. Congrats to everyone who walked the Lawn this weekend! It's been an unforgettable 4 years.

Congratulations and welcome! If you haven't received it yet, your “please donate” letter is probably already on its way. It's yet another UVA tradition, I think. I hope you remember the years and friends you've made for a lifetime as fondly as I have.

4655 undergraduate degrees were awarded this weekend. I had the privilege of reading out around 700 of those names to walk across the stage between the BACS and BSCS degree ceremonies (\~15% of all undergrads). Please, oh please, remember all the wonderful experiences and learning over the past four years... and forget if I mispronounced your name :-) WAHOOWA!

Congratulations!! Ugh that’s such a big achievement!! Can’t wait till I walk the lawn 🥲

Congratulations!!

Congratulations!

Fantastic and congrats! Two years ago my daughter walked the Lawn as my mother and I (both UVA alums) watched. Three generations of Hoos, it was a very special day…

Congrats and Wahoowa!

The first and last song you sing at dear old UVA.

Aww I graduated from UVA on 5/20/2001a chilly cloudy day! Not warm today either!

Congrats!!! 🧡💙🧡💙🧡 - CLAS 03

*honors of Honor

You're so lucky!!! I wish I could've graduated this year. Except It would've been a forgettable 4 years for me.

I hated my time here yet I'm still sad

4th year giving - the “tradition” is to donate before you graduate. This starts off the giving cycle.

Ah, yes, one of the most venerable collegiate traditions. 48 hours later, my “please donate” email has arrived! I eagerly wait in anticipation for my monthly letters to start pouring in :)

what is donate your letter?

OMG!! FINALLY!!! Another person who has also hated their time at UVA. This is a miracle. This school sucks and the fact the people here have UVA shoved so far up their a\*\*es is insane. This school is not all it's hyped up to be and is a horrible school. The elitist, undiversified environment sucks!!! I HATE UVA.

The foundation and alums association often ask people to join and donate to support the University. I used to joke that they must mail the letters before the ink on the diplomas is dry. UVA isn't unique - most colleges and universities do the same thing. It is practically a cliche. But if you found a UVA program that significantly improved your experience and want to keep it strong for future students, consider donating when possible. Dealing with loans, grad school, or forming new families and careers can be hard. It was about ten years after graduation before I thought I could donate anything, let alone anything that might make a difference to other students.

You don’t deserve to graduate from UVA with that attitude honestly

JMU double-grad here (‘16/‘19)— they had a donate flyer in the tiny scrolls handed to us as we crossed at graduation. Both times. 😂 congratulations, regardless!

I do deserve it, actually. My bad for not having UVA spirit shoved so far up my a\*\*. Did you know that some of us don't like it here and that not all of us manage to have a good time here? Some of us hate/hated our time and experience here, something none of you seem to be able to comprehend because UVA is just the greatest school ever, right? Everyone should love it, OMG!! Yeah, no. It doesn't work like that. Most of us who don't like it here weren't privileged enough to thrive in this stuffy, elitist, undiversified environment like you might have been able to.

I would sympathize. But every suggestion made to improve your experience at UVA has been rejected as too much effort. You expressed a sense of entitlement that people would seek you out while you sat in the dark gaming. I hope you find a place you feel you fit in eventually, but that won't happen without you breaking out of your shell.

IHOP - raccoon stole someone’s food at Shea House 😭

Damn that’s my food! Just finished complaining to my girlfriend who the heck steals food at winter night…oh well, I hope them enjoy bacon

The honor code is dead

My man was VIBING. omfg im so drunk and this shit is so funny

omg he looks so chonky and fluffy, I wanna pet him

Why is it so hard to actually call us and have us come out instead of putting the food on the ground, like I’ve had two deliveries that they just put the food wherever and didn’t call me

Honestly so cute hard to be upset 😂

should have known better when I noticed the drink is left untouched lol

Because people take forever to come out.

Just be prepared when the driver arrives. Simple.

How often do you answer unknown numbers on your phone?

I get that, I was an AM at Domino's for 2 years before starting college again and I know it's different for Doordash but a phone call is important so that we actually get the chance to come out instead of having our food left on the ground for whatever to happen to it. If someone doesn't answer, then that's a different problem ofc and I wouldn't blame the driver at that point.

I always am and there is no call, no call in my call history. They just take the picture of the food for their app and go.

I mean if I've ordered food, I'll probably be expecting an unknown number calling me to tell me my food is here, no? If I miss the call it's on me but it doesn't feel unreasonable of a request

Exactly. You should be paying attention to the notifications from the app. You’ll get one as soon as the pic is taken.

Sure but there's a lot that can happen, not to mention that a call is much more attention grabbing than a notification. I get that there's a lot of people who are completely oblivious but to never call a single customer ever is just being lazy.

The couriers can’t waste a single minute on any customer in the current market. If too much time is wasted, they may as well have just stayed home. Time adds up.

Mate, you literally have GPS tracking with second by second updates of exactly where the person bringing your food is, also with automatic text messages warning you when they get close so you can check. Why are you complaining that these overworked and underpaid people aren't standing around outside your place to also give you a phone call on top of all of that, when time is literally money for them? You're literally saying that you need them to take more time to grab your attention so you can be free to just ignore all of those other tools, but still get your food the moment it shows up. And if they don't they're the lazy ones. Maybe reflect on that, because you sound a little bit awful.

me when my camera is off during class

lmao y'all are wearing undies during class? commando is the way to go

POV: You missed prevalence testing

I...I was just sleeping in late 😳

FUCK, thanks for reminding me. I still have an hour and a half left.

I can’t make my specific time slots usually so I’ve been getting away with going an hour or two after or even a day early/late. as long as you get the test I don’t think they care tbh

Hey... pssst.... here’s a little secret: they don’t really check if it’s your time slot or not

I'm tired of the gathering limit double standard between frats and the rest of UVA Frats were allowed to hold in person events over the weekend even though the gathering limit was 6 people. Having people attend rush and bid events in shifts is meaningless when the people running the event are common between shifts. In the end, it amounts to one big gathering. There was literally no reason to allow bid stuff to happen in person but UVA let it happen anyway, and now COVID cases are spiking and all gatherings are banned. The community is suffering because UVA let frats be an exception to a good rule for no reason. I'd love to hear Jim Ryan explain why UVA let frats ignore the rules to the student body and all of Charlottesville. But of course, special treatment for greek life, right? Classic. If we want to see any change, we need to walk up to admin offices and protest.

70% of donations to UVa come from alum who were in greek life... money talks

I emailed them about this and the response was what you would expect-- the frats and sororities had rules to follow and we are apprehending the ones who didn't follow the rules. Which, doesn't really seem to be the case to me as the rule breaking has been going on for weeks now. Also, not quite sure why they still didn't mention Greek life in their new restrictions update because its pretty clear why the cases are starting to spike.

Tbf no ones parties are really getting shut down by the school, frats or otherwise. People I know are still having house and apartment parties (not Greek affiliated) every week. If UVA gave a shit they’d cancel rush and crack down on parties. They prolly realize a majority of these kids will be fine and won’t spread it to the elderly

how do we make a change?? who should we complain about this to because this shit is fucked up

If you want to be angry at someone be angry at Dean Groves and ODOS. The IFC and ISC are student run organizations, therefore, they needed to have meetings and permissions from the administration in order to proceed. By allowing the IFC and ISC to lift their ban on gatherings for the express purpose of rush, the administration is almost solely responsible for the usual market based competition that ensues for a limited supply of people at 31 fraternities and 16 sororities. Further, everyone looks at the first years as the victims of this process, they are partly complicit, most places that I know of had virtual and in-person plans for action, but those who had both at the same time saw their "clients" (being first years), continually show up at those events in-person and choosing to forgo the virtual ones (not sparing any blame for the orgs, but at this point it is beating a dead horse). Again this is all based on the decision by the ODOS and those in negotiation with the IFC and ISC to cave. Finally, instead of being angry at a double standard, let's be more angry at this blatant attack on civil liberties of individuals (I can accept 6 or 5 people gatherings, even 2 or 3, but now people in relationships can't technically hang out because of they are not of the same household give me a damn break).

Also emailed Dean Groves begging him to cancel fraternity rush and telling him that no one was going to follow the rules. His response was that they were taking all the necessary precautions and told me how I could report people who were breaking the rules :(

Sign this petition for non compliant IFC and ISC orgs to face further consequences https://www.change.org/p/university-of-virginia-suspend-uva-non-compliant-ifc-and-isc-organizations-until-the-end-of-the-semester?recruiter=664819874&recruited_by_id=7d1e15f0-db27-11e6-9686-b33408ee5b96&utm_source=share_petition&utm_medium=copylink&utm_campaign=petition_dashboard

let’s be clear, this was mainly frats. There’s such a double standard for sororities and it’s incredibly sexist. thanks Dean Groves!!

It’ll be ok in the long run.

get used to it

The first day was completely virtual

65% of stats are made up. Where did you get this info?

oh absolutely this ^

Was about to say JPA has been loudly bumping

I'm honestly tired of seeing all these dorm parties on people's stories! It's crazy cuz they'll be the same people mad at the frats for partying as well. HYPOCRISY. NO one should be partying in the first place! We're in a pandemic!

Report them!! That's why we have reporting tools.

The apartment above my throws a party three nights a week. They threw a party last night despite the new restrictions because today is a break day.

how exactly do u figure most won’t spread it to the elderly? as much as i sometimes fantasize about students and the greater community (me) not mixing, it’s not the case

Yep that was the response I got!

The entirety of frat rush was in person (at least partially), including the first day. Wineries were packed the past two weekends.

And the spike, which started last week, is coming 10-14 days after students returned to dorms and classes... It's probably been made worse by rush but I think Greek life is the scapegoat for a) a natural, expected spike and b) partying/going to bars by all students, not just Greeks.

Incubation period can be 2 days to 2 weeks.

someone is so narcissistic that they believe everybody wants to pay to have friends

In-person rush events were taking place for a couple weeks leading up to Sunday’s bid day. Not even trying to be the typical IFC hater on this subreddit but it’s honestly ridiculous to try and pretend that in-person events had no bearing on the spike

I think you're probably a bit right but we managed to keep cases low last semester so that suggests rush exacerbated the problem. Plus, I've heard from RAs that it's mostly their residents who rushed who are testing positive

Ok so rush over zoom. There is no need to meet in person, I didn't get to see my grandfather before he died because of covid, frats can deal with not doing coke together in person for one fucking season.

what the fawk 😀🥰✨

Lockin' it down

My emt roommate told at least 10 people have had to go to the hospital for alcohol overdose tonight 😕

Can’t wait for all of us 30-year-old grad students to get restricted again because of stupid 21-year-olds.

well that’s disappointing

That’s just the side entrance to hackcville they just tryna get jobs, don’t judge

Coupes is asking for a big ass fine.

How tf are the bars allowed to be open

r/iamatotalpieceofshit

Just shut it down

Live in an apartment right next to here. Can confirm it seems to be a normal night of partying 😅✨

Are we just gonna talk about how disappointing this is or should someone actually submit a report with this photo?

the title is about the guy in the jets jersey, right?

Wow college students are not that bright.

What else do you expect STAB kids to be doing on a Friday night?

not the sombreros 🥴

bruh moment

Cops should shut this down

Coupes be Coupes.

This looks like an egregious violation of the 10 person gathering limit. Does anyone know how strict UVA is being/has been on this policy??

notice how there are no poc 🤭🥰

Honor Code much?

Is anyone here surprised?

wtf are some of them wearing

I forgot it was Halloween I thought that girl was just dressed like a hooker..

I see that CD is still the epitome of corner class 15 years later...fuck, I’m old.

Is it really that hard to mind your own fucking business? You took time out of ur day to take a photo, and upload that photo to Reddit. LEARN TO MIND YOUR BUSINESS B!TCH

You guys created the system of oppression against black people

Stupid 18 yr olds **

Why should we put our lives on hold? Better yet, why should you? We need to balance not being hermits and shut-ins with responsible safety measures

Free market capitalism

Shut down what exactly? The bar or UVA?

They’re probably smart but very selfish

Can you prove my cost benefit ratio is greater than 1 for partying? Show me the math. I fully understand the risks of covid and partying outweighs the risk for me.

Underrated comment. This is a short line for a normal Tuesday, sadly (I know it’s Friday and you should know it’s halloweekend) Edit: Hallow not hollow

What is a STAB kid?

Sounds about yt

Wow there's totally a potentially Asian jedi next to the silver space cadet girl!!

yts stay reppin🥰

I was surprised at how many clothes are being worn.

Wow, you suck.

hey mister sir, everything is ok !! deep breathes 😌✨💅hating is a disease get well soon xoxo

Me too, unfortunately. I’m not a rule Nazi or whatever, but some common sense goes a long way.

Because thats what people who arent spoiled little narcissistic babies do for their country and neighbors. Ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country. Luckily, most young people aren't spoiled little babies, who give back for the great life america afforded them instead of reeeeeeeeing about himself and his life. Poor baby can't go to a bar. What a snowflake. You don't like sacrifing go to some middle eastern oil kingdom and get a rich person visa. We see you reeeeeeing in politics ❄. You don't seem to like a lot about america even though your man in office (not for long). Maybe its time to pack up and move.

Book smart but no common sense or street smarts (ie selfish)

STAB = St. Anne's Belfield, a local private school. Bunch of high school locals with fakes in line

If UVA caves to this administration's demands, it will face the same reputational damage that Columbia has already suffered. This is a moment for courage, conviction, and moral leadership.

Caving is an invitation for further exploitation. Trump pursues submission, he doubles-down on it because it’s not about the issue, he just likes winning. Tell him to fuck off and he’ll find some other group to target that WILL give him a win.

**This is a consequential and dangerous moment.** According to the New York Times, "This is the first time the administration has pushed a university to remove its leader." If you haven't already, please consider signing the Wahoos4UVA petition in support of President Ryan: [https://www.wahoos4uva.com/take-action](https://www.wahoos4uva.com/take-action) Also, please consider emailing members of the UVA Board of Visitors and demanding that they support President Ryan and stand up against the Trump administration's attempts to force his resignation. You can also email President Ryan to express your support. [https://bov.virginia.edu/contact](https://bov.virginia.edu/contact) [https://president.virginia.edu/contact](https://president.virginia.edu/contact) Finally, please reach out to your elected representatives (both local and statewide) and ask them to stand up against the Trump administration's attempts to stifle and crack down on higher education, academic freedom, and opposition. Find Your Representatives: [https://www.commoncause.org/find-your-representative/](https://www.commoncause.org/find-your-representative/)

I agree. It is make or break time. UVA has already stood up to the anti-DEI crowd. While the record is not spotless (think back to the free palestine protest quashed by state police last year), UVA is in a unique position to deliver on its promise to students and families.

I just called the office of the president and told the little girl we supported them. That Thomas Jefferson’s university didn’t bend the knee to any tyrant and we had their backs. Poor thing nearly broke down crying thanking me. Call them. Call the Alumni office, call the president’s office, call the board of trustees, call your delegate, your senator... CALL EVERYONE YOU KNOW. Call bullsh-t on this bullsh-t. And for gods sake don’t criticize—let people know we’ll support them in holding the line.

I’m so disappointed in my Alma mater.

Gov Youngkin and his new board. Gov. Youngkin appoints four new members to UVA Board of Visitors https://share.google/CqdTxyK4q78htTTvi

Hold the Line UVA! It maybe that you’re doing it for American academia.

Just read the President Ryan has tendered is resignation 😞 https://apple.news/AYKqB_9gNRH2bTdEbd6aHRw

The biggest threat is UVA getting the New College treatment.

Sadly they’re no Harvard.

Jim Ryan showed the world what a coward he truly is. Chose money over doing the right thing. Sad!

FYI, here's the Wahoos4UVA official website, where you can sign up to their mailing list and read about their mission statement and advisory council members: https://www.wahoos4uva.com/ You can also read more about Wahoos4UVA in this recent article in the Cavalier Daily: https://www.cavalierdaily.com/article/2025/06/resetuva-wahoos4uva-express-polar-views-on-university-leadership

Done. And I left a message for Youngkin, too. This is infuriating! Thanks for your post.

Especially with an endowment as large as they have ($14B). They could use 1-2% of the endowment to compensate for the withheld federal funding, but they wont.

Gator here. So much solidarity.

Hokie here. Totally behind you, Wahoos. I am posting how proud I am of your Memorial for Enslaved Labor MEL. Stop the hate and use diversity as a global leverage point

Please stop loudly packing up your stuff when the professor is still talking and class hasn’t ended. It is so disrespectful, it distracts them and many seem too shy or non confrontational to say anything. You’ll be fine waiting an extra 30 seconds.

People standing up, books closing, papers rustling, sounds of zippers zipping, butts shuffling out of chairs, people inevitably starting to talk, jeez. It's like you are subliminally telling the professor, "Thank god THAT'S over!"

It seems like things never change! That used to piss me off so much. I mean, what's the hurry, really?

A guy can dream.

Thank you. For those of you saying, FFS, I have a 15 minute walk…this comment isn’t aimed at you. You sit at the back of the class and leave respectfully when you need. It isn’t hard.

yall are a bunch of ass kissers here, i’m packing bc my next class is a 10 min walk away, and they’re literally middle aged adults who’s been doing this for years so if it really bothers them, it’s up to them to install a class policy

you’re gonna be so miserable in the real world if you think you can just demand people stop doing things that don’t harm you at all.

Unfortunately this school loves to hire incompetent educators.

To get to my next class that starts in 10 minutes

Middle-aged?

my thing is why does someone care enough to post about it? like it’s not hurting ANYONE.

Good luck if this is how you act once you enter the workforce.

Why does that preclude you from being quiet and respectful while the teacher is finishing up though?

Wait 30 seconds longer to pack up, and then walk *slightly* faster.

i’m not acting any different other than packing up 2 mins early w minimum sound disruptions as possible, it’s not that deep lmao? and i’d be fine getting fired or leaving if a company i work for is as neurotic as this

Why doesn’t the professor respect my time and finish on time. The next professor won’t appreciate me walking in 5 minutes late.

What if they’re going over for more than a couple minutes, then I’ll be late to my next class. You can’t guarantee it’s only gonna be 30 seconds

The problem isn't with packing up early, it's with people who seem to not be able to do it silently.

But is etiquette to do it loudly with no regard to others in the meeting???

The post said class hasn’t ended? Unless I’m misreading what you said, you’re talking about something completely different.

If the professor goes over, then that's on them and you're free to leave imo. I thought the post was addressing the people who loudly pack up at 12:49 while class is still going.

Good point, it appears this post could be in reference to packing up before class is over. I agree you should wait until the official end time before packing up Guess it depends on how you interpret “class hasn’t ended”. Does class end when the professor stops talking or at the allotted time? I for one think it ends at the allotted time.

Agreed, class ends at the allotted time!

Dr. Masashi Kawasaki has passed away in a car accident UVA Biology has lost another member. Please be kind to one another and remember how fragile life is. If he’s touched your life, please share your thoughts at the links. He will be deeply missed. https://bio.as.virginia.edu/masashi-kawasaki-1955-2025 https://padlet.com/taylordouglasr/remembrances-of-masashi-kawasaki-4etd0cwcu6pza9sz https://cvillerightnow.com/news/208802-students-and-colleagues-remember-35-year-uva-professor-who-died-in-a-may-18-madison-co-traffic-crash/ https://www.cbs19news.com/news/charlottesville-man-identified-as-victim-in-madison-county-crash/article_a248e178-123e-46d6-a349-2e934bae8c64.html

R.I.P Dr. Masashi Kawasaki. You were an incredible researcher. 🥺

I didn’t know him personally, but I am helping look after his fish until a more permanent solution is done, and you can just tell he loved these animals, and was passionate about his research. I’ve heard nothing but great things I wish I could have met him. May his soul rest in peace.

Honored to have taken his animal behavior class and to have listened to him play bass in the Charlottesville Symphony this past Spring semester. Such a kind and gentle man. He will be missed.

This sucks beyond anything else I've come across today and I've come across a lot of bad shit today. I had Professor Kawasaki back in 1995 for Animal Behavior class. Bar none, it was my FAVORITE biology class in my curriculum. He was so engaging and made the class so fun and interesting. I can't say that about all the other professors I had then. Such a shame to go out like that. I'll be praying for his loved ones. RIP Professor K. Say hi to my hamster up there who I adopted from your class after a lab session. 😞

Albemarle County, Greene County, and Madison County need to step up law-enforcement big-time on route 29. The highest speed limit anywhere on that road is 60 mph and there are several 45 and 55 zones. Nobody obeys this- they need to hire hundreds of deputies and officers who do nothing but 8 to 12 hour shifts of ticket after ticket after ticket after ticket. If you’re going 80 or above, you need to spend a couple weeks in jail. RIP, Sir

Rest in peace Dr. Kawasaki🙏 You will be missed

I started my UVA career in Biology and Dr Kawasaki was such a kind man. This is an incredible loss to Biology, UVA and the greater scientific community.

Didn’t know him personally either but willing to help out if needed. Very tragic loss and hope he may find peace. If you need help looking after his animals - I’m in the area.

Thanks! That’s very kind, however my whole department is over looking the animals for now:)

Glad to hear!

Letter from UVA’s Brie Gertler about tomorrow’s walkout Text of the letter: “Dear members of the faculty and other instructors, It has come to my attention that there has been a call by several organizations for a walkout on central Grounds at 11:30 tomorrow (Wednesday, March 26th), with some students beginning on North Grounds at 11:10. I understand that you are scheduled to teach at that time, and I am writing to make sure that you are aware of this and to provide some guidance about how to respond if one or more of your students chooses to participate in the walkout. Promoting free expression and free inquiry on Grounds is core to our mission and integral to who we are, and it is not a violation of University policy for a student to walk out of a class, so long as they do so peacefully and without disrupting the class. At the same time, walking out of (or being absent from) class may have academic consequences for students, depending on the existing class attendance policies established by the instructor or school. Instructors are obligated to protect the free speech rights of students in academic situations such as classes, where instructors have a designated institutional role and corresponding authority and responsibilities. Please keep in mind that instructors bear this obligation to every student, regardless of the student's opinions about the walkout or the issues related to it. Our commitment to protect expressive activity lives alongside our commitment to our educational mission, and all Wednesday classes should be held as scheduled. Information about protests, demonstrations, and gatherings on University property is available at freespeech.virginia.edu. If you receive questions from your students about University policies, I encourage you to direct them to this resource. Best, Brie Gertler Interim Executive Vice President and Provost”

What's the walkout for? Sorry if I'm being dense. I'm a professor at the medical school and I've not heard anything about a planned protest.

As someone who’s walking out: That’s a really reasonable response. I appreciate the university for stating that.

Good for everyone participating. What you put up with is what you stand for.

now i kind of regret picking a stupid ivy league over UVA… this school seems like it actually cares about its students

Are the students walking out or the faculty?

That's a whole lot of words with nothing being actually said...

Imagine paying an inflated tuition to stage a walk-out nobody cares about.

what a clownshow

In support of someone who promotes terrorism? If UVA supports this “protest” take away their funding too!

Im not even a Trump orangeman supporter. UVa mustve lowered the bar alot. Too many idiot students pretending like they're more important than they are.

It's a solidarity protest against Columbia University allowing ICE to kidnap a student leader and American resident who is now being held without charges in a detention camp in Louisiana.

In support of Mahmoud Khalil from Columbia University https://www.reddit.com/r/UVA/s/1yJicspA49

It's a rally for Hamas repackaged by YDSA and SJP as something most of us support.

Nothing to be sorry about. You’re consumed with much more important priorities.

No school cares about students they care about your tuition money coming in and when you graduate to start donating…also Columbia doesn’t have to listen to trump and the government doesn’t have to give them money but that’s all it comes down the money

Well, they probably aren’t paying a tuition just to stage a walkout for one, and two why would no one care? You don’t seem to, but that doesn’t mean it isn’t important to others.

The letter literally says, basically, “students can walk out, if they do so without disrupting class, and they may or may not face any academic consequence depending on established class rules and professorial discretion.” That’s entirely anodyne and normal. What’s the clown show?

Well there’s a circus in the White House right now. Clown shows should be applauded, Right?

Go back to watching your little Japanese manga shows then. Stay inside forever. Nothing will be able to hurt you there

It really is. Absolute echo chamber from administration down.

I actually just referred this to my state legislator and respectfully requested that he review any state funding to UVA if they support terrorism, which by supporting this cause indirectly supports Hamas a terrorist organization

Except many of these students (anyone who isn’t a white male) wouldn’t be able to attend college classes if things like walk-outs didn’t happen. It’s because of protests like this that things change.

Hate to break it to ya but this is how speaking out starts. Look at any other movement in history, students are the backbone. Tbh students are probably the most free thinkers we’ve got. On top of that, students walk out of class regularly because they don’t want to be there, what’s wrong with them doing it for a cause?

Yep. Familiar with the situation. Thanks for the info.

Kidnap? LOL. That a weird way of saying deporting a POS.

Are they an illegal?

Ah. Gotcha.

I'm not going to weigh in on the politics of the demonstration, but we didn't receive the email that OP posted, so I wasn't aware of what was happening. Guess they thought we're far enough away that it wouldn't impact us (which it likely wont).

Sure, totally not about the unlawful detainment of a student whose only crime was criticising Bibi. Reichwingers are pathetic

They think their job at college is activism. Some people care, but it's not a majority, and it's probably less than the total amount of Kamala voters. I hope they at least have a good time.

Dang son, no need to demean Japanese stories bruh. The irony. No need to put down another culture for your cause.

Wow you’re a terrible person.

Why don't you go on back to your backup school and let the adults talk.

No they had a green card and were married to an American.

That’s a very generalized statement. I know I certainly didn’t think I was an activist as soon as I set foot on campus. I would think about how many students are probably in the same shoes as Mahmoud Khalil. This could happen to any one of them if it happened to him. It affects more than you think.

I suspect that most of the organizers of this action contributed to Trump's win by withholding support for Kamala due to her refusal to condemn Biden's defense of Israel.

We get it. YOu would have stood on the wrong side of every historical event in the last 100 years.

Why? Because I don’t want my tax dollars supporting terrorism?

Haha! That’s cute. Coming from somebody who eats hot pockets in grandmas basement. Deport them all baby! Get used to it.

Damn, trump should be focusing on deporting the 11 million illegals, not petty shit like this. Goes to show how much of this administration is for show, I want a real right wing president, not a democrat from 20 years ago.

Fair point.

Oh, Ok. Thanks, stranger.

the irony in this statement is astounding. your tax dollars are currently funding the genocide of palestinian people, which is a form of terrorism by the way. hope that helps!

You say "them all". Do you mean all immigrants? Do you also mean descendants of immigrants?

Be careful, don't want to cut yourself on all that edge, kid.

He wasn’t here illegally but was promoting a terrorist organization as deemed by the United States. Therefore his green card status was revoked. He didn’t have the rights of a citizen so he is being held until he can be returned to his home country.

I have friends that are Israel citizens. They legally immigrated to the US. I asked him one day what he liked best about being in the US. His answer was? “Seeing his kids get on the bus to school and not worrying that it was going to explode”. The people that have instilled that fear in a human being are the people you support. They are the definition of terrorists.

No dummy. I mean all enemies of the state like the Palestinian simp who got deported on a “student” visa and all illegal border crossers like the thugs who killed Laken Riley and the little girl Jocelyn Nungaray.

Ordered the ‘chicken biscuit’ at west range today…

chick fil-a is about to lose a ton of business

It's $5.39, too.

I ordered a falafel sandwich at the castle yesterday and they forgot the fucking falafel. $15 plus wasted. I’m pissed. Dining is so damn worried about installing a goddamn Ben and Jerry’s that they don’t bother to fix existing issues.

Now I’m not a chef, but that looks like a chicken tender with two slices of bread.

In a town with a "Chicken Strip" of chicken fast food places and fantastic gas station chicken, this is an insult to poultry.

At least it’s not an onion

Where's the biscuit?

The key at west range is to figure out which few items actually give a lot of food and are worth it

Bread with chicken.

Better than being surrounded by tablet wielding weirdos asking you which of 3 sandwiches you prefer and then blessing you like you were just baptized

Seems reasonable

You think that’s the reason they suck? Cute

The old Castle was much better. You could get a burger, fries, chicken tenders, and a shake all at 1:00 AM.

Tundy do be kinda thicc tho 👀

lord forgive me for what i’m boutta do

That thigh gap

Tundy with the thundy thighs 😩😩😩

so this is why people want to live on the lawn 😳

Straight to hell

Tundy gonna make me act different 👀

Aight I’m transferring to tech now

God is dead, and you are at fault.

Yes officer, this post right here.

And with that I’m no longer applying to UVA lol.

You are not u/sexdeprivedhoo.

Op this is cursed

Cringe redditor bruh why

no one here has posted this yet so

my friends and i bought chalk a week ago to do this but we never got around to it. now if we do it it’ll just be a copy cat crime 😔

Chalk or spray paint?

The reason?

Yeah, I can't believe the IMPs were so disrespectful like that, painting their logo on everything

Don’t chalk the bricks, stick to concrete and the like. It damages the bricks over time.

it’s ok there’s already 2 down mccormick rd, just make all the imp signs “simps”

S.I.M.P Squirrels in my pants

I’m not sure if you are joking or not, but the societies obviously have an agreement with the university and maintenance isn’t cleaning up after them. So it’s a little different, whether we actually want to see it or not haha

Ahhhh you know what, I totally forgot that. Been a while haha

Hang in there guys

did bad on a test that i was able to use notes for, currently in pain😔

hey look that's me

Just a little bit humiliating that my post ended up on here. Kinda sucks, actually. Should’ve deleted it.

And what is the administration doing for us? Teaching classes as though we were in a classroom. The professors need direction on how to teach in a pandemic. None of mine show a bit of concern ..group projects being assigned... no screen papers due! Give me a flipping break

me being lonely af w no roommate :(

For anyone struggling, UVA’s Instagram has a story up offering newly expanded mental health services. Or reach out we’re all in it together

Covid hysteria is tough on people. And we're only seeing the beginning of it. The "unknown long term effects" will be even worse.

Don’t feel bad. Professors like to use the most obscure parts of your notes or make you apply the skills you learned in ways that they didn’t teach you on open note tests sometimes. Hang in there!

Dude, mine too. Nothing to be humiliated about this is just truly a shitty year lol.

there's no shame in what you said! it's relatable honestly

yo that’s way better than having a nightmare psychopath roommate like me...

Wahoowa! GO HOOS GO! Students and fans, keep showing up and staying the full game! It makes the energy more fun and is a morale boost for the team to see their student body and community showing up to support them. From Sabre the horse, to the cavalier marching band, to the lights and music, to the game and fans itself… the energy and atmosphere at Scott Stadium was alive and well! How lucky are we to have this in our backyard here in Charlottesville?! It might not be the same crowd size as years past, but unless you’re there at the game, you can’t argue that it’s not worth going to anymore. I do think the food options could be better, but overall I was impressed after not going to a game in ages. Sports have a way of bringing people together and escaping the world for a bit. For a few hours it’s just you and thousands of people coming together to cheer on the home team. I saw more smiles and laughter last night than I had in a long time. Don’t sleep on the other UVA sports teams either, many are having a very strong year!

I was there , the defense in the fourth quarter was feeding off the crowd - which is a rarity in previous years -we have really flipped a switch

Thanks for sharing these photos!

If you told me that the team that would bring me the most joy of my 3 football teams was the Cavaliers, I would have called you nuts. They’re just a fun team to watch and you can tell people are really excited.

So happy we won but this game gave me a heart attack!

I haven't seen the stadium that full since 2019 or 2007.

Enjoy it. Support them. Grow this. Nice to have hope and the results. Great team and hope they just get better. We needed this!!!

The crowd really mattered on Saturday! Those false starts in the final defensive stand were 100% because the crowd was loud enough to prevent Wazzu from hearing their count.

Would probably not be too hard to figure out based on my profile but let’s just say another ACC team and an NFL team with an injured QB.

Get yo vaccine y’all

This is what I saw posted on Facebook this morning. Someone else posted that they had 3000 vaccines. A lot of people I know got in the car to head down there. [https://i.imgur.com/QZB02H1.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/QZB02H1.jpg)

I went today, shit was awesome. Fast, nice people, easy process. 30 minutes in and out. Supposedly VA DOH will call to set up your second dose, but worst case you can always just drive back down and ask for one. One dose is better than none guys—go get jabbed!

DANVILLE VACCINATIONS - The clinic has excess Moderna vaccines so they are giving out vaccines for walk-ins for the next 90 days. There are 3,000 available each day so try to go earlier. - The clinic runs from 8:30am to 5pm Mon-Sat. It's NOT open on Sunday! - Bring some government-issued photo identification. - Address: 325 Piedmont Drive, Danville, VA, 24540 OR 499 Mall Drive, Danville, VA, 24540 -- JCPenney entrance

Do you have to be from Virginia. I'm an OOS student so I don't know if they'll take me

Anyone offering vaccine appointments needs to turn off the ZIP code radius in search. If I don’t want to drive 2 hours for a vaccine, that’s fine but I should be given the chance to opt for one.

How early do they typically run out? Wouldn’t want to get there and miss out

Can anyone give us (2 person) a ride ?

Anyone know if it’s legit? Like is there a link to an official website or something? I don’t wanna drive for 4hrs for nothing

Tell me more.

we sure about this? "The center will be open six days per week from 8:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. for those with appointments. No walk-in visitors looking for a vaccine will be accepted." [https://www.wdbj7.com/2021/03/13/danville-covid-19-community-vaccination-center-to-open-monday/](https://www.wdbj7.com/2021/03/13/danville-covid-19-community-vaccination-center-to-open-monday/)

Everything I read said no walk in’s, appointment only

Hell yeah! Fuck the poor locals!

Rip me being out of state + not having a car + my roommates already vaccinated = not happening.

*3000 per day Edit: omg didn’t realize Dean J just responded to my meme 🤩

Did you go at the beginning of end of the day? Or does the time even matter?

Which CVS in Danville was doing it?

I was told today after getting my shot it’s open 8-5:30!

What I don’t understand is the second dose part - the post says that the “second shot will be scheduled by VDH” but how? Like what does that process look like?

I don’t think so. They’re literally just trying to give them away. Just bring any id. Even a UVA id will work

You don’t I got mine today and I am OOS

They are said to have ~3000 doses per day. This information has now gotten around, and I expect a large number of students to flood to site tomorrow. I’m trying to get there early but I have no idea if/when they will run out

I arrived at 2 and was fine. They seemed to have plenty more too

Source on the vaping? I don't doubt you but I haven't seen VA explicitly mention it yet.

When my group mentioned that we drove down from UVA, they explicitly wanted us to go back and tell as many people as possible about the center.

It’s definitely walk-in (I went today), I think they just aren’t advertising it. Someone, somewhere decided it would be better to break the rules than to let doses go to waste.

They can’t officially announce it but many students have already gone there and been told that they have extras and are just giving them away to anyone

Shouldn’t be an issue. I have an out of state ID and they didn’t seem fazed by it.

Using a throwaway to talk shit? Coward

ur an idiot

i think this is ur worst take yet

you don't need to be in-state to get it! post in fb uva rideshare if you need a driver to see if anyone has room!

I went around 10:30 or 11:00. Doesn’t seem like time of day mattered at all, they had a ton of infrastructure and relatively few people getting the shot.

Get your shot and figure it out later

I can speak for how we do it here at the vaccine clinic in town. We have a system in place that whenever we give a vaccine to someone we can either automatically schedule your second dose for the same location (either 21 or 28 days apart, depending on the vaccine) or place folks on a list for that specific day. The way we manage first/second doses insures that if you’re getting a first dose you *will* have a second dose set aside for you. This basic setup is how the entire state operates. I’m happy to answer what questions I can about the process more broadly if you would like. Or the vaccines themselves. I hope this was helpful!

When you show up for the shot they schedule the second one on site

Do you know for international students? I can bring proof of "residency" with my lease and UVa ID, but I don't have a US ID.

I doubt I’ll go until later in the week. I might PM you tomorrow to ask if you know if they plan on continuing to take walk ins 😆. Good luck!

Where does it say this? All the articles I can find say it's not walk in

> tell as many people as possible ok. wife is gonna drive down first thing in the morning. fingers crossed

Ah that makes sense. 3k per day seems like a lot (for that area)

there was another post earlier, too, for a vaccine rideshare groupme! :-) Edit: here it is: [https://www.reddit.com/r/UVA/comments/mav9lc/uva\_get\_vaccinated\_groupme\_link/](https://www.reddit.com/r/UVA/comments/mav9lc/uva_get_vaccinated_groupme_link/)

One dose is better than none

I would guess yes. I’ve heard anecdotal accounts of a uva id being sufficient

I'm international, too, and in C'ville they wanted ID that also shows your date of birth, so UVa ID wasn't sufficient. I had my national ID from my home country with me and they accepted that without issue, even though it's not a passport or the like. (They said something like an insurance card would also have worked, basically just something that has your name and DoB on it, ideally with a photo, but it sounded like they'd accept a combo of UVa ID and non-photo ID, too... (tbh, I doubt they'd have turned me away if I had said that I didn't have anything with my DoB on it....)) So yeah, bring your passport if you wanna be extra safe, but don't sweat it too much if you don't wanna carry it around :-)

for all my graduating homies

Zoom is a testament towards the college process being outdated. There are so many degrees here that you can learn barely anything and attain. Unless you’re a doctor/lawyer, it’s all about the title on the degree that we pay for.

this feels to close to home as a fourth year

It’s more like anybody with a doctorate. Those careers aren’t the only hard degrees. It’s anything that has graduate work.

Pray 4 Balz

I missed the beginning of this, what was the timeline on the shutdown?

How do they get food? Weed!

Is that a room or like a study hall type area. Are they allowed to leave their rooms? Are meals dropped of? I’m so curious about the logistics.

I think about 2 days ago, Balz-Dobie went under quarantine. They all got tested last night and we are awaiting results.

They’re not supposed to leave the building except to pick up food outside :(

Just lock it all down at this point, ND did it and it worked

I’m sure there’s a good chance of that happening in the near future, but as far as we know atm this is an isolated incident and should be treated as such. Shutting down every dorm wouldn’t work any better than shutting down the only dorm with cases if this is indeed an isolated incident. If this becomes several dorms across campus then yeah we’re getting locked down.

Real talk tho, if they lock it all up imagine the logistical nightmare food will be edit: this aged well

Spam. Do you like spam?

Asian Student Union doesn't represent all Asians I'm a 2nd-gen Chinese-American student. While the ASU claims to "unite, advocate for, and empower" our community, I would like everyone to know that the ASU doesn't speak for a lot of Asian students at UVA. It mixes concerns which are legitimate to the Asian-American community (such as combatting anti-Asian racism) with radical activism which doesn't represent all Asians at UVA. The following examples show how the ASU has frequently abused its position as an advocate for general Asian interests in favor of promoting positions which do not have a consensus among the Asian community: 1. ASU is one of the most anti-Israel clubs on campus. It is one of only 7 student organizations that signed onto Referendum 1, which calls to divest from Israel. Only 3 weeks after the horrific attack on Israeli civilians on October 7th, the ASU participated in a walkout to protest against Israel. Asian-Americans have diverse views on Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and taking the most hardline position on the conflict is not representative of our diverse collective views as a community. 2. ASU uses sweeping and controversial critiques of the American project to advocate a soft-on-CCP foreign policy. See their full statement they made on their Instagram here: "Violence towards Asians and Asian Americans in this present moment can, in no way, be separated from the long histories of U.S. militarism, imperialism, and racial capitalism. Anti-Asian violence is a core tenet of the American settler colonial project, and it is under these conditions that white supremacy thrives. Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, there have been about 3800 reported incidences of violence toward Asians and Asian Americans. Simultaneously, we have witnessed the past and current administration become increasingly hostile toward China, stoking sinophobic, inflammatory narratives about COVID-19 and escalating military expansion and action to 'counter China' through warmongering rhetoric and demonization of nations abroad. We directly attribute the murders of March 16 to the state’s anti-Asian stance that is so deeply embedded in white supremacist frameworks and ideals." As a Chinese-American whose grandpa suffered persecution for his anti-communist views, this post which was made by a CIO that claims to advocate for Asians generally definitely does not represent me. I strongly believe that the actions the current Biden administration is taking to counter the Chinese government is entirely justified. As a Chinese-American who is joining the National Guard with 2 other Asian friends who are joining the Navy ROTC, I strongly disagree with the critiques levied against US militarism. I acknowledge that there are Asians who agree with the ASU's statements, but to imply that such a statement garners consensus support among Asians at UVA is deeply inaccurate. To those in power, I would ask you to not take the ASU as an organization that is representative of general Asian interests. It is an activist group who is falsely claiming that they are advocating for our community at-large. &#x200B; &#x200B;

You’re asking a leftist student organization to promote centrist/conservative views? Not gonna happen, man. Their instagram bio calls for “collective liberation” - they aren’t gonna be promoting the US military with that mission statement 💀

This sort of thing tends to happen with college advocacy groups ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Intersectionality encourages groups with a previously narrow focus to become jacks of all trades on social issues

This likely describes most clubs at UVA…

This going to shock you but your Congressmember doesn’t represent everyone’s views either.

It’s also quite ironic that TSA (Taiwanese Student Association) quite often supports ASU 💀

My partner in Christ, ain’t no way you’re seething abt an organization taking a stand against the murder of children and genocide. It maybe u who doesn’t get the goal of ASU

hey I'm not a UVA student but I actually feel like an Asian advocacy group taking a position on a conflict in Asia is actually pretty normal

Wow I had no idea ASU was anti Israel that’s based af thanks for letting me know 👍

If anyone understands how it is to be colonized it’s people from Asia. The surprise at their anti apartheid stance reflects on your disconnection with your roots more than anything.

If you are worried this group doesn’t represent you then maybe you should actively join it. If you are indeed in the majority, which you for some reason believe based on anecdotal evidence (you and YOUR 2 friends lol), then the policies and viewpoints of the group will shift to match. If the group doesn’t represent you, then you are failing to make your voice heard by them. Whining about it on reddit is silly, unless you just want to be consoled by an echo chamber. Thinking that a group which represents a huge group of people completely is silly anyway. Of course most people within that group will have a wide range of views. If you want to change what the consensus of that group is, join and run for a position of power.

bruh womp womp FREE PALESTINE TIL ITS BACKWARDS

non uva student here, this post was recommended to me. stopped reading after u mentioned israel. as a chinese who's grandma suffered during the cultural revolution and who's dad immigrated to the US after being mistreated by the chinese govt, i had to laugh. cope.

As a Chinese international student, I believe there is no problem with supporting Palestine or free Palestine, and actually it should. I don't agree with everything Israel did, like carpet bombing and illegal settlements. But we have to be very clear that we are not teaming at with Hamas. Also I believe the US shouldn't be soft with CCP or Russia, which this ASU organization clearly advocate for. So it is really important for UVA to check whether this organization received funding from CCP, just like Codepink organization, which shouted by Nancy Pelosi to go back China. Any organization that undermines the democratic principles of America shouldn't be tolerated at campus

It's annoying how much pan-asian activism related things get hijacked by other other movements

Free Palestine 🍉

I don’t go here but they sound based

To represent a culture anywhere, let alone a college campus, is deeply political in nature. Surely there are other areas in UVA that represent views that align more with yours, but to have a cultural organization that fails to make a position on a situation or conflict that puts other minorities or marginalized people at risk is to ignore the shared struggles that people of color have faced through the years, that including all of the atrocities pertaining to Asia in the 20th century. I believe that it is important for them to make statements like that; activism and advocacy are not mutually exclusive things either. It just doesn't sound like that is the right space for you. You seem to be more closely connected to the US military, so it would make sense that you aren't too happy to hear that ASU is protesting against the genocidal acts of a US ally, but I am surprised that you are resistant to the claims to Sinophobia regarding the American stance towards China. It isn't necessarily that Joe Biden and the military's posturing towards China is sinophobic in itself, but the rhetoric that they have allowed to spread does, to some degree, carry anti-Chinese sentiment. Surely you can at least see that if you brought up the point of antisemitism in the comments. Again, it also seems that ASU posted about the Israel-Palestine conflict after the outbreak of war and the pretty evident destruction and murder of the Palestinian people at the hands of the IDF, in the name of wiping out Hamas. But taking a step back and looking at the big picture, I think as Asians in America we can appreciate other non-Asian Americans supporting Stop Asian Hate and standing in solidarity with Asian people. Don't you think it is at least justified for them to say something in support of the Palestinian people in this time?

Rest in Power, Aaron Bushnell, a man who chose to sacrifice himself and no longer be complicit in genocide after being an active duty U.S. Air Force member. Maybe learn from your senior, he (25) was 8 years older than you.

I definitely wish that cultural orgs in general could either (ideally) be less political or at least disclose. I’m a PoC who’s also religious and conservative, and a fair number of my political beliefs spring from my cultural identity. It’s always super awkward when you go to the club for your cultural identity and someone is bashing on a big part of that identity. I have several other PoC friends who actively avoided the multicultural student center at UVA because the dean in charge made us feel super unwelcome due to our political stance and because”liberal” folks felt comfortable in their use of racial slurs against those who had a different political viewpoint.

As a white male former baseball player who was recruited by the Asian Student Association to dominate coed inter-mural dodgeball at my college, I can report that the organization was inclusive and had great dumplings.

I remember when I joined CSA (Chinese Student Association) and it was all Taiwanese/HongKongers who hated Chinese.. then that organization imploded because the Taiwanese and Hong Kongers couldn't get a long so we ended up getting a TSA (Taiwanese Student Association) and a CSA (Cantonese Student Association) and the new Chinese students had to make their own CSSA... it's so stupid

That's just all about student clubs, especially the ethnic ones. They are mostly run by American born, who don't know a shit about anything about the country they represent. So, don't expect much from them.

ASU is off the rails They defended affirmative action even though Harvard as known to have used it to discriminate against Asians by rating them lower in personality scores Also, most Asians I know are generally supportive of the US. Yes, even the ones I’ve met who live in Asia. Yes, even the ones I’ve met in Vietnam. I really don’t think their support of China is anything beyond “Asian = good and any criticism is racism.” It’s a silly and reductive argument, especially when China is guilty of many of the criticisms that they say the US has. I don’t mind that the group supports Palestine, but getting behind SJP in particular? Having it be the primary focus of the group over Asian stuff? It’s about political signaling

As a Tibetan American whose family suffered from the CCP policies, I concur.

When joining a college club typically I expect to enjoy activities like language, culture, food, networking, and not so much to do activism of any kind

White dude here but with a lot of these groups they're gonna be dominated by left leaning individuals just due to how people perceive race in relation to politics. Due to then having a lot of leftist who also conflate being Anti-American with being pro-other Anti-American countries which results in support of countries who are legitimately much worse, but they're seen as opponents of America making them seem good to support. This makes a really dangerous dichotomy that ends up with leftist enabling/supporting/defending/excusing/etc things they accuse America of, or worse. These countries also push propaganda on this(Russia/USSR is well documented as pushing Anti-Imperialist propaganda on these groups, or China has historically used being a victim of colonizing as an excuse despite being a colonizer too) to bolster these claims. While I'm left and my friends are, we understand that America has made many mistakes, as have many countries, but that doesn't mean other countries who oppose America are benevolent nations with good intentions.

Well said bro, I'm a Chinese student, and I recommend UVA investigate whether this organization have received funding from the CCP government

They sound based as fuck lmao

ASU should really stop supporting Hamas and carrying water for the CCP, it's beneath them.

be so fkn fr my dude. radical activism?

It frustrates me so much when nonpartisan just regular organizations that collectivize a part of the student population has an exec board that uses their platform to advocate the “common good” ie leftist talking points. I call it the “common good” because any address of the activism is responded to with something along the lines of bigot or boot licker. The people who hold the views should just participate in SJP or DSA in their free time. Makes no sense to me

Thank you for this excellent posting. As an alumnus I can say I wish more UVA students had the perspicacity and moral courage to speak out as you just did. Also, as a member of a multi-generational military family with ancestors, siblings, and nephews who have served on active duty, thank you for YOUR service to our great country. The ASU could not be more wrong in its depiction of America as a racist, colonial power. Can they spell “CCP?”

Isn’t the CCP friendly towards Israel?

wah wah nerd maybe if you cosplay as a soldier hard enough your masters will let you kill a palestinian child yourself

This is literally so dumb like can you just go to class and be quiet does everything have to be about race

What are yall even TALKING about lmao

Well I will just say while I have the utmost respect for you and your families lived experience. As a historian simply being anti communist does not make someone inherently good. Taiwan where all the Uber capitalists went killed thousands of people they labeled as CCP sympathizers or spies soooo Just don’t be involved with ASU if it doesn’t reflect your views end of the day …

no amount of self-flagellating over China will make you white. fact of the matter is, your average american just sees an Asian person and assumes Chinese. so hating on China is actually doing a disservice to all of us...

Reminds me of Mecha at Arizona State: https://www.statepress.com/article/2024/02/politics-mecha-de-asu-suspended-65dd5a73a736f#

I don’t want the ASU to promote any views. As an example, the Virginia Tech ASU doesn’t comment on things which don’t relate to the Asian community. Whenever they comment on social issues, it is because it relates to the Asian American community, such as with stop Asian hate. They are using their representation of all Asians to do something which doesn’t represent all Asians (promoting a certain broad political viewpoint). If someone is Asian and leftist, that’s fine and I would think the ASU represents them. But many people are Asian and not leftist. ASU should represent all Asians or change their name.

You’ve mastered the obvious. Move on to your next level

THE OMNICAUSE

VSU does too. Ironically, having been to Vietnam, Vietnamese people generally support the US because of Chinese expansion into waters, and like American things. Whoops, sorry about the whole China good west bad thing they had going

Unless TSA has changed in the last year (my daughter and her friends were officers there), they do not support any radical activism.

The only group who is attempting to commit genocide and murder children is Hamas who wants to genocide all the Jews in Israel.

Very poorly stated. Your grammar is horrendous. Your core premise fallacious. I’m typing this slowly. Did you just comprehend what I’m saying?

see my response to other non-UVA students. There is a lot of subcontext that is difficult for non-UVA students to understand. As an example, the fact that our relationship with the state of Virginia is very important since around 10% of our funding is dependent on them. The attorney general has denounced UVA student groups that advocated extreme positions in the past which affects our Board of Visitors and school funding. Lots of students want CIOs to pursue a policy of non involvement because of this, and because of the fact that uninvolved CIO members can get blacklisted for promoting radical views.

Kihei Clark Appreciation Post Thank you Kihei for all your incredible contributions throughout your time at UVA! One play does not define your legacy, and it's sad to see the amount of hate that is being spewed. Your talent on the court has brought us so much joy on numerous occasions over the years, and know that you will always have a whole community of Hoos cheering you on <3 <3

Real ones remember when he came in clutch for the Natty in 2019. How quickly the ungrateful forget. We all make mistakes, forever grateful for the work Kihei put in these five years. You’ll always be a fixture of my basketball time at UVA!

One play does define his legacy....and that is the pass that tied the game which led to a National Championship.

What makes me sad is that people are attacking his character and him as a person over one play

I will love this man for life. The catalyst for the greatest sporting moment I'll ever experience. Frankly we as Hoos probably achieved an emotional high many other sports fans will never achieve. Umbc -> 🏆

A true star on and off the court.

I am sad for him. Look forward to next year but am really sad.

Just watch his reels. I became a fan. A skilled, total team player and his record cannot be denied.

He got a call from Vegas before the game. Check his call logs.

Booooooooo. He’s been a mediocre PG at best. The fact that two passes were the defining moments of his career should tell you something. 😳😳.

Choking happens. People mess up under pressure. We had a great season, and you're going to remember it for two shitty games at the end? Imagine being so low that you feel the need to attack a guy who messes up at his job less than most white-collar professionals.

Imagine being so angry and bitter towards another human being over a basketball game. I hope you find some happiness that you seem to be lacking.

Just exactly how many career defining moments do you want him to have???

This sucks… really?

He’s been here for 5 damn years. You’d think he’d have more defining moments…

Career defining is by definition the few best highlights. He's had plenty of great moments. He hit the buzzer beater to beat VT in 2020. He assisted on the Woldentensae game winner against UNC the same year. He assisted on Reece Beekman's game winner against Duke. He hit a three to spark a run against Oregon in our natty champ run. Hit several other big shots that tournament too. I can keep going, but if you think Kihei Clark only made one great play in his career at UVA, you haven't been paying attention.

Yet they Yell 'Our State'.

Look, always remember this: every UVA student and every VT student has one thing in common: they all got into VT.

Both UVA and VT football will have to get a lot better if joining the SEC or Big 10 is ever going to occur. That game looked like high school football.

God please take this embarrassing cope post down we’re better than this

Honestly don't care that VT won. It's nothing new. What did kind of bother me is that after an unsurprising and pretty easy victory, they still felt the need to rush our field, especially knowing what a hard year our team has had since last December. Idk just kind of felt like rubbing unnecessary salt in a gaping wound. Maybe that's just me, it just didn't sit right. 🤷

Let’s be honest, football is the most prestigious and monetarily valuable college sport.

Ah yes. Except football. The sport people care the most about.

Well, ive met at least a dozen other people who transferred from Tech to UVA like me. I don’t know if the opposite ever happens

Well, they have to get their win in somewhere. Might seem cruel if we took football too.

Sounds like someone’s a little sore about losing…. Boo hoo hoo 🦃🦃🦃

If OP can honestly say they have watched a single event in any of the sports UVA dominated VT in recently fair play. When it comes to revenue sports VT has done very well recently

This must be the saddest cope post I’ve ever seen

Butthurt Nation stand up🤣

Lmfao, cope harder Cavaliers

Stay mad lol. 55-17

Who cares about any sport besides football

cope post. you don’t pay attention to 90% of those other sports so don’t pretend like you care about them because you lost at arguably the most important one

Of the 14 varsity sports the two schools compete in against each other, VT won 7 of the most recent games. In 4 sports, VT has more wins in the rivalry record. In 2 sports(baseball and basketball), the rivalry record isn’t “dominated” by UVA even remotely. You haven’t won more than even 50% of the meetings. Your meme is as bad as your football team.

Hey fuck wads you got beat. Grow up

This is pretty close to the Bedlam situation in Oklahoma…

Yet UVA fans are still miserable…..have bigger aspirations than beating VT in football and maybe then UVA football will be better. Tech has been mediocre to poor in football since 2012 yet UVA acts like it is the Super Bowl. Get rid of the countdown clocks, stop the rock breaking, strive to recruit better, and set the goal for playing in conference championship.

Why did I get recommended this sub? Go Birds lmao

Why do we even care about football? We will never be relevant in football, but we are in every other sport.

Nah I didn't apply to VT 😂

As an out of state student, I didn’t even think about VT

Stealing this for gt/uga debates

Not true if they applied to engineering...

Tech scored 55 points and we scored 17, and we’re talking about both schools needing to get better? We got a lot of work to do ourselves

Funny enough UVA lost to both the SEC and B1G this year. And it wasn’t close either.

It looked like high school football because you got your ass beaten all 60 minutes

I mean, they let *us* in. Besides, we need a new school that's great at basketball but bad at football, because Indiana is starting to be not so great at basketball either. Virginia would fit right in.

no joke. Bad grammar, like where do you go to college? Norfolk State?

Vt always rushes the field when we win. It doesn’t help that your field is literally connected to the student section with no barriers…

I think it was mostly fueled by Anthony Chlamydia making those dumbass comments and your barstool rep tweeting things anti VT propaganda all week. It’s a rivalry, get over yourself

This is ridiculous…we have to move on eventually

And that is why basketball is more important at UVA right now, lol

Basketball and football are both revenue generating sports

Think about it this way: Would you rather be mediocre (but better than a heated rival) in one sport, even the most popular sport, but suck ass at everything else? Or be terrible at the most popular sport but kick ass at everything else? You gotta keep in mind, Tech may be *better* at football, but they’re still not good. They’re barely bowl eligible, and this is the best season they’ve had in a few years.

Anyone in engineering does lol. The opposite happens for law and medical. I’ve seen both.

It does. I know quite a few who did :)

Could you message me please? (It won’t let me message you) I want to transfer to UVA from tech and had a few questions. Thanks!

As if there was a choice. 😂

In 2 sports baseball and basketball, UVA has a natty. :) &#x200B; Your football team and program is as bad as ours, we just suck against you .

You in our sub tho, so…. rent free

Nope. UVA played Tech in 2 sports today and each school won one of them.

How to get a gf here? I am not lumpy, I have friends. What I don’t have is a gf. I don’t have the time to join a heavily time committed club, and I seem to have little luck on dating apps. What should I do? Talk to girls in class? I don’t know.

sit in main library with a sign stating your love quest to find a boyfriend free girl

never worry about getting a girlfriend, desperation can lead to being with the wrong person. If you focus on yourself and are social you will naturally meet the right person.

just mew every once and awhile

the fact that people have to preface their lonely posts with "I am not lumpy" lol

Brother, take some advice from a relatively recent college grad (KU, not UVA, but still). Don't focus on the women. Build your own hobbies. Focus on enjoying life. Love comes and goes when love comes and goes. But knowing how to smoke a good brisket or fix your own car or being able to go help people with home repairs/renovations helps a lot.......just so ya know.

Don't treat women like a conquest, or an endgame. Set a goal for you to meet a nice girl (which comes from meeting new people in general). Just be yourself and keep doing things you like, and eventually, that thing you like will bring you into contact with someone that likes doing the same thing. Bingo, you did it. And, if it's not already obvious, get off the computer and go outside. Sitting on a gamer chair playing WoW all day most certainly won't help.

Risky move: try to turn a friend into a gf

IMO UVA had a weird dating culture when I was there. My opinion was shared by a few of my friends, as well. That said, I dated someone in college and it was the same way most decent relationships happen - make friends, become close, and wait for something to blossom. A watchpot never boils, especially in relationships.

Hey! What's wrong with being lumpy?

Get a job at Outback Steakhouse in Cville. Works every time.

don't use reddit for advice like this look at the profiles of people like me💀

Are you mewing??? Are you edging??? Are you properly gooning ??? She should manifest

Here’s the secret…..don’t look for one! Seriously. Just don’t. Focus on building your life and add value. The beauty of adding value to yourself…others see it and will want to be a part of it. Men and women. It’s hard…I know..in your 20’s and seeing others succeed with the opposite sec but I’ll guarantee that in 10 years…a majority of the couples you see now won’t be together then and dating takes a lot of Money, Energy, Attention, and Time. That’s valuable resources you can use to build YOUR value. At 39 I can easily see and do what I’m telling you to do but TRUST me…you can succeed in life by focusing on building YOUR value. So….BUILD YOUR VALUE.

Don’t worry about it for at least 5+ years and enjoy this time without it!!! Trust me!!!

>I don't have time to join a heavy time committed club What makes you think you have time for a romantic relationship in that case?

Talking to people in class is cringe, trying to talk to girls at the bar is cringe, trying to talk to girls at parties is cringe, talking in any public setting is cringe, and using dating apps is cringe. Hope that helps, good luck!

What's your year and major? I'm just curious.

You just have to go out, go to the parties, hit the bars, be social and eventually you’ll catch a girl giving you the eyes, and then boom.

Get a flyer

Yes, talk to them between classes. Nothing heavy. Ask questions like how they feel about class topics or assignments. It's a basic icebreaker, then introduce yourself. Smile and compliment them on something. And sort of leave it at that. Smile and wave and be confident. Usually, those small interactions will lead to something else. An opportunity to get to know them. Ask them what people do for fun or hang out at around here. Tell them you're from UVA and still feeling things out and see where it takes you. Keep it simple, be truthful, and confident and just let it flow. Smile and nod or wave. Not weirdly, but small smirk or whatever. Most people will smile back. You want to be warm and inviting. Then let the rest flow. I've found that when you are smart, you can help them figure things out or be handy, and that's where you can really make a connection. When it feels right, offer your number to go for a run, grab some lunch, or a study session to or to talk some more. Tell them about the best study spots you've found or flex your coffee knowledge and offer to buy a cup. A few of these things here and there should put you on the right path. Just be genuine.

Basically the real answer is get super focused on yourself and your goals You get your life on track and the women themselves will take over They won't tolerate seeing a successful young man remain single It's against their religion

Class would be your best bet if you’re really set on getting into a relationship, but honestly I think you may be better off waiting, and focusing on your studies. If you don’t have time for clubs you probably don’t have time to maintain a healthy relationship. I was already with my gf for 5 years before I started at UVA, we lived off campus and even that was a strain time wise and we felt it. That said, you know your schedule better than I do. Good luck out there champ!

If you go looking then youll find the wrong one, wait for the right one to find u

Just keep truckin’ along. Honk honk

I would branch out using your friends, ask them if they know people who is in the realm of who you are interested in. Also get to know the people in your peripheral to a pretty comfortable point and ask that you are interested in dating and if they know anyone your type. If people can network for a job it should be easy to network for someone you want to date. Also if you don’t want to go to the hastle of making and building up relationships then what’s the point of pursuing a relationship aside from selfish notions of pleasure.

Work out, eat healthy, focus on developing skills/interests/projects and introduce yourself to one new person/day (male or female). Self confidence starts from within, your actions will mirror that.

Go to the gym dawg

Most men are having trouble finding a relationship. It ain’t just you

Go check out the center median at Hydraulic and 250. There’s a girl there just about every day who I’m sure would love to be your GF if you asked. Not the fat guy who is there sometimes (unless that’s what you looking for)

Go to church, volunteer, be involved at school- you will be better for it and ultimately you will find a girl with similar values and interests. Relationships are not easy so find someone they can be easier with

Just live your life & it’ll happen.. making posts like this & acting desperate ..women pick up on it & it gives creepy “nice guy” vibes & it only makes you less attractive.. women are more attracted to someone who goes with the flow & does their own thing not being all needy & down cos they don’t have a girl yet

Kids really don’t talk to each other in real life anymore, huh?

You become the type of man that girls are attracted to. Be honest, polite, respectful, and interesting.

So if you don't have time to go out and meet people, what time do you have for a gf? Like, what will you give up to spend time with a woman that you won't give up to meet them in the first place?

Get close with a girl who already has a BF, learn what she loves and hates throughout the relationship while telling her very little about u. Let her feel safe around you, and when she has an issue with her boyfriend, that’s when u swoop in and comfort her with some dick down. These UVA girls are not stupid lol, they are academically smart and smarter in dating. Don’t let a bitch play u lol. And be careful of these white savior girlies, their whole family is from goochland and got ties to the KKK and still supports BLM 😭😭😭😭🤝🤝🤝. Have fun at uva, I’m a 22 grad and played d1 there.

Go find you a townie

I think it's hard to really give accurate advice on this, without knowing a lot more.... I hope you find what you are looking for. The following story is sarcastic advice. Hopefully it will show things could be worse even with a girlfriend. It IS however the way a sophomore "courted" me as a freshman. The relationship lasted almost two years until I got more therapy. Find a girl in your dorm ideally.... One who seems a tiny bit sad, befriend her. Spend two or three months being her best friend. Go to dinner every night. See what she's doing on the weekends. If she is in her room, invite her over to watch something you think she will enjoy. Then tell her you've fallen in love and can not be her friend anymore it hurts tooo much.... Your slightly depressive female friend will not have the coping skills to adjust and then decide to date you. When she decides to look at you romantically take it even further. Say you need her to be your girlfriend and she can't see anyone else. Again, she has built no other coping mechanisms for such a drastic change and she will agree. BOOM girlfriend!!! I do not suggest this method as both parties were foolish for getting involved. However, it is the story of my first college boyfriend.

Transfer to JMU

Damn there’s really a sub for everything. Idek why this hit my TL. Been outta school for years now lol

Could you try being more attractive?

What do you do outside of school that doesn’t allow you to join activities?

Work on becoming the best version of yourself. Then go hangout in social spots with women and then talk to the ones you find attractive. Make them laugh. Be someone other people want to be around. Yes you actively do this, it's a skill you develop. Have fun!

Having a gf takes time, so it wouldn’t hurt to budget in that time now. Try: 1 hr/wk at a club that interests you + 1hr/wk getting coffee with someone After a few weeks, ask a girl from your club to coffee to get to know her, no strings attached. If you like her, ask her next week. If you don’t, ask someone else. Girls are much more likely to say yes to coffee than to a date. The key is to genuinely want to know them as people, not as prospective gfs. Give them time to decide whether they want you before letting on that you might be interested. Like others have said, girls can smell desperation a mile away. They want someone who wants THEM, not a girlfriend in the abstract. Source: worked for me

Focus on school and having fun, u add a girlfriend in there you will end up sacrificing one of the other two. Ur at UVA get ur grades and enjoy urself. Women will come.

Long Live President Ryan

The Jefferson Council (group behind much of this) has a web form up to "hold the University of Virginia’s Board of Visitors and administrators accountable to preserving Thomas Jefferson’s legacy of freedom and excellence". Perhaps they need some reminding about what those words really mean.... [https://jeffersoncouncil.org/take-action](https://jeffersoncouncil.org/take-action)

Why did he obey in advance? I'm livid.

My neighbors Son got accepted … this neighbor is not exactly a right wing nut, I would call him a Limousine Liberal type. He himself said he was disgusted by the amount of DEI and LBGTQ material his Son received along with the usual acceptance docs. It was almost like they were saying “you should consider yourself lucky that you, a white heterosexual male was let in”.

Fuck him. He helicoptered out of here and left us to live/work/study under whatever Trump/Miller-approved facist they appoint as the next president.

The best way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race.

Is there anything that can be done to hold this group accountable for their behavior?

A bunch of goons.

The new Board of Visitors, whose term begins on July 1, was going to fire him.

Justice Department officials have told University of Virginia officials that hundreds of millions of dollars in federal funding are at risk because of what the department says is the school’s disregard for civil rights law over its diversity practices, according to two of the people. In the hopes of ensuring that the funding is not stripped from the school, members of the school’s oversight board who were appointed by Gov. Glenn Youngkin, a Republican, have been in discussions with Justice Department to learn what could be done, according to a person briefed on the matter. As part of those discussions, the Justice Department has said that Mr. Ryan must go, according to three of the people. https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/26/us/politics/university-of-virginia-president-trump.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare

I can’t answer with certainty, but the Trump Admin put him in a position where he’d look bad if he stayed and fought. UVA already lost substantial funding from federal cuts. If President Ryan stayed and used UVA funding to fight it, or if he would have stayed and UVA lost more funding, he would have looked like he was acting to the detriment of UVA and its students. The Trump Admin put him into a lose-lose situation.

Going through something like this would be extremely stressful and possibly expensive. I do not know Mr. Ryan, but I am thinking he may have thought this whole debacle would have unnecessarily hurt the students, faculty and others at UVA and would have been counterproductive to the real mission. Plus, it would have been tough on his family as well. Maybe if and when Abigail Spanberger gets elected, Mr. Ryan can be put on the BOV or in some other very important position for Virginia : ) !

Maybe he's tired and doesn't have it in him to fight? Maybe he signed up to be a university president, not the leader of some political resistance. Maybe he's tired of being a punching bag from some political extreme no matter what reasonable stance he takes as president of a public university. The first thing he did as president was expand financial aid to poor Virginians. The guy was a normal dude and deserves to gtfo

I’m sure you know better than him.

Typical attorney. Wrote a letter like a little biotch to try to get sympathy etc...all people will remember is that in a time of need he bailed. If you are going to be a putz and resign, just do it. There's no need to act like it's some self-sacrifice gesture. Better yet, don't resign. Stay there and make them vote you out. If you stay, you can tell BOV why you are fighting DOJ. You can take it to the people of the state as well. For realz, why quit? Makes you wonder if DOJ has dirt on Ryan. If so what do you think they have?

Respectfully, I’ll say it’s more complicated than that. There’s a lot of funding that UVA stands to lose. While I’ll never be the one to say that we should care about money above caring for and respecting people, losing that money affects a lot of students and a lot of jobs and could have repercussions on UVA as a whole for years to come. I don’t blame you for being upset and apprehensive of whatever comes next, but this decision is full of nuance and should not be chalked up as an easy one for President Ryan to have made.

It’s fun spamming troll posts all day huh

Yes, so stop acting in a racist manner - something the United States has struggled with even in the wake of the 1960’s revolution in Black citizen’s autonomy. Of course, Christopher Rufo has already announced (in accord with Steven Miller) - the medium term goal is to repeal the Civil Rights Act of 1964 - so, there’s that on the horizon.

You clearly know nothing about equal protection or discrimination.

White people are overrepresented at UVA relative to the state’s population, clearly they need to stop the discrimination against nonwhite people

I wish. But: “Forget it, Jake. It’s Chinatown.”

I would have rather he forced them to fire him.

Pull another Helen Dragas? That ended well.

So let them fire him. He shouldn’t have stepped aside to make it easier for them!

Hundreds of millions of dollars are now at risk of being funneled into changing the University into a RWNJ’s wet dream. Ryan stepping aside did nothing to save the university, he hastened its demise.

Jim Ryan should go ask Columbia how complying worked out for them

Exactly - he is (unfortunately) walking away with some semblance of self-respect. This is sickening…Wishing Jim fortune, health, and happiness. Thank you for everything!

Not an easy one for sure. But the funding is still at risk. Give a mouse a cookie…

okay so he had to agonize a bit before he helicoptered out of here and left us to live/work/study under whatever Trump-approved facist they appoint as the next president.

darling, what the trump/miller admin wants is the dismantling of higher education almost entirely, leaving just enough credentialing for the mediocre sons of mediocre white people but excising all the public funding for pure and applied research (gotta privatize that). our "infighting" on this Reddit thread, my darling, is so, so, so, so, so, so far beneath their gaze that it's comical you issue this warning.

I felt the same when I first heard but further reading convinced me it would have been fruitless. Unlike Columbia and Harvard, UVA is a public institution under the thumb of a Republican governor and his appointed lackeys on the Board of Visitors. I assume they threatened him with financial penalties and bogus legal investigations than would have burdened him in retirement. He deserves better. Thank you, James Ryan, for your laudable service. I wish you a well deserved fruitful retirement. WAH-HOO-WAH, sir.

https://news.virginia.edu/content/uva-president-jim-ryans-statement-community

that happened in Nov 2024. You think Jim Ryan has a choice?

I don’t think that’s a fair comparison. Columbia was targeted as a university, whereas President Ryan was signaled out on his own by the DOJ. It would have been hard for President Ryan to justify UVA losing millions to protect him alone.

And Youngkin is a suck-up toady trying to curry favor with Trump.

Sure but it seems to me that requires us to view these events in absurdly individualistic terms. Given that the DOJ and Trump admin are coming after every institution of higher education they can, the specific pretexts they concoct for any individual power grab are only useful insofar as they provide a foothold. Ryan was targeted for the same reasons Columbia was: the Trump regime sees independent universities as a threat. By stepping aside, Ryan only serves to pave the way for them.

it's not, though. it happens because "oh noes we can't violate the norms" and "oh noes, civility" and "oh noes, we must reach across the aisle" while the cynics take what they want.

Fuck Office 365 That is all.

Ah, found the reason (From [UVA ITS](https://virginia.service-now.com/its/?id=itsweb_kb_article&sys_id=2d3b4e8edb8f17806d905638dc96192f)) "Note: In early 2021, Google announced significant changes to their educationally focused email/productivity suite. Google is adjusting its education licensing model from no-cost, unlimited storage to a quota/consumption-based revenue model that goes into effect in 2022." Still BS in my opinion.

We're really about to have to use outlook for email. Also, what's going to happen to accounts we created using sign in with Google?

Fuck Office 365, all my homies hate Office 365

I assume that we will no longer have infinite storage in Google Drive, right? If so, I might move all my research files to my undergrad Gmail account since I still have infinite storage there even after graduating several years ago. ...and start using my undergrad Gmail as my main email while working at UVA.

If you want action to be taken, sign the petition ***and*** send ITS a politely worded email or two about why they shouldn't switch to Office 365. Go to the ITS website, scroll all the way to the bottom, and click "contact ITS". EDIT: There's also the [office365project@virginia.edu](mailto:office365project@virginia.edu) email address.

What the shit

It's *terrible* for collaboration.

\[Everyone disliked that.\] &#x200B; (i dont use drive that much anyway, however i HATE outlook and have been advised by tech-savvy people to look into IMAP in order to access email from other applications/websites, so just passing on that info)

UVA staff here. Outlook 365 is not terrible, and the Outlook app for Windows is actually a fairly powerful full featured email app. I’ll take Word and Excel over Google Docs and Sheets any day, but file sharing and collaboration is WAY better in Google Drive. If anyone can explain the intersection between Teams, OneNote, SharePoint and OneDrive, please do. Also, Outlook 365 apps for the Mac are not great. I know faculty and staff can retain their Virginia.edu addresses upon retirement by sending an email every year to some address. Wonder if that’s an option for alums.

I understand the knee jerk reaction, but is this really that bad? All of the faculty and staff are already on 365 and have been for years. This should actually make collaboration better, not worse. I'm gonna give it a chance.

Let's not worship Google, who has a history of making bloated web software that sells your info to advertisers and has little understanding for privacy. Microsoft, for all their faults, makes pretty good software and services. I for one welcome our square overlords.

Embrace the outlook

oh god I hadn't thought of that

outlook is great, just takes a little getting used to but it’s much better for productivity than Gmail

What does this mean to those of us who are still using their Virginia.edu address after…ahem, a decade or so?

This is not getting nearly enough attention

wait so our email won’t be computingid@virginia.edu anymore??? i like the virginia.edu ): and my computing id

Wait so for clarity, if we *do* graduate before the switch, we can retain our .edu?

[FUCK OFFICE 365 ALL MY HOMIES HATE OFFICE 365](https://i.imgur.com/3vxQsPT.jpg) ^^^this ^^^has ^^^been ^^^an ^^^accessibility ^^^service ^^^from ^^^your ^^^friendly ^^^neighborhood ^^^bot

Take my award. Plz sign this. I have so many job applications open with google sign in.

Excel and Sheets are good, but collaboration is most of the point for Google Drive. OneDrive works, but isn't quite as good. Plus the overall web interface is a downgrade.

i've only ever heard my professors complaining about 365

Actually no, we’ve been resisting it too. It is not designed well.

The web interface is best described as "a complete dumpster fire".

Even if I can change it, I don't remember all the accounts I created with it.

Wait, where are you/other people seeing this? Because if so that's a HUGE problem. I read the whole IT page and it sounds to me like the addresses will stay the same, just run through Outlook and you lose access 2 years after graduation. Which is still arguably a problem, but a separate one.

Wait i thought alumnus get to keep their virginia edu email indefinitely? It should not bw affected by whether we use Google or Microsfot tho?

I’ve never had the pleasure of using it and I suppose this is one silver lining of graduating in ‘22. I wish y’all the best of luck

[https://myaccount.google.com/permissions](https://myaccount.google.com/permissions) will let you see what you've hooked up to your Google account. It's probably a lot safer to use a password manager and setup separate logins for these services anyway.

Are you seeing that explicitly stated somewhere? The only stuff I can find on the IT page is about losing access after graduation.

Damn 😞😞 fuck UVA all my homies hate UVA

WTF this is outrageous

Thank you i will give it a try in a few days. Do you happen to know if we can make the forwarding go on indefinitely past the 2 years mark or no?

Thank you! I appreciate it

Christian's on the Corner I know most students are packing up and heading home, but for those of us who are here year round, I wanted to share this. Three of my staff members went into Christians at lunchtime today. After a litany of outrageous comments, the guy behind the counter said "we serve men first" as he rung up a man who arrived after them and gave that man something for free. I've looked for contact info for the location online (I believe locations are independently owned), but can't find it. ETA: A contact of mine got word to Christian, who sold the location years ago, but he's apparently reaching out to the owner.

That’s called discrimination where I come from and is illegal!

I've had similar experiences with the Corner Christians! Last time I went I was sworn at for not knowing what I wanted when I walked inside (I was the only customer). Hope your staff are doing okay!

That’s soooooo gross!!! I’m so sorry. To any students reading this: now is a good time to mention that crozet pizza runs deals for us. They have a couple menu items for under $10 in case you are hungry and craving some pizza. I’ve always enjoyed going there… Can’t imagine why I would go to Christians instead.

I'm convinced that place is a front. The pizza is bad, and there's not a lot of variety, there's only ever one (pretty unhinged) guy working there, and they tune their radio just so it constantly dips in and out of static. I'm not making any guesses but it's hard to believe pizza is their only business

Hoping to God the locations are independently owned, because I absolutely love the 5th Street one. Great pizza and great price.

Well, I'm never going there again, Dean J. What a ridiculous crock. I'm sorry you had to go through that.

Hi Dean J, I’m sorry this happened to your staff and hoping they’re doing better. Was the interaction recorded? Or if you can describe it in further detail? Regardless that is a crazy statement for them to say, and I think I found the contact info for the location you talked about. I’m a guy - so I’ve never had an experience of the sort, but disappointed if this is true. Link: Https://g.co/kgs/iYtymr4 Phone #: 434-872-0436 As for action, like you said, it’s hard because most students are leaving, but for a business that is dependent on student traffic - if they keep this up, it’ll be boycotted. Not sure what action can be taken besides reviews but I’m sure if this gets around other students (I’m an alum) will test out that policy in real time and get coverage on it until they change it and apologize.

Something similar happened to me, I was with my friends(I am a woman), and they wouldn’t let any men into the building, just us. It was on St. Paddy’s day, and the man behind the counter kept asking us if we had alcohol and if we could give him some. It wasn’t very comforting at all, especially because he only let women into the building

Christian’s stinks as do the ingredients they use. Not present on the corner, but Vita Nova (in the Mall) is true Italian pizza with real ingredients. Giovanni, the owner, still works in the back and runs his business.

Used to be such a good joint. Pizza quality has gone downhill; haven’t been in there for a few years but I think the staffing has changed too. These guys sound like @$$holes.

Tbh if you’re still rocking with Christian’s at all you’re kidding yourself, that place has and always be garbage.

And their pizza ain't even good.

This is heartbreaking. As a transfer I thought this place was a staple of UVA culture. Guess not!!

Ofc Christians gets cancelled a week before graduation 💀. o7 Christian’s

Me and my friends went there during the pandemic & they said they wouldn’t serve us unless we took our masks off because the pandemic wasn’t ‘real’

Christians on 5th street is fantastic !!

It sounds like they don't need your money.

Religion is cancer

Used to hang a bit with Christian years ago, this doesn’t reflect him at all but I’m sure he’ll sort it as it does have his name on it.

This is the complete opposite of my past experiences. I used to use my now wife to get the creepy owner’s attention and cut the shit show weekend drunk night line

Been yelled at a lot as a guy there as well🤣. I put it up with it for the good pizza though Lol

That's terrible! I'm so sorry you had that experience. There are too many great places on the Corner to give that place our business.

Went there for the Brazilian music thing last week. Good pizza(and I don’t even like pizza)

It’s cheaper

There’s like 5 of them across the state so it isn’t a front. It’s just not great lol

Yes, I’ve been told they are all independently owned.

Would be nice to let the 5th Street location know that the other one is dragging down the brand.

Not me, but three young women on staff. Some of the replies I’m getting make me think this isn’t uncommon.

There was more said, but I think telling three young women "we serve men first" should be horrible enough to make any reasonable person go elsewhere.

I’m so sorry to hear this. I am disappointed (and honestly a little angry) by some to the stories I’m hearing. The Corner is a different scene at night, but that doesn’t mean people should be treated poorly just for wanting a late night slice of pizza.

Vita Nova is fantastic NY-style pizza. Amazing crust and a perfect ratio of bread, sauce, and cheese.

Bodo’s is much more of an institution. The Corner location opened in 2005 (after having a “coming soon” sign ten years!).

Close, Christian’s on the DTM is the Charlottesville institution. These other places were so he could grab some cash.

You win the loathsome award.

I must have missed the part where they talked about religion in the post......

Coming from Jersey, I am worried about the “good pizza” comment. 🤣

They’re each independently owned.

I agree on that - I just hope that they don’t try to deny on face value because it’s a bit harder to get them to change. Judging from the other comment it seems like a pattern that won’t stop, so can be harder to deny. I wish you the best in trying to spread the word now as it’s summer, but would definitely recommend getting coverage in the fall. I’m sure between a Daily Progress article, bad reviews, and lack of foot traffic will show that this type of behavior is unacceptable. Someone posted your instagram post on YikYak and it’s taking off. If there’s something you need from us - aside from spreading the word and abstaining from Christian’s - please let us know.

As someone from Chicago, your perception of good pizza is very skewed 🤣🤣

The cheese and pepperoni pizza slices remind me of the pizza from our family's favorite hole-in-the-wall pizza place on the boardwalk at Wildwood, New Jersey, so the fond mini family reunion memories may distort my opinion, but I like it a lot.

UVA’s newest email in summary

Anyone for preemptive infection? If I get sick now I should be good for 3 months lol

After everyone from (regional) Georgetown and Johns Hopkins, to (national) Harvard and Stanford to, just this week, regional friend/ally/rival/'enemy' (!) UNC/Chapel Hill, and a long list of smaller/less prestigious schools, has by now decided that it's more prudent to go to online classes this Fall, this alumni is seriously questioning UVa's (opaque to the point of basically being completely impossible to discern if you're not inside the higher reaches of the Administration), er, 'thinking' on this admittedly complex and difficult issue. It's obvious to many, many observers that in-person re-opening will be followed by inevitable clusters of CoVid illnesses and outbreaks and will then lead to... ta dah! ...online classes for the Fall... but will have, in the meantime, spread and stirred the virus not just among 1000's and 1000's of 'repeat traveling' students, but their teachers, administrators, friends, family and the many 'townies' who have had to be in contact with them. What a mess.

I mean it’s inevitable so that’s not a huge concern as long as it’s under control.

Base on IFR data, college-aged people will be just fine. https://www.acsh.org/news/2020/06/23/coronavirus-covid-deaths-us-age-race-14863

Our goals are beyond their understanding

I mean I'd rather keep my lungs but to each their own I guess

This is true in the short term, but I think we can all agree that we’d rather not get covid than get covid. Also, getting the virus and not knowing you have it is probably worse as you might spread it to others. Keep in mind many Americans are considered high risk due to preexisting conditions like high blood pressure, high cholesterol etc. We could also spread it to service industry workers inadvertently or even our very own staff and faculty, who are more at risk. Not only that, but the long term health effects of this virus are unknown, my friend, who got covid a month ago, still can’t taste fully. Though I don’t want to make a mountain out of a mole hill I think that it’s odd uva is shifting their tone saying that even when students get infected we can still call it a success, but that it’s also 100% on students to minimize that spread. They preach student responsibility all the while uva is doing wildly irresponsible things like selling football tickets, allowing those who don’t have any reason to live in on grounds housing live on grounds, refusing to budge on tuition, and placing a 6 week limit on housing refunds(among other things). So yes, you’re right, we’ll probably be fine, but a lot of other people won’t, and uva shouldn’t be let of the hook for that.

Then stay away from people and wear a mask?

Is someone taking your lungs?

That's kinda hard to do when you have people returning to campus. For first years you've got shared bathrooms with everybody in the hall, and everybody has to deal with others for dining and in-person classes, as well as other people in the building you live* in *Edit: spelling

The number of COVID patients who have lost their lungs would indicate that, yes, COVID has a chance of taking my lungs if I got infected

Here’s an idea, don’t go

Damage yes, high likelihood of “losing” your lungs no.

I'm not planning on going. That doesn't change the fact that UVa is sacrificing students to COVID to get money

Tell me again where I said there was a "high likelihood"? Also, yes, it is definitely possible that you can have permanent damage to your lungs: >Experts are concerned a significant proportion could be left with lung scarring, known as pulmonary fibrosis. >The condition is irreversible and symptoms can include severe shortness of breath, coughing and fatigue. >https://www.bbc.com/news/health-53065340 And yes, there are cases where patients have literally lost both lungs and had to have transplants: https://www.nm.org/about-us/northwestern-medicine-newsroom/press-releases/2020/meet-the-two-covid19-double-lung-transplant-patients

What would you want them to do? UVA is giving students the choice to go or not go. The fact is, the majority of students want to go. Hopefully, they can act responsibly. The good news is that things are trending in the right direction in Virginia, so I don't see how there would be justification to go all online at this point unless there is a dramatic shift over the next week.

I’m going back because I cannot focus on school in my current home environment and I’d argue a lot of people suffer academically with the distractions of home life.

You had a choice, they're not forcing anything on you or anyone else. Sounds like you just want to complain.

>UVA is giving students the choice to go or not go. The fact is, the majority of students want to go. That's the problem. UVa's admitted there's going to be COVID cases, they know that the students aren't going to act responsibility, and they're still opening Grounds (knowing that students are going to want to go) to get money. They don't have the testing or tracing infrastructure in place to contain something of this size (one free test every *60 days*?? Come on), and it's just not likely to end in any good way >Hopefully, they can act responsibly Is...is this a joke? We know they can't, we saw it at the midsummer's parties and at UNC. Obviously, they can't fully be expected to, being college students who have been cooped up for 6 months, but you're simply in denial if you expect then to act in any other way. >things are trending in the right direction in Virginia That's because we're still in lockdown...how do you think things are going to change once colleges open? >I don't see how there would be justification to go all online at this point unless there is a dramatic shift over the next week. The fact that other colleges like UNC had to do so after *one week*, and considering how JMU and W&M are likely going to go the same way, I think there's plenty of justification.

And that's your choice, and that's good for you. But the fact is UVa is woefully underprepared for having students back on Grounds, they know it, and they're willing to go through with it anyway just for money

1. Professors are more or less being forced to return to Grounds 2. People living in Charlottesville don't have a choice, and are being forced to be exposed to UVa students; when an outbreak inevitably happens, they will suffer the most 3: Regardless of whether they're forcing people or not, they are clearly making a blatantly reckless decision that could cost lives, and deserve to be called out

Job market is so cooked UVA sent an out a sympathy email Do we smell a recession incoming?

Already here

For the person who commented that they didn’t understand and had seen many job openings - here is an educational response for you. 1)many jobs currently listed as “entry level” require 3+ years of experience, which make people who are actually “entering” after school unqualified. 2)hiring companies will post job availabilities knowing full well they are hiring internally, making those openings “ghost postings.” 3)many companies are now using AI to “read” through resumes. Any that the AI cannot read are immediately discarded and often the applicant is never told why. 4)the process of selecting an employee is taking longer and longer. Internships/jobs that take months and multiple test projects are not worth anyone’s time. 5)the political scene right now has made many companies post availability, hire, and then have to drop their new hires due to funding cuts. 6)A job that pays $18/hr in the DC area is essentially a small stipend, not a liveable wage. Offering that to someone with a master’s, as many companies have been doing, is laughable. TLDR: just because you see a lot of “we’re hiring!” signs and listings on handshake doesn’t mean there are enough jobs to go around. We are currently searing on high heat in the pot, almost fully cooked.

What was the email

The next few years are going to be the most consequential we’ve had in a long time (certainly since the GFC, probably longer). CS students specifically, I’m truly sorry. You’ve been led to believe your hard work on that degree is a certain path to a fruitful and safe career. That will continue to be true for some, but a significant number of others will be left holding the bag. The collapse of the job market in that area came very quickly. ChatGPT and LLMs in general weren’t widely available when you started school. But the reality is quickly evolving. What I’d recommend to you all still in school and without a job is be intentional about evaluating your career path going forward. UVA alums are happy to talk if you have a good reason and genuine interest in what they do (don’t spam inboxes). In this world you HAVE to know someone that can influence the hiring process to get a job. The days of filling out 100 cold applications and getting 5-10 interviews are over. Every sexy job opening will get thousands of apps if they even are planning to hire externally. Ask yourself these questions: 1. What do I enjoy doing? What brings my happiness beyond the fact it’ll provide me with a paycheck? 2. Can I draw links between my values, my personality, and my fulfillment needs in life? 3. Based on those links, what other career options would make sense and keep me (and family if that’s in the cards) happy, fulfilled, and full Take it from this alum, I’m pulling for you all but you gotta act now. Literally examine every non traditional option that fulfills the criteria. Take your parents with a grain of salt, they grew up in the pension era. And also, don’t become an asshole who takes advantage of others. Too much of that these days. Keep your dignity. Go Hoos, and good luck

LinkedIn is a POS with nothing but misleading ghost jobs

We've been through this about 10 years ago or so. I remember going to a Mexican restaurant with my UVA gear on. When our waiter approached, he said Wahoowa! I was a bit surprised. It wasn't summer time. He told me he graduated but couldn't find a job, so he grabbed the waiter gig. Another UVA grad I ran into was at the ATT store... he was selling phones. I remember thinking, WTF? At that point, you'd have been better off not spending all that tuition money to get a job that a GED person could get. Or use that money towards trade school (AC company, plumbing, mechanic). Later on, I realized, at least the waiter, the ATT sales guy were not just sitting around waiting for something that may not come. They were already out earning some money and gaining some experience in the real world... esp one where you have to deal with actual ppl. So long story short, yeah, it may suck to get a "shitty" job right after 4 years of college, but that's better than sitting around and not getting any income. You can still be looking at the same time you're working the "lesser job". I worked the career fairs for my company at UVA for many years in the past decade....amazing candidates always. Made it tough to select who we made offers to. Now that number has shrunk for sure. 😞

Post the email. And 2008/9 grads are laughing at you. They didn't even get an email. Just a pink slip

I'm a UVA alum who works in international development. Our industry has completely collapsed over the past 5 months. Not only did I lose my job (as did my fiancée), but I couldn't just find another job in my industry- the industry is gone. My coworkers and I have all had to completely start over. It has felt apocalyptic in some ways, as dramatic as that may sound. All that to say- yeah, it's bad.

Can someone post the text? Curious to read it.

Yeah, the main advantage a grad would have in this shrinking job market would be cheaper labor. Lots of places place priority on having experience. How are you supposed to have experience if no one gives you a chance. It's almost like a double whammy. So many places are tightening up overhead costs. At this point you'd almost have to know someone to get in or be a super super amazing candidate. I hope it gets better soon....I know there's a lot of seasoned workers already looking since they got laid off. That's just more competition for grads to go against getting these fewer job opportunities.

Good luck to all you CS degree holders - seems like you're going to be left holding the bag

UVA Today emails are really stretching to put out "good news" lately

Is this real?

Uh…my company is hiring a ton of people in the suburbs of DC. Good GPAs from UVA and VaTech totally get interviews. We are actively competing against lots of companies for folks. Maybe its something other than the job market. We are an engineering firm so maybe other degrees are having issues

Stop bringing kids into this fucked up world. They're just going to deal with stress, debt and hardship their entire life.

Maybe someone will let the Fed know. They are saying the strong employment market is why they are not cutting rates. Hopefully, they signal cuts at the next meeting.

Well...you all could start an Only Fans account if you are a hot guy with a good piece...jyst sayin...or become a TikTok creator!

Depends on what you are applying for and yes what experience. One thing that hurts is getting a major in an area that is not marketable

We’ve been in a recession for like 2-3 years, we’re prolly entering a depression now

Welcome to being a millennial graduating from 2008-14 sucked. Least people right now are asking if this is a recession there was no doubt back then

Agreed but it won't be official till this quarter's lower GDP numbers are released

Plus there is no job at all behind some “ghost postings.” Companies post fake openings for a variety of reasons, for example, to signal that they are growing, to get a read on candidates and salaries, etc. In these cases, the job is not filled internally but never came open at all.

its wild that people have no understanding of what anecdotal data/information means too. Its like saying "The has no inequality, 5/10 people at my job are minorities" or "The economy is great, I just got a raise last month"

Yep, and lots of companies are not counting internships as experience either. Hiring managers are also blatantly discriminating against Gen Z applicants and refuse to even grant them interviews. All of these things are making it extremely difficult for recent grads to enter the job market.

7)some also assign take-home tests to applicants, then ghost them and use their work for free. Maybe it's high time we take the fight to them and waste their time using AI. There's already a surge in fake applications.

“Dear Third Year Students: I hope you are doing well as the semester wraps up. Spring has been beautiful, and I hope you’ve found time to enjoy it! I was thrilled to begin my new role as UVA’s Dean of Students on March 24. It is truly an honor to be selected for this important position, and it has been a highlight for me to attend student performances, meetings, and events. Coming from the leadership of the UVA Career Center, I recognize the difficulty of today’s job market, and the resulting rescinding of internship and job offers for many students. We are committed to providing you with resources during this uneasy time. I am pleased to share that the UVA career services community, in partnership with the Alumni Association, Office of Alumni Engagement, Student Financial Services, and Advancement, is launching an outreach campaign to alumni and friends of UVA to invite them to host Summer 2025 projects and internships, and to share any full-time job opportunities. We are also grateful for the generous support of the UVA Parents Council, which has provided funding to support internship stipends for undergraduate third-year students engaging in unpaid internships. We will be working to source a range of remote (and some in person) opportunities across industries and functions. I recognize the great need, so we hope this can be another avenue to help your search process. While it will be challenging to support every student, we hope to assist with some positive outcomes. We invite you to share your status: I have secured an unpaid internship and would like to be considered for grants. Please complete this brief survey. OR I am actively seeking and would like to learn about internship and project opportunities available through UVA alumni. Please complete this brief survey. Once you respond to the survey that aligns with your status, we will add you to an email list so you receive alerts about how to pursue grant funds or where you can access project/internship opportunities. While the experiences offered by UVA alumni may differ from your original objectives for this summer, we encourage you to be open and to leverage these opportunities to build skills and expand your career story. Additionally, our career advisors remain available to help you with strategies around your resume, applications, interviewing, and searches. Please schedule an appointment anytime through Handshake. We look forward to staying in touch to offer both support and access to opportunities and resources. Best wishes as you finish up the semester. Please remember the importance of self-care, maintaining a positive outlook, and asking for help when you need it. Warm regards, Dean Hall”

I’m a Virginia Tech alum, and I’d be happy to talk. Hokies for Hoos, solidarity from someone who exited grad school in 2008. ❤️

I’m sorry. That really sucks.

Yep. I saw a guy ahead of me graduate and then was at next years career fair. Was a part of Bear Stearns collapse

*laughs in early 1990s graduate*

What would you say for someone who didn't have such a great GPA? but compensated for it by having a lot more hands on experience? Which do you think most companies prefer?

Link to HR?

My company is hiring. Must be located in Charlottesville area and be open to hybrid work (2-3 days per week in office to start). They are sales positions assisting businesses secure financing for equipment acquisitions. Looking to hire 2-3 at first and another 2-3 in Aug/Sept. Base salary plus unlimited commissions. OTE will get you into 6 figures. May not be related to your field of study but sales is a skill that can be leveraged throughout your career.

always has been that way

I think the feds are being fooled by the deliberate push of companies to make it seem as if everything is fine (I have no idea what companies benefit from doing this but it’s probably something).

Two quarters of negative GDP doesn’t make for a recession anymore…[gestures vaguely at 2022]

Yes! I wish this was more widely known/talked about/cracked down on. So 175,000 new jobs were posted last month. Ok, most of them are probably not even real, it’s a tool used to artificially make the unemployment rate look better. I’ve been saying this to anyone that will listen for many years. Job searching fucking sucks. You can apply to 50 jobs you’re completely qualified for and hear nothing back, easily. Not even an interview, not even a chance.

Damn I feel like I didn't even get an email like that when I graduated in 2009

Welp, we’re screwed. Don’t you just love being sandwiched between the pandemic and a self-inflicted recession as soon as you become an adult?

Thoughtful of them to reach out to alumni for projects/internships. It's not easy to snag an internship and especially this job market where people are losing their jobs left and right.

Fascinating … as an alarm graduated in the late 80s and a business owner in Virginia, I was never asked to provide an internship or anything like they are discussing. Along those lines, I want all students to understand that it’s time to find a job the old-fashioned way. Applying for nonexistent jobs on the Internet is not going to cut it. There are too many comments here about fake jobs being listed and AI screening resumes. You have to start building your own professional network. Start with your professors. Ask them what graduates they have taught that they would recommend you connecting with. Go on informational interviews to learn more about people and the jobs they do. Ask them who else they would recommend you talking to. UVa alumni love their own. And I have seen comments that I consider relatively bullshit where they say you have to be privileged in order to give advice like this. Well, my response is that UVA is widely thought of as an extremely strong college. That alone is a privilege. Students are going to have to do the hard work to land a job in this economy. That is absolutely fair and true. But let’s get out there and do the hard work. Time to get gritty.

Laughing because the job market wasn’t great then either.

Right and it's fucked up! Give the earth back to the animals and mother nature!

More likely it’s the federal government making it seem like things are fine while companies sound the alarm. But something is screwy with this data. You have Dollar General execs saying people are straight up out of money but supposedly independent agencies are saying people still have plenty of disposable income (I just heard this from an industry expert on a Zoom call last week). I don’t buy it. Somebody is lying.

Companies will benefit if the Fed introduces stimulus. The last thing they want to do is fool the Fed into not lowering interest rates.

Yep. Frustrating. Imagine now though that instead of just sending a resume, you actually went on interviews for a bunch of nonexistent jobs. That is the situation for many actors. Union rules require producers to hold auditions, so they hold auditions for roles that, behind the scenes, are already cast. Should we discard the union rule? No, because every so often someone breaks through or makes an impression now that grows into a role later in a different production. So as a job seeker (1) keep plugging away; (2) use the fact that not every opening is real to take the pressure off yourself, relax, play with it, take some chances, etc.; and (3) look for ways to make your own opportunities. Look at all the actors who came through stand-up comedy in recent years. They made a way to do the work on their own. Then the jobs came to them. That example might not translate to all worlds, but maybe some pieces are useful. In fact, it sometimes applies to another marketplace called dating. Some people go on dates not because they have any romantic interest in you but to get out of the house, be seen, be in the mix, etc. You can be upset about “being used” or you can adjust to the reality. It certainly takes the pressure off any given date. So be yourself, and if they don’t turn your way, then you, too, were out and in the mix. You turn more heads out there than sitting home.

Mass layoffs affecting recent grads UVA is a big feeder for careers in public service. I personally lost my job because of the layoffs and cuts happening in the federal government, and I’m seeing a lot of friends and fellow UVA recent grads affected on LinkedIn. I feel for fellow recent grads who just started their career and now have lost their job. I honestly don’t know what to do myself. Many of us spent years planning to get to where we are just to lose it all. And for some of us, it’s not like we can easily find a new job. The international development sector in particular has been decimated and the federal government is being dismantled. So much grief

I’m so sorry. I’m a UVA grad and Fed and very worried about everything going on.

God I feel for you! I’m in this area w 4 years of professional experience and I’ve gone into work every day this month wondering if it’s going to be my last day. I’m applying for jobs right now and I’m already seeing that I’m competing with 80+ applicants so everyone must be in the same boat

This is very reminiscent of when I graduated in 2009. Ended up waiting tables for several years just to stay afloat.

You will get the job again, but likely only after you pledge fealty to the President.

Since when is a government job guaranteed?

Gonna have to make a productive living in the private sector 🤷‍♂️

So this should teach you a lesson…prioritize a career in the private sector. 20 years ago, I had a ton of interviews during 4th year while finishing out at SEAS. Among those were a few federal / federal adjacent jobs. Every DC / nova based federal job interview was miserable and boring. The people conducting the interviews were dull, the jobs generally vague in description, and every interview had heavy focus placed on explaining how to game / traverse a gs compensation scale. Despite getting offers or invites to final onsite interviews to most of these positions, I couldn’t imagine parking my career before it even started in a system that goes out of its way to disincentivize risk taking, innovation, and professional growth. There is a big world out there awash in cash and with lots of real problems that need solving. Go out and try your hand at that first…

You do work for the govt without being a contractor. If you feel like nit picking between contractor and supplier or whatever else distinction you're making, fine. It doesn't change anything.

ha! i had to do this in 2002. On the bright side it really was fun times.

I work in the private sector on federal work and we have also laid off hundreds already. Hope this helps!

Got any job leads in the private sector? Or just being an asshole?? There's not a single doubt that this will hurt private sector workforce as well, within the year. Save this post.

You depend on the government more than your toaster of a brain can understand btw

All the public sector people are taking all of the private sector jobs.

I hear what you’re saying but I hope you’re able to think a bit more about your position. Things aren’t this black and white — maybe some goverment positions were bullshit, but we are also loosing tons of very important employees who pour their heart into helping America be a better place by proving services to every citizen.

The world is more complex than your limited personal experiences from 2005. Hope this helps!

This is the capitalist world we are in right now when people are dehumanized as capitals only to make more money in the business

You wanted a cushy job with low expectations and great job security, and suddenly that's not available. Time to take what you can get, and try to learn skills that the private sector values.

That's not my problem. I should've been more empathetic, thing is that it is my deep seated belief that the majority of government work is detrimental and hurts real people too. OP is the hurt you see, but you can't see the business that never starts, you can't see the connection to the family suffering from inflation. You don't see the connection between government power and excessive incarceration. I came across as hostile, and it is because I get worked up in the hostile environment (to my beliefs) of Reddit. Sorry about that. Your mom's a good lay tho.

I don't agree with that. I am aware of roads btw.

It really isn’t. People who make a series of bad long term choices use the old things are “more complex” excuse. Don’t look to the federal government to solve any of your day to day problems AND certainly don’t depend on them for employment…you will be just fine.

I am not a contractor or an employee in the govt. Hope this helps!

Really ain't beating the asshole accusations are you?

You are generalizing the "fed" jobs. Some jobs are definitely like that. Some actually serve a purpose. Think a little bit.

How is a public sector job any more "real" than other types of jobs?

“Majority of government work is detrimental and hurts real people” Man they just let anyone into uva huh

You know, Tony Bennett thinks you're a loser and a dick.

Oh my bad everyone. The world is exactly as simple as Reddit user Odd_Literature_2496’s limited personal experiences from 2005. You will be just fine! <3

They wanted a life of leisure on the backs of the working class. I'm not the ass here.

I'm hard pressed to think of any that aren't overpaid and underworked. And many many of the jobs are a net negative to society.

"life of leisure on the backs of the working class" yes famously not what happens in the private sector

Exactly! Down with the evil capitalist fat cats! Rise the proletariat!

Federal workers get paid super low, Just look up a GS pay sheet. Very few people get paid a private sector salary because they bring a lot to the government in terms or expertise and skills.

Overpaid??? Federal workers make about 30% less than those in the private sector.

I'm not sure what the logic in your second sentence means - it seems to say that govt workers are paid little because they have lots of expertise and skills? They are paid little because they have high benefits, high job security, a sense of "doing good" in their work and low expectations. If they would get paid more in the private sector, you've got to ask yourself why they aren't doing that instead.

They don't do the same work as private sector workers.

yapping about high job security in a thread about mass layoffs is nasty work.

they are working in the government because they want to SERVE THEIR COUNTRY.

I meant to say "but they bring"... not "because" My bad on the typo, I didn't even notice.

No, I work HARDER in my Fed job than I had in most of my private sector jobs.

Tell that to the doctors, lawyers, nurses, and engineers that work for the government. They not only do the same work, they often have higher caseloads. If you’re mad that federal workers have employment protections and private employees dont, then your concern is actually with the private sector.

You mean the voluntary layoffs in govt that are affecting a new grad? This is not a thread about someone losing their cushy govt job, it's about them not being able to get it in the first place.

We'll I guess they get to SERVE FRIES WITH THAT

Your take from this post is that OP left their job voluntarily..? Are you sure you're not a Tech plant?

Thank you from a Charlottesville resident As a resident of Charlottesville, I was opposed to UVA’s plan to bring students back because of the possibility that students could fuel a major COVID outbreak here. I thought for sure that by mid-October UVA would either be entirely virtual or would be fueling a massive surge in COVID cases that we would be dealing with. But according to the COVID-19 Thomas Jefferson Health District Portal (https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/thomas-jefferson/tjhd-covid-19-data-portal/), the current 7-day rolling average of new COVID cases is currently less than it was in August. I know how much students are sacrificing for public health and safety. Reading the posts on this subreddit, it is clear that the sacrifices are mental and emotional as well. I just want to say THANK YOU for everything you are doing to keep people safe. I know that all your work can be thankless, but I am truly grateful to see a low COVID count at the moment. And sure, these numbers can still spike. Everything can still go to shit. But everything students and residents have done so far to keep our local numbers down (even while they spike nationally) is working. Please keep it up and don’t get discouraged.

this is so kind! Thank you C'ville resident for taking the time to tell us this, and much appreciation to all C'ville residents for your sacrifices as well. We're a community in this together.

As someone who is really struggling mentally rn and questioning my earlier decision to stay home, thank you... I needed to hear this

this is so nice to hear. im a cville townie and uva student and its reassuring to hear that the community doesnt hate us lmao

This sounds exactly like what my engineering professor said today in class. Professor Dart is that you?

Always look on the bright side of life

totally unrelated, but just thought of a pickup line: *are you UVa's prevalence testing? cos you make me drool*

i tested positive and wasn’t even partying or doing anything non cautionary. stay safe out there

Why is so much saliva needed? It's honestly wack.

Can you get the UK variant even if you’ve had covid before?

*are you UVa's prevalence testing? cuz you make me salivate*

Same. They didn't tell me if I have the U.K. variant, but wouldn't be surprised. I figured I was going to get it at some point, kinda surprised I made it this far. Was hoping to be vaccinated before this point, but c'est la vie and thank you terrible vaccine rollout. At least those who are really vulnerable are finally getting it in large numbers.

Did you go to the grocery store or something?

They need enough to amplify the viral RNA in order to detect the virus. Still sucks that we need so much, but I'd honestly rather spend 20 mins coming up with enough spit instead of having a Super Q-Tip get shoved up into my nose, but that's just my opinion.

The first time I did prevalence testing I had so much trouble getting enough saliva. I was there for almost 30 minutes and the lady kept asking if I was okay.

Because that's as deep as the robotic arm can reach inside the tubes.... I wish I was joking. They only use a tiny bit.

I’m an athlete and was likely exposed to a first year teammate that was staying in gibbons- which had an outbreak. the first kid that tested positive was not supposed to be at practice, he wasn’t cleared to be at practice, but he slipped under the coaching staff’s radar. so even by trying my best to follow guidelines i still test positive.. being an athlete is much higher risk though.

Nope. They only use a tiny amount. The limitation is that the robitic arm that takes the sample in the robotic testing sequencer machine, can only go so deep in the tube. So you have to fill it to that point. So that's the reason for the large volume. I think they only use a couple microliters.

The qtip isn't really that bad and they can do.a throat swab...

Are you a swimmer?

Huh, color me surprised

Why wouldn’t they just design the tube to be smaller or the robotic arm to be longer? That explanation doesn’t make any sense.

I think the machine is made for blood tubes originally, which are about this size. Probably the only size that fits.

And the nasal ones arnt necessary. In my opinion they should be phased by now because it makes people scared of testing. Except they can be essential for non-cooperating children. Throat swabs are more common now and more tolerated. These tests are so sensitive, they can detect covid19 in freaking dorm sewage water. It only take a small amount of saliva/mucous/poop from any part of the oral/nasal/rectal cavity can be used. Even diluted.

They didn't design it. They are using the tools they have available, because there is a global shortage for machines of this kind. So they are making the best with what they can get.

Mood for the game tonight

Well this aged well...

Cincinnati delenda est.

My brother went to Ohio University so tonight is a very big deal for me. If we choke I might have to block his number

OU isn’t in cincinnati tho *athens delenda est

Was going for something that started with "C" and was close-ish to OU and in Ohio. 😄

Too bad most students missed the thrilling 4th quarter comeback

As someone who stayed for the whole game, I’ve literally never seen UVA football win a home comeback of more than 1 score in my three years here. I can’t blame people too much. Maybe win some games and things will start to change

A 4-1 start can’t erase 15 years of UVA football being mostly bad. For the entire conscious lives of these students, UVA football has not been a serious endeavor.

Yea I dunno why people are so quick to flip on students. UVA does absolutely nothing to make fan experience better, and more so proactively makes it worse. Also what about the other 20,000 seats they couldn’t fill? Why don’t they get any flak? Students showed up for half the game at least, those seats never had anyone. Edit: I posted about the UVA football experience being terribly run a few weeks ago. I want to add that overall there needs to be a major culture shift by the school itself, specifically the AD and Admin. This post exemplifies that the school would sooner put bandaid solutions on larger issues or cause other issues, then attempt at large scale remedies.

Winning cures all, but it isn’t overnight. If I lived anywhere close to Cville or even Virginia as a whole I’d still be going at least once or twice. However noon for homecoming is good for old alums but not for students. Frats and sororities doing their thing with alumni at their houses, everyone else with other things to do. Considering the Maryland game, I can see the new fans being like ok been there done that. Culture change takes a long while. We’re on the right trajectory but fan healing will take time

Students have been leaving at halftime for the last 30+ years. Where tf has Jerry Ratcliffe been that he doesn’t know that this is how things work at UVA?

It was horrific in the 70s, and more people showed up. Noon games have always been an issue, but really, that was embarrassing for everyone, season ticket holders included. The culture has eroded for a lot of different reasons.

Maybe they shouldn't deny reentry

I was there. A 12 PM start is brutal. If this game was at 7 pm, it would’ve been packed. Amazing game all things considered.

I'd prefer to see the crowds with 4 minutes left on the clock By the time this picture was taken we were up by 10, had 1st and 10 on the bc 11, and the next 3 plays were a run and two knees Both teams were ready to be done at this point too

People gotta stop scheduling darties to start at halftime. This is embarrassing

Give students better seating

UVA students show up for so many games/matches beyond what's on TV. The school spirit here is great and I don't think the students deserve this criticism. A noon game at Scott Stadium means it's blazing hot in the student section and they look into the sun the entire time. I wouldn't last, either. For what it's worth, we used to walk over to the hill for a quarter just to enjoy the atmosphere and see the students. I imagine others did the same. I understand why the rules were put in place and they are adjusting those rules, but it doesn't change the fact that some of us aren't welcome there anymore.

There’s no entertainment value at the games. Same thing every year for the past 40 years. Spice it up. On tv it literally sounds like 15,000 people having conversations in a cafeteria. Don’t believe me, go to another stadium. Other schools do things during timeouts and between quarters. They play songs, fans sing, loudly. Start by going to a Penn State white out game and listen to Living On a Prayer. That’s what college football sounds like, not cafeteria conversations. UVA games are boring. That’s why people don’t show or leave.

There are ways to have fun at games, even while losing. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AKNiVBqFDM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AKNiVBqFDM)

Yeah, the student crowd was weak.

I don’t know why anyone would be mad. Football is alright but by far the best part is tailgating before, watching the pregame and halftime shows, and hanging with your friends until you get sunburnt. When you have a mid team, unless something really exciting is happening, there is no reason to stay the whole time.

I stayed, but I'm not a student. I had a feeling they'd get the win.

Worst fans in college football. They did the same for the JMU game last year because of a little rain.

Stop the security theatre and let people go out at halftime! Even when teams were bad in the 80s, people would go to watch, go out at halftime and then come back. They also seem to have complicated the hill although honestly no one ever liked standing there compared to seats. I attended in the 80s as a student and have gone to less games every year but still on occasion. My impression is they keep adding more rules year after year. Also, a lot of students used to enjoy the pep band before the game because it was funny as hell. A lot of what was cool about going to UVa games is now meh, but I’m just an old geezer. Maybe current students just aren’t used to winning seasons or seasons without horrible things. Also noon games have always sucked for students and now they suck for old people too because the traffic around Charlottesville is more horrible every year and you can’t get there in time. And forget staying in a hotel the night before - they want the whole weekend and charge like $300 or more a night for essentially a Red Roof Inn. Thank you for listening to my geezing.

I would much rather masturbate than to watch a football game. I like jerking off on the knees of old ladies and then bending them over

A 4-1 start against sub par teams, it doesn’t mean much. At least UVA will get a bowl game this year if they can squeak out 2 more wins.

Nothing better than a beautiful fall day and college football. Something very wrong with a “darty” during football game times. Who would even do that? Turn in your man card at the door please.

Honestly I’m just fed up, this team always finds a way to let me down, I’m not gonna go to the 4th Side and watch my team lose, I can do that in the comfort of my dorm room. This season has been an exception but yeah

I used to work in/around UVA Athletics. A couple years ago, we had a big meeting about improving student attendance. I shared my viewpoint that UVA needed to significantly increase Wi-Fi accessibility in the stadium. While this is true for everyone, it is especially true for current students. Asking students to go four hours without checking their apps is an absolute nonstarter. I explained that UVA needed to install enough Internet bandwidth so that 40,000 people could stream videos of other games, check their Instagram reels, or surf Facebook/Reddit during halftime during commercials. My suggestion was that the administration fully wire the student section of the stadium, even if it meant diminishing Internet access for ticket-buyers. This is not a trade-off that should be required - ideally UVA would have great WiFi in the whole building. But if there is a limited amount of bandwidth, UVA would do well to Wire the student sections to have faster Internet than the rest of the stadium. It is absolutely mandatory for the student experience to be able to check their phone during the game. The senior administrator looked me dead in the face, and said, “ there is no way that is true. We can do other things to keep students attention. They can go four hours without being on their phone.” They are freaking clueless.

Noon was bad for this old alum. I couldn’t even get my first year to get out of bed to come tailgate with us. and it was hot. We all stayed to the end (except my first year who left after 3rd quarter bc well, this thread) and it was a fun win eventually. But yes things are a far cry from the much more glorious days of the early 90’s. I hope we’re getting back to that.

Definitely not true until the end of the Groh era. (2009ish)

i am not a UVA student, but this popped up in my feed and i have to ask… that lawn is the student section?? that seems genuinely crazy to me, there’s no way i’d ever see over the guy in front of me, and the thought of rain is just… terrifying, honestly.

that’s standard for any sporting event, maybe you all shouldn’t leave the absolute second things are not great 🙄

Yea it was hot out and it kept getting hotter throughout the day, made me wanna go home

Pretty rough time of day to wear dress shirt and tie in the sun.

Nah it still would’ve emptied out at halftime when the frat parties/alumni events start. In general, 3:30 pm kicks are the best so people can wake up, tailgate for a decent amount of time, go to the game, then be able to do whatever evening activity they had planned, although specific to Homecomings, noon is probably the time that least conflicts with any University events like YAR and alumni dinners

this was basically how it was after midway through 2Q, at least in terms of students — my section (bottom left corner) thinned out a liiiitle bit after halftime but was mostly intact until the end

How is a darty more fun than a game anyway?

Closing the Hill killed the vibe. This is where the non-students hang out along with the smaller kids. Take that away and they don’t want to go to games and their parents don’t go as well to sit in the stands. The Hill environment was the only unique thing about the games. Open it back up to everyone. Don’t want visiting fans to take over? Put more of your own on the Hill, squeeze them out. Closing the Hill made it sound like UVa is scared that visiting teams are going to show and rush their field after wins.

Just saying...that was a night game.

It was a pretty exciting game

bro, it was pouring and they literally evacuated the stadium at that game. be so for real

It was hot as hell and the offense was anemic until the fourth quarter. Don’t blame the students for leaving at all. Team looked like shit for 75% of the game.

I am right there with you.

It’s also crazy cause good phone access is critical for coordinating large groups and capturing the experience. God I hate UVA admin so much they’re so incompetent.

Completely fair. I was in marching band so noon= be ready at 6:30-7am (the worst….) but for the love of the Hoos and band in that order I did it. I think we are, and Tony is getting us closer. my only fear is with NIL and lack of fan support we might hit a critical point of constantly being mid at best . We are dealing with high school recruits— visuals in the stands do matter. I hope more fans show soon. Also worth mentioning home side does show up well. The away sideline side (minus students except during breaks) is big yikes

I was there in the late 90s during the Welsh era, students left at halftime even back then.

If it hasn't changed, the student section is the hill and pretty much all the actual seating you can see on this pic on the far side of the field. The band takes up one of the lower sections though.

Still a dumb policy, doesn’t matter if it’s standard

Other college stadiums do allow reentry.

It hasn't always been that way. Pre 9/11 everyone complained fans were too slow returning to their seats after halftime lol They absolutely should start letting students reenter again.

bruh its free for students why do they care lol. people dont leave for professional sport events bc theyre actually fans but uva football games are more just a social hangout

Those of y'all planning on partying in large groups tonight: which costume are you wearing?

Dressing up as Dean Groves and going from house to house.

Wow you sure got him

Omg masterbating? NO NO ONE MASTERBATES ON MY CHRISTIAN UNIVERSITY SUBreddit!!!!! Save your So0ul. Healthy relationships W1tH your body are THE FORBIDDEN FRUIT 🍆 🍑

I apologize for upvoting you, stranger. May you find the thing you seek

Despicable journalism. What exactly made the peaceful protest change? Maybe the armed police, getting pepper sprayed maybe?

UVA Today is a UVA run organization, this is effectively a press release.

Implying the protestors turned violent all of a sudden is so misleading and it’s very disappointing to see them pushing this narrative

Here's a link to the article: [Demonstration Ends After Protesters Refuse to Comply with University Policy](https://news.virginia.edu/content/demonstration-ends-after-protesters-refuse-comply-university-policy) After reading the write-up, the subheading is misleading. There is no mention of violence on Friday night, although it does state, "Around 11:45 a.m. \[on Saturday\], University police and local officers arrived to tell the demonstrators the group was in violation of University policies and gave the protesters 10 minutes to leave. Police were met with aggression, and protesters swung objects at officers."

It's NOT journalism. UVAToday is UVA's news outlet, not an independent, objective news media site. The stories are essentially news releases, not news stories, and should be read as such.

People are tired of the bs

They must have been trained by the idf

They were asked to leave. They refused. Then the police removed them. What implications are on this title?

Thats not journalism, it’s simply the university propaganda machine doing its work.

This comment section is so cooked.

Question for high school graduating classes: do you want to go to a school that pulls this shit? Riot cops with big weapons? WTF. 1st Amendment doesn’t count for Palestinian interests?

Why is it only Iran and it’s proxies are supporting the Palestinians? Ask yourself that…why are the Egyptian, Jordanian, Saudi Arabian, Emeratii, and others in the region not supporting the Palestinian?

What’s despicable is privileged, entitled brats siding with terrorists. These people need to wake up. Hamas is no better than ISIS.

Can you please protest a violent genocide non-violently? Violence hurts our feelings unless it's violence against black and brown children.

Poor babies

Fuck'em expel them all.

👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 I say everyone who sided with them and didn’t leave when ordered gets expelled 🥹

*propaganda

Peaceful? Throwing hands with people you disagree with is considered “peaceful” nowadays? So, if I don’t like a supporter of so and so, I can just punch him in the jaw and claim it’s a constitutional protest?

Send the fuckers to gaza

Graduation is 1.5 weeks away. Clear this crap out before mom and dad show up to celebrate with Jr. and the family. Come on.

What? They weee informed on Friday that they were legally declared an unlawful assembly and they needed to disperse. They went from peaceful protests to breaking the law. The violence aside comment, this fact can’t be debated.

What’s the difference between UVA turds and the others across the nations? NOTHING!!!

Soros funded protesters got violent....who knew?

I hope graduation is cancelled

Throwing feces at law enforcement isn’t peaceful. I’m ashamed of UVA and before any of you nerds ask yes I was there

Awwww are you butt hurt because it makes my comments invalid in your none inclusive eyes?

Are the arrested students or ones involved getting University disciplinary action? Will they have to leave and no longer enroll at UVa?

Why are there people protesting this. The optics are terrible for these idiots… meanwhile Israel is watching college level narcissists rant and rave on a campus that smells like suburbia and thinks, yah know, that kid in the purple hair with a pronoun sign is right…. We must forget that they attacked and raped our women and bring peace to the Middle East as it has always been

Thank George Soros for paying people to protest. The protestors should be fined minimum $5000. each, double what Soros paid them.

You should sue them for libel or slander or something if the protestors actually did nothing . You probably have a law student friend that would know

Well, side with terrorists, you dig your own grave

Love it. Think it's accurate.

Protests after the Trumps good old boys will never be the same on UVA grounds. You can blame the torch boys for strick guideline’s. No tents meant No Tents. Poke the bear and It’s instantly GTFU. You all didn’t give two shits about any of this before it happen. Yes it all sucks but nothing you can do here will help. It’s not our country if you want something to get done beat the doors down over there 👉

Education first.

Fuck Palestine

Wake up and look what’s going on across the nation. It’s not met to be peaceful.

UVA has issue with Hamas

I’m asking why you think nations and groups that support terror are the only one to support Palestinians.

Obvious to me none of y'all know your history Palestinians Muslims the Muslim faith came after the Jewish faith and Muslims came from Abraham and Sarah's hand maiden they had an illegitimate child he was a boy in the Jewish faith the father always gives one of the sons The Blessing the Son that was born to Sarah's hand maiden didn't get the blessing If you understand Muslim faith in their book the Quran it states kill all infidels who are infidels anybody that's not Muslim Before you go protesting know your history and why you are protesting and come with consequences Israel just wants to be left alone but the radical Islamic people Hamas and other radical Muslims wants the Jews killed in anybody else that is not Muslim Food for thought

This is Pravda or Fox News level.

~~It is a student run organization. A press release would come from the office of the university's president.~~ Edit: Not my best day. Confused with another publication.

Reading the article it seems far less sudden. Tents and megaphones started being used, which goes against university policies. University police asked them to disassemble because of the breach of campus policies. Protesters reasonably refused because their demands where rejected by UVA. But this caused an escalation of events.

I hope people keep pressing them on that, can we get an answer as to what this alleged nondescript violence was? I'm pretty sure the armed men in camo holding rifles and hiding their faces caused a lot more fear and anxiety about violence occurring scared the student body a hell of a lot more than some scrawny 20 somethings sitting on some grass....

Not super well versed but when I read the headline it seems to imply it happened over a couple of days

Blaming the police breaking up a protest for students getting violent against police is the most smooth-brained take I’ve ever heard. You don’t get to fight the police.

Where does it say violence? The headline is failure to comply with disperse orders. Is that not true?

Has anyone seen any footage of the encounters between the protesters and the University (as opposed to the state and local) police? It might help clarify things…

Chapel area and encampment are completely surrounded by state police in tactical gear

Where was this in 2017?

Great way to escalate tensions

Insane. So unnecessary.

Surely there must be some irony in something like this happening at the university founded by Jefferson and where James Madison was significantly involved.

Apparently you're only allowed to protest in a manner that is acceptable to the forces you're protesting against. Heaven forbid your peaceful protest effect their sensibilities.

These limp dicked University presidents are folding to the fascist pigs.

No tiki torches when they're on duty.

Hopefully the massive endowment is paying for this overtime and not the commonwealth. And where was this massive presence in 2017?!? When actual antisemitic shit was going down. Stop actual crazy nazis? Negative. Stop protests against the military industrial complex? OMGz call up the National Guard!

So stupid - such a bad look

They love it because they’re getting paid overtime for this too.

Strong voices. Well done don’t get intimidated 🍉

You know what’s interesting to think about. They have, in the best instance, gotten 4 months of training. Just something to think about

Students have been protesting for most of this week. They were told days ago not to put up tents. They ignored that and put up tents yesterday night anyways. Students are allowed to protest, but when they start blatantly disregarding rules, that's when situations like UCLA happen. It's completely appropriate for the university to shut this down before it escalates further.

Yeah this is sad, but every minute the cops are forced to spend here is another minute 40% of them are not able to domestically abuse their family.

Not state police, badge looks like ACPD

Because terrorists insurrectionists have taken offer

They serious about His Lawn up there

They always have this dumbass face on.

"YOU'RE ARRESTING KIDS INSTEAD " Sheesh lol 😆 call themselves put huh?

Good. These protestors are not on the moral high ground. Bunch of cultists, think they are following their conscience when they know little of the situation or history. I support the police. These protests are being coordinated by outside agitators. It’s a bunch of misguided and misled weak Minded students who don’t deserve to be getting a superior education.

But yea let them Nazi’s march all over campus with fire hazard torches…

Well, yes—they’re police. They are an organized crime gang with absolutely no morals or standards.

lol at the rifle magazines (and not even carrying a rifle)

These enlightened students are such morons. Those police officers that they are yelling at are there to protect the campus and students. I guess they just need someone to yell at.

Cops should never look like soldiers. They are on a college campus not a battle field. When police look like they are in a war zone they start to act like they are in a war zone.

Why don’t these kids denounce their US citizenship, fly over and join the Palestinian army and take care of the problem they feel like they need to fight for?

I don't support the police actions at these protests, but I also don't support these protests. Every single party in this discussion seems to be fuckin insane. Pro-palestinian protestors are protesting for people who genuinely would kill most of the people protesting. The police and admin here seem to be hell bent on unproportional response. Hamas is a bunch of cowards who hide behind children. The IDF are just happily murdering thousands of civilians. Everyone sucks here.

I would wear tactical gear too if I was in front of a terorrist-sympathizing mob.

Sure, but those instances you mentioned also had intense reactions from the police/government. So the fact there is a lot of police shouldn’t be a shock

They are about to learn about America

Charge in, use pepper spray....lots of it

Guess the right to protest is a fallacy.

These children are too loud and hostile. They need to be warned by the police: "Red Alert, Red Alert. If you continue to conduct yourselves in a disrespectful manner, we will take you and spank your butts. We will turn those butts red. Your parents will be called to come and take you back home."

Npcs protestors

Cops support whatever Trump tells the Republican Party to do this week

They traded their khakis for camo

I thought these cops were the ones attending those rallies?

it's 110% inflammatory. They could easily have cops just on the far outside to keep the peace away from everyone peacefully protesting, most of this would fizzle out after a few hot/rainy days anyways but instead they are beating up students again and again.

A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.

What irony?

Actually, Jefferson was a big believer in the Rule of Law and personal accountability, so he'd understand. The irony would be in thinking there was irony as suggested.

They are spineless but who are the fascist pigs that you refer to?

UVA is honoring todays anniversary of the Kent State shootings on 5/4/1970. Just the wrong side.

Frat guys looking at the low COVID-19 numbers last semester

Yesterday I was speaking to a local 58 year business owner about this. I asked him what frat males really contribute to society. He happen to have participated in that area of paid friendship when he was in college as a member. He looked me directly in my inquisitive eyes and responded, "absolutely nothing."

not surprising that the reddit community didn't get a bid

The pay for friendship thing is so silly. The money gets spent for group events, things for the house, trips, etc. If anything, sororities is pay for friendship.

Then everybody clapped

False. I got a bid. From your mom (┌・。・)┌

Maybe people dislike the misbehavior of greek life for reasons *other* than they did not get a bit. Perhaps because it is a blatant disrespect to the community.

You made a reddit account to post this? LMFAO

Can confirm this is true. I was also applauding.

A message to all ENWR professors

Former grad student here, with bad news for you: the writing never gets better.

I too took ~~How to Confuse the Shit Out of People With Words 1010~~ any humanities class

They write to impress each other and don’t seem to care if their papers are even somewhat accessible to the general public. A layperson who wants to read an academic paper has to pay for it and hope he/she could understand it. Colleges like to see themselves as the great equalizers but in fact are part of the establishment.

fav post so far

\*poorly written.

Sometimes college students need to learn to read differently.

I’m a third year English major, every single one of my classes is an overcomplicated book club.

Excel and papers so dense and dry they may as well have been made with saltines made from concrete are the two unavoidable aspects of graduate study

I couldn’t agree more.

Biden has won

Is anyone streaking yet?

I wonder how the corner guy is doing

Meanwhile fucking Nevada ballot counters still hitting the casinos rather than getting the results out in a timely fashion lmao

OH MY FUCKING GOD AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH 🥳

they told me to back the blue so i voted blue 😌

Stay safe. Wear a mask. Wash your hands. Don't touch your face. Avoid large groups. Fuck Trump. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TE5fmZrqtL8

Covid cases gonna skyrocket around here in the next couple weeks

Where’s the rioting and looting that was supposed to happen when the Trump supporters lost? Oh wait, it’s not going to happen. Businesses were being boarded up in case he won.

Doesn't seem like the sub for this news, but ok.

Unfortunately

Lol at people downvoting me because my evidence of electoral fraud is beyond reproach!

Fraud election

https://github.com/cjph8914/2020_benfords This is analysis that shows solid evidence of ballot count tampering in Illinois and Wisconsin. https://ibb.co/q9vv4Xc This image shows a set of bellwether counties that have historically predicted election outcomes. Trump wins every single one except for one. The chance that this happens and he loses without systemic bias (i.e. fraud) is astronomically low.

people are going to tonight lol

Does it count if you are wearing a mask? I'm not trying to contract covid while celebrating fam.

You didn't hear it from me but they're opening ballots one by one on the casino floors, betting if it's D or R. Of course, the house takes the win if it's an independent vote. /s

I mean most of us are literally going to be gone in like 2 weeks so..

this aged well

That's presuming bellwethers are absolute. They aren't, they just have a history of being correlative.

And I will be with them

Imma say it counts. I’m sure TJ can make an exception here

me too! but probably in the wee hours of the morning

Stolen from twitter

Is there an outbreak currently happening in one of the dorms?

There have been herds of students hanging out in that area and walking around in small groups with flagrant disregard for mask usage

Balz-dobie Edit: can't spell

https://returntogrounds.virginia.edu/updates/statement-regarding-covid-testing-balz-dobie-residence-hall

Where? I live in balz dobie and I have never seen groups of students without masks anywhere near there.

Every time I've gone past the field next to O-hill it's been swarmed with students, only about 30% of which are actively wearing masks

the myth of "consensual" covid safety

This is gonna make all the right people big mad, nice work.

The thing is, uva doesn’t actually consent themselves 🤪🤪 we should really be critiquing the institutions that allow this more than the individuals

I think you fail to realize they still do not care

Are you referring to "the right" politically? If so, I think it's a bit naive to assume someone does not practice social distancing simply because they fall within a certain portion of the political spectrum.

It’s upsetting to think about the fact UVA prioritized donor money from frats more than their students safety and holds everyone but themselves accountable

Students! Tell on each other!!!!! Students! Get suspended!!! But very few actually productive preventative measures that prioritize student safety as they claim to

I agree but I think the universities response seems to focus the blame on the organizations. I like to think of it as a parent child relationship. If the parent doesn’t stop the child from doing something that They know they are going to do and instead encourages it, who’s responsibility was it in the first place ? ( I mean both for sure but just making a point)

I said they are both to blame, one of them could’ve also prevented it knowing the other would act in ignorance

Letters from DOJ reveal threats to U.Va. over admissions policies, Ryan’s leadership

Justice department doesn’t know the meaning of the word “penultimate” 🙄

Such a shame. Irrespective if Jim Ryan would have resigned, I expect UVa could have assembled a sufficiently capable legal team and successfully challenged these specious accusations from DOJ if the BOV had the best interests of the university as its highest priority.

> The Justice Department claimed it had received another complaint from an active undergraduate student at the University about race-based admissions to the McIntire School of Commerce. Which butthurt Comm school wiener wrote the letter? Show your face. Lmao.

I hope that the fine purveyors and business owners in this city make Charlottesville an unpleasant place to visit for Harmeet Dhillon when she inevitably comes back to visit their alma mater to survey all that she has destroyed.

Can someone explain what exactly they are accusing the University of doing?

Did Barron not get in to UVA?

They thought it meant "final written warning". Why else would it start with "pen"?

This is amazing.

If adhering to the laws of the nation is the second to last duty of public officials, I wonder what the last one is.

University of Virginia unlike Harvard has to rely on the lawyers who were hired by the Republican attorney General after he fired the lawyers at George Mason and UVA. Only other recourse would have been to rely on the state MAGA attorney general. Harvard, as a well endowed private university, can hire whatever lawyers they want and they can rely on their two boards to support and advise them. University of Virginia gets to rely on a board of visitors made up of political appointees by a conservative Republican governor, and Republican lawyers appointed by our republican attorney general.

>The DOJ has apparently decided to take a harder line than anticipated Or they're doing exactly what they planned to do, leaving it intentionally ambiguous and seizing the opportunity to go after good faith attempts by schools at following the law. Basically entrapping schools like UVA. Fascists never act in good faith. Ever.

The DOJ taking a hard line would be them bringing evidence to a federal court. This is the DOJ manufacturing FUD and using extortion to take down a university president.

So no genetic testing? People can identify as anything they want!

I feel like the massive student protests will pretty much ruin her experience anyway.

Being rude and uncivil and petulant accomplishes what, exactly?

No one can, that's the point.

Troll account. Block and move on, people.

Agree completely which is why I contend that the BOV was complicit in all of this to replace Ryan with a president who would implement Trump-MAGA directives

It discourages people from doing the things that lead others to be rude and uncivil to them.

It got Harmeet what she wanted.

crochet rotunda?

You should share this at r/crochet if you haven't already!! Did you freehand? Or is there a pattern?

Dang that’s really good. That must’ve taken so long

That is sick.

Girl I wanna buy one for my hoo boyfriend

Well done!!! 💙⚔️🧡

I was impressed and then I saw the banana! This thing is huge, well done

Are these the [official colors](https://brand.virginia.edu/brand-essentials/colors)? 😂 Amazing work!

i have (but thanks for looking out :) ) I “technically” freehanded but i used stitchfix to make the graph and used c2c to follow it!!

i started after christmas and thank you!!

thanks!! (im a hokie so it took a lot :,) )

making this took an 8 hour road trip, at least 20 movies, a whole season of bridgerton, all of wandavisok, and at least half the the episodes of shameless on netflix 😳

i did my best but if you look realllyyy closely under the second small column from the right i used a darker color (which was a mistake) but i take it as my way of rebelling

i used H/8-5.00mm and red heart brand (can find at walmart) in the lighter blue color and the (only) orange

Very cool! I'm itching to do a big project like this! You got the colors perfect BTW!

God damn, I understand. Good work though it’s amazing!!

Alright you drive a hard bargain. I’ll get you a fresh banana and three crisp $20s

thank red heart :))

promise not to say “fuck tech” in the good old song and we have a deal 😌

awww im so glad :))

The Corner on any given Friday at 11pm

I call shenanigans! Where are the pink/salmon shorts?

Wrong new balances and no one wears black socks out, geed

I second the rainbows, also need some Vineyard Vines/RL/JCrew

No rainbows? I do have those shirts and shorts tho

You need the backwards cap in there to

This has changed very little since 1989.

If you wear black nike socks you gotta stop Add pastel shorts

It's only killshots these days

National Championship T-shirt is a big difference

Seriously. Even some 574, 997 action to spice it up. OP def wears Allbirds to “stand out” and “support up and coming entrepreneurs”

Haha aww, they're just [shoes made by Nike ](https://www.shopwss.com/product/Killshot-2-Leather-Mens/432997107?gclid=CjwKCAjw29vsBRAuEiwA9s-0B3gjB_2WKZXCvP5rItZBXdjOoRCaTSxdp9-uwQqQDGc53CYRMHdtOBoC6WEQAvD_BwE) Man hearing that makes me sad I'll be gone in a year

Class of 04 woo!

A peaceful moment on grounds on the first day of classes

I can taste the virtual dumplings

Is the halal truck doing ok?

I want those dumplings so bad, I didn’t realize before I was having my last one!

I am new, where do I need to go to get dumplings?

Well now I'm real life sad.

I didn’t see any food trucks. Where does the halal truck usual park? I can look for it.

I had my last dumplings the last day of in person classes in March. Was joking about how many plus dollars I needed to spend after spring break at the dumpling truck.

I doubt we have food trucks without in person classes but pretty sure the dumpling truck was an offshoot of got dumplings on the corner? I'm a second year and ashamed to admit i never went first year so someone correct me if im wrong

There used to be food trucks parked right where the picture was taken, but I guess they're gone for COVID reasons. I'm pretty sure Got Dumplings on the Corner was the one running the truck, but even if it wasn't it tastes exactly the same (superrr good I definitely recommend)

Got Dumplings (on the corner) normally place a truck in that location where students could use plus dollars to buy dumplings + sides. I highly recommend you try them on the corner

Marco & Luca’s, near Take It Away. Also, go to Take It Away.

It’s usually right about where that picture was taken :(

I will try for sure!

Absolutely! I need to eat extra dumplings to honor all the people on this sub who are too far away to get them.

Dammit, now I am hungry. Will check these out!

WE'RE IN THE FINALS. WAHOOOOWAAAAA

Auburn is going to be salty until the end of time but it was 100% the right call

Can’t believe it wtfffff

As a Bama fan from Auburn, thank you so much lol

Let’s buy him a 100 toasters

Monday: best place to watch the game? GO.

I can't believe that we actually made it. I am diehard UVA hoops fan and I am still in awe of how far we have come.Reddit co-founder Alexis (u/kn0thing ) was in my graduating class at UVA in 05. We didn't make the tournament in any of my 4 years of college. JPJ finally opened in 2006, and in 2007 we made the tournament for the first time since 2001. We lost in the second round to Bruce Pearl's Tennessee team. Now we are one win away from our first national championship. &#x200B; &#x200B;

Hooooooooooooooos!

Let's fucking gooooo!!!!!

DRAGON ENERGY

<3 I don't have time hate you till next season. Let's do this for the Commonwealth.

wouldnt really say it was well deserved after that double dribble call, kinda feel bad for Auburn lol

No, it wasn't. Double dribbling is illegal. I'm not an Auburn or Virginia fan, and that was horrible.

Haha didn’t you guys just fire your coach?

I watched at Kickback Jack's in southside Richmond. Place was electric and they understood I was going to be there long after I was done with my meal lol. Hearing a place full of people shouting 'U V A! U V A!" made it so worth going.

They're airing it at JPJ

They're showing it at the Paramount for free but you do have to pre-register

Watch it again. Ty was fouled.

They were terrible and let us cut their lead. In the end they ended up coming back but if your trash most of the game do you deserve to win?

it was a foul before the double dribble ya cunt

I was referring to the foul on the 3 pointer. TBH the double dribble was a missed call, but if you watch the whole game in slow motion you'll see a bunch just like it for either side. Nobody on the court noticed it at the time - refs, commentators, Auburn players.

Yes lol. Just waiting on football season

Yeah doors open at 8

Oh no lol I’m a Virginia fan I’m just saying that it’s kind of a shame they missed the call in real time and how everyone suddenly becomes knowledgeable about what a double dribble is after having to see that replay in slow motion

When Groves tells you to take a walk for fun...

Perhaps a bit harsh, but its hard to appreciate being told to enjoy your 800th hike in the last 6 months.

Dean Groves is not a treasure, he’s a clown

No. I actually know him outside of UVA and he is a truly terrible person. You have no idea what this man is capable of.

Anyone who got surrounded by a mob of white supremacists while standing arm in arm with students while his partner gets hit by a thrown tiki torch is a treasure in my book. He’s doing his best given the situation

Maybe things have changed since I graduated, but Dean Groves was, in my experience, an incredible administrator and really cared about the students.

Actually, he was the one hit by a torch when he went into the mob to get the students out of harm. Good man.

Yes, white supremacists are despicable people. That has absolutely nothing to do with uva admin fucking over their student body.

Yep, it’s getting absolutely ridiculous at this point. Uva should not have this level of control over my life, especially since I never enter an on grounds building. They can smile and put their spin on it, but it’s complete bullshit.

College age students? I think your info is a little off. Cal PA had a football player die in August. Penn State had one in July.

Not sure he’s making the decisions here. I suspect not.

Are their policies really that much worse than others? Legitimately asking because I’m unaware of how it stacks against the majority.

What kitchens did they close?

Oh yeah. Other schools aren’t imposing ridiculous restrictions for off campus students. There’s a huge difference between punishing students for massive parties and prohibiting students from gathering in a group of 6.

That’s insane. I bet they didn’t refund anything despite you not being able to use a critical part of your housing.

Please stop recording people without their consent Hey guys, I know in our generation this sort of stuff is normalized, but it’s getting to be a bit much. Obviously taking pics of yourself at the lawn and people being in the background is different - but can we stop taking videos and pictures of people even if we think it’s cool/interesting/funny and want to put it on social media without the persons consent?? I’ve been noticing this lately with the beautiful weather. A lot of people were taking close up photos and videos of some older ladies painting the rotunda just today, and no one even asked them if it was okay to do so. The women clearly were unaware that they were being recorded for people’s Instagram stories. I know some people don’t mind and it’s been absolutely gorgeous - who doesn’t wanna take a picture of our grounds? But close ups and videos of individual people is just … a lot.

Basically you’re asking your fellow students to be considerate and respectful even though it’s legal. I can understand, I too do not want to be photographed like a zoo animal. Unless it’s Nat Geo, they can get the angles right when I eat a first year.

[Were you watching a video shoot organized by the Alumni Association?](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DHa-i5avV1z/?igsh=MTNqbDkxMmkyOGJwOA==)

Social media, man. people don't really care if they can get that viral moment I saw these leaked photos of Kendrick Lamar at a UCLA class. Yes he’s famous but can’t he just learn in peace? Not everything needs to be a social media moment

Let me put this in perspective for some of you. Do you want to be some rando's jack-off material? Or with AI do you want them to use your image for AI generated pornography? It's just rude to randomly film or photograph someone in general especially since who know what will happen with that footage. Some of ya'll are TRYING to make people agoraphobic and it's cruel and selfish.

If you are outside, you are at risk of photos being taken. But it should be common courtesy to not make strangers the subject of your photos. And posting such photos online is pretty gross.

If you don't think it's right, ask them to stop. Out loud, using your words. Posting here is pointless.

Check UVA’s insta story …

I agree 💯 with you should be only with people consent

Update: it looks like the women knew they were being recorded. It's on the official UVA Instagram story lol

If you're in public, just assume you're on video from somewhere. security cameras, doorbell cameras, traffic cameras, google maps can practically count your nose hairs from space at this point. Parents used to tell their kids "be on your best behavior, remember jesus is watching" well now jesus is just the obscene amount of technology permeating all aspects of life. too late to unscramble that egg man

Is it public property?

Now the university cares 🤣😁🤣 , so phony

No expectation of privacy in a public place.

Privacy is an illusion . . . cameras mounted on roadways, public places, governmental buildings, businesses, inside and outside of residences, car dash cams, and computers . . . if one allows their cell phone access to the camera and other settings, one has allowed their privacy to be invaded. If is disingenious to be upset that people surreptitiously or overtly photograph, audiorecord, or videorecord activities outside of places the courts have deemed a place where one should feel secure in their right to privacy. The Patriot Act overrode U.S. citizens rights to privacy; those who desired security at such a high price should not be having buyer's remorse at the outcome.

It's a first amendment right. There is no expected privacy in public.

If you are in public, you are being recorded. If you think older women aren't acutely aware of this fact you are misled. It seems you were concerned on behalf of someone else, who wasn't concerned. If someone recording you makes you uncomfortable, you should ask them to stop. Outside of that, I'm not sure what you want.

Touch grass Jesus Christ lmao

Why would consent be needed in a public area? I can record whatever the f I want.

Hi Dean J! I got into UVA as an international student from India in RD. Will I receive an admission package? can I track it somehow?

Let me break it down for you zealot... Photography is a protected RIGHT in the constitution. PERIOD. DO NOT PASS GO, DO NOT COLLECT $200... You're lack of understanding protected inalienable rights EVERY American citizen has. So yes your post is ignorance.

I think this is the big thing, some people have been confronted about their actions a grand total 0 times... One confrontation might actually change something For some reason it's big in the US to be anti-confrontational socially and not step on people's toe but if you want something to change you're not doing enough if you haven't tried using your words in real life

Can't get hundreds of upvotes if you don't performatively complain.

I mean true, but comments like this weird me out. Can’t people also vent a little?

Saying fuck you is legal but that doesn’t mean you should say fuck you to strangers without being provoked

Just because it’s legal does not mean it should be normalized to record individuals and post it to social media without their consent or knowledge. If you insist on doing this to others, then you are weird as hell. Edit: I feel like I clarified my point in the original post. There is a large moral difference between taking a picture of yourself at the rotunda and there are passerby’s in the background versus targeting a specific person or persons to record, even if in public, when they either don’t consent or have no knowledge of said act.

Just because something is legal doesn’t mean you should do it and doesn’t mean it’s morally right.

It legitimately must be so easy being you. Can't imagine how stress-free it would be to have such a simple understanding of the world

Found one of those. And surprised to see people even upvoting this.

I seriously doubt most college students today voted for the Patriot Act. Like, most of them were probably not in Congress in 2001 and had the opportunity to vote for it. Besides, this person isn’t talking about rights. They’re not talking about the legality of photographing people without asking. They’re talking about politeness. Nobody is required by law to be polite. It just sure would be nice, is all they are saying. In any event, it looks like there was a video being shot for the Alumni Association, but the point is still valid.

Way to grasp the point, Cletus McIncel.

While UVA is a "Public" University, there do have regulations and policies as it pertains to commercial filming on UVA Property and in UVA facilities. If someone is shooting video/audio for social media monitory gain, it is considered commercial filming. You are required to get permission to film on University Property for commercial purposes. Otherwise, yes. No privacy is expected in public.

Exactly. People are recorded 24/7 by security ect but have a problem with some rando with a phone.

You sound like a total weirdo. People dont want to be recorded by random people as soon as they leave the house and that's not some "technological inevitability", its morons not having basic respect for other people in public.

Nobody else does this...why did you need to start doing it?

1st amendment covers freedom of the press. This does not mean your Instagram, Facebook, only fans, ect. It does not mean you can exploit others for your gain.

I’ve dealt with a pretty benign version of this where people would “””sneakily”””” take photos my dog… I tell them they can just ask and pet him People don’t really want to be confrontational especially post COVID

Unless they're cops. Fuck the pigs

No expectation of privacy in a PUBLIC SPACE.... Read the f.'n Constitution.

Just because you make a reddit post to complain, doesn't mean it will stop. In fact, it will not stop... So, what's your next course of action?

Morality is subjective... Try again. Leave your religion out of it "morality".

This persons opinion is garbage and it’s a pretty bold move either way with their post history. Wondering why they care so much about recording people in public.

Point is your morals do not suspend their rights

Policy and regulations do not supercede law and constitution

Monetary* Stay in school kids. And feel free to record people while you’re there.

What do you suggest to be done? Laws making it illegal? Unless you have a suggestion, you aren't contributing anything. People in public have a right to record other people in public and there are good reasons for that. People have a right to be disrespectful.

No, people do this. Then when the landlord says rent didnt come you have a video of you paying it. Its smart when you have a shitty landlord

UVA student club endorses murders in Israel, says they are "a step towards a free Palestine". I have no words... &#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/55wc1srx6htb1.png?width=1222&format=png&auto=webp&s=dfcb86a4524a82ea5a9142f8dcceba3c09c3ab6c

I don’t understand how people can see Hamas attacking and killing hundreds of civilians as anything but terrorism. They say that events over the last two days make them hopeful for the future of Palestine, but this will only cause more death to Israelis and Palestinians.

It's a bad statement, and ought to be roundly condemned. At the same time, it's a waste to actually give these sorts of folks oxygen. Take note of the folks who made it, and move on.

This is a bunch of sheltered college kids living in a bubble of nothing but people who already agree with their worldview. Their statement is bullshit on its own merits, made much worse by their misguided certainty that they are absolutely and unquestionably righteous.

They turned the comments off on their Instagram

Murdering Israelis doesn't = a "free Palestine." HAMAS, the terrorist organization is who's causing such atrocities to happen. Hamas is killing their own people and using them as human shields.

Is there anything in the CIO policies about supporting a terrorist organization?

I feel very sorry for my Jewish friends at UVA who are surely worried about their peers who so gleefully support these groups advocating for the elimination of all Jews. I used to have a difficult time understanding how the holocaust happened, but I see far too many otherwise liberal people that are perfectly willing to support this murderous ideology. I truly am sorry that my children are having to witness this.

Interesting; when I was at UVA the club was called Students for *Peace* and Justice in Palestine. Apparently they dropped the word “peace”.

I agree with your sentiment. I found what the SJP said to be roundly unhinged. Even Harvard’s letter (which was in itself very unreasonable) was mild compared to this. Shame on SJP.

Celebrating the death and brutalization of the civilians is a cowardly act. Israel's enemies can't win a fight between combatants alone. That's why he they hid among the populace. For 75 years the Palestinians and Arab nations have been on the losing side. Israel has tried to have peace but the Palestinian puppet masters don't want a better future for the people. Israel is not going anywhere. There will be more senseless death and destruction. Israel will rebuild and the Palestinians will only have their sorrow and tears.

Look through the comments if you truly want to be disgusted Edit: of the Instagram post. @sjpuva

New idea: Don't try to justify the intentional targeting and killing of civilians.

Absolutely disgusting. If any other group were raped, abused, beheaded, and killed the world would shower them with support. But because this happened to Israelis, the world has either gone silent or BLAMED them for getting attacked? It's absurd, heartbreaking, and downright evil.

Expell every signatory immediately.

This is even worse than Harvard’s. Need the list of these students publicized so companies don’t have to hire them like Bill Ackman stated. The letter is dangerously ignorant and leaves out the numerous times Palestinians/Arabs either declared war instead of peaceful coexistence (1948, 1967, 1973) or spurned legitimate two state solutions in the 90s and 00s. One side only wants peace if it means Israel is no longer a thing; the other side has tried to compromise.

Where’s your pearl clutching when Israel just bombed a hospital? Or how about the young Palestinian boy that was stabbed to death here in the states because of Islamophobia on the rise

The only thing this does is give Isreali far right nationalists ammunition to fire bomb all of gaza

This is from 2014 but still has relevance. “I don’t think Israel should exist as a Jewish state. I think it is obscene, irrational and unjustifiable to have a state organized around a religion. So I don’t celebrate the idea that there’s a Jewish homeland in the Middle East. I certainly don’t support any Jewish claims to real estate based on the Bible… but the truth is that there is an obvious, undeniable, and hugely consequential moral difference between Israel and her enemies. The Israelis are surrounded by people who have explicitly genocidal intentions towards them. The charter of Hamas is explicitly genocidal. It looks forward to a time, based on Koranic prophesy, when the earth itself will cry out for Jewish blood, where the trees and the stones will say “O Muslim, there’s a Jew hiding behind me. Come and kill him.” This is a political document. We are talking about a government that was voted into power by a majority of Palestinians. The discourse in the Muslim world about Jews is utterly shocking. Not only is there widespread Holocaust denial—there’s Holocaust denial that then asserts that we will do it for real if given the chance. The only thing more obnoxious than denying the Holocaust is to say that it should have happened; it didn’t happen, but if we get the chance, we will accomplish it. There are children’s shows in the Palestinian territories and elsewhere that teach five-year-olds about the glories of martyrdom and about the necessity of killing Jews. And this gets to the heart of the moral difference between Israel and her enemies. And this is something I discussed in The End of Faith. To see this moral difference, you have to ask what each side would do if they had the power to do it. What would the Jews do to the Palestinians if they could do anything they wanted? Well, we know the answer to that question, because they can do more or less anything they want. The Israeli army could kill everyone in Gaza tomorrow. So what does that mean? Well, it means that, when they drop a bomb on a beach and kill four Palestinian children, as happened last week, this is almost certainly an accident. They’re not targeting children. They could target as many children as they want. Every time a Palestinian child dies, Israel edges ever closer to becoming an international pariah. So the Israelis take great pains not to kill children and other noncombatants. What do we know of the Palestinians? What would the Palestinians do to the Jews in Israel if the power imbalance were reversed? Well, they have told us what they would do. For some reason, Israel’s critics just don’t want to believe the worst about a group like Hamas, even when it declares the worst of itself. We’ve already had a Holocaust and several other genocides in the 20th century. People are capable of committing genocide. When they tell us they intend to commit genocide, we should listen. There is every reason to believe that the Palestinians would kill all the Jews in Israel if they could. Would every Palestinian support genocide? Of course not. But vast numbers of them—and of Muslims throughout the world—would. Needless to say, the Palestinians in general, not just Hamas, have a history of targeting innocent noncombatants in the most shocking ways possible. They’ve blown themselves up on buses and in restaurants. They’ve massacred teenagers. They’ve murdered Olympic athletes. They now shoot rockets indiscriminately into civilian areas. And again, the charter of their government in Gaza explicitly tells us that they want to annihilate the Jews—not just in Israel but everywhere." https://www.samharris.org/podcasts/making-sense-episodes/why-dont-i-criticize-israel

Today, October 11, international press and Israeli soldiers validated that over 40 babies were murdered in their beds. Hamas was not satisfied with mere genocide. They also beheaded the babies and left their bodies strewn on the ground. Perhaps the "Students for Justice in Palestine at UVA" could explain how this barbaric behavior is remotely defensible. Over 1,000 innocent Israeli citizens were murdered. Young women were raped and tortured. Elderly, defenseless men and women were murdered and kidnapped. Palestinian citizens in Gaza chortled and further desecrated their dead bodies that were transported in open trucks driven by exultant Hamas butchers on the Palestinian streets of the Gaza Strip. The idea of a separate Palestinian state is over. These acts unequivocally prove the Palestinian visceral hatred of Israel and Jews is not only implacable, it is antithetical to basic norms of humanity. Israel needs to eradicate Hamas, then put any complicit Palestinian citizens extolling or abetting Hamas' genocide in jail for life or on trial for murder, sentencing them to the death penalty. They have abrogated their right to further life on this earth. Let St. Peter deal with them, and they better pray that Allah has some sway with him. I doubt he does. Do the Students for Justice in Palestine at UVA have a problem with my post? Tough. Deal with it. The world of rational, ethical human beings and I are right. You are dead wrong.

u/DoctorJonZoidberg responded to me then immediately blocked me so I’m posting my reply to his comment here Lol love that you’re digging into my profile. Completely ignoring the rudeness and indecency of the person I was arguing with. And overlooking the polite and source backed debates I had with others. Surprise surprise Palestinians are humans too, and have limited patience with all the false accusation’s we’re sifting through. The quote from the journalist you placed here does not prove infant beheadings or rape. I’m not denying civilians are being massacred so not sure what you’re trying to prove there. The IDF has said there’s no evidence to substantiate this yet and no credible news source has reported it, but if you want to go with TMZ and Daily Mail that’s your call. As for the partition plans, yeah that’s not how that works. You have to look at historical context. The Palestinians and Arabs were living there and were promised by the British Arab sovereignty in the region in exchange for revolting against the Ottomans, they also populated to and tended most of the land there. Mass Jewish immigration follows this but Jews remain a minority only owning 3-4% of the land. The British have now gone back on their promise and are promising Jewish immigrants a state and suddenly giving large percentages of land to them that they’re not entitled to, yeah obviously they’re going to reject it. As for the famous partition plan in 1947, which bumped that number up to 55% despite there being twice as many Arabs in the entire country and Jews only owning 5% of the land, I mean yeah why wouldn’t they be taking these deals. Many members of the Zionist congress also made their reason for accepting these partitions that they were good starting points to taking the rest of the land.

Tell me your alternative. You've, assumedly, the benefit of a quality university education here at UVA, so in comparison to those who've been living under active seige in an open-air prison for the past few decades, it should be no challenge. What should the people do? What should the few thousand children killed by Israeli forces have done? What should the victims of internationally banned chemical weapons attacks, implemented by Israel, have done? They can't exactly Call Saul, here, since Israel refused to be a signatory on the ICC charter--as if that would do anything, anyway. What different should the uncountable dead have done? Vote? It's easy to sit back in our comfortable armchairs in the imperial core and look at the world and judge it, in the same way it's easy for me to yell at football players on a Sunday afternoon. It's trivial to reckon with effects. The alternative--reckoning with causes--is either too scary for you to do, or too difficult. Pick one.

Is this an actual student group? Does anyone know anyone in it?

There is certainly an angle for support of innocent PALESTINIAN PEOPLE, who are caught in the crossfire of an infinitely complex conflict. However to say all of these events and actions are anything but the deepest form of malevolence is just obsencely ignorant; this post putting that ignorance on full display. I have a middle eastern studies degree and would love to discuss this topic with anyone who would like to learn more.

Just wait till israel responds and have all of them cry throwing stupid buzzwords with no real meaning like apartheid, war crimes, etc at absolutely everything israel does. Terrorists, they should be sent to palestine

I don’t know much about the conflict but decolonization is violent and from the sounds of the Palestinians Israel has been the bully for almost a whole century

UVA= terrorist sympathizers by openly supporting hamas.

If you look at SJP’s ins account, most of their followers are of a certain demographics. What do you expect?

This is what happens when the US took in so many of Arab people as refugees out of generosity. This is when we literally deport thousands of people a year from Honduras/Cuba, who will suffer violence when they go home. It’s in everyone’s best interest to not take in any refugees from Gaza and give the quota to Latin American refugees

[ Removed by Reddit ]

Inform campus police immediately

Who are SJP? Is it a few students or many? Palestinian, muslim, white progressives? Is endorsing terrorism grounds for revoking a student visa?

It is important to separate people like this who support hamas and those who support a free palestine and an end to military occupation.

they will excuse any of their actions because they’re an oppressed minority, which in their mind automatically makes them morally higher. i’m all for campaigning for freedom and peace, hell you can use military force if need be. but you don’t do it by attacking civilians in bomb shelters, gunning down festival goers, and spitting on the bodies of dead and likely raped women. Hamas has likely brought destruction on all of Palestine and have no one to blame but themselves.

I don't agree with what Hamas is doing but... it's really not that hard to understand. Back around the end of World War 1, the Palestinians pretty much lived in the area we now call Israel and they were under British colonial rule. People who would think of modern Palestinians as "their people" had been living in that same area for roundabouts 1000 years. After World War 2, a Jewish homeland was just up-and-created in that region and the people who'd been living there basically for 1000 years were told to get stuffed. They moved (or were moved) off their land so the Jews could have a homeland. Since then the borders of Israel have continuously expanded and the people who lived in that place have become second-class citizens if not outright prisoners in their ancestral home. None of that is to diminish what happened to the Jews in the Holocaust. I'm just recognizing that Israel wasn't created out of a tractless desert. People lived there and they were forced from their homes. Now, if you or I were marched out of our home at gunpoint we'd probably be pretty pissed off about it, right? We'd say we have a right to defend our homes. We'd fight back, right? Except the Palestinians are just WILDLY outclassed by the Israeli military. Like, it's not even funny. In terms of a symmetric, conventional conflict, Hamas represents about as much of a threat to the Israeli military as the Girl Scouts do. So, now here's the question: **GIVEN THAT** should the Palestinians just give up and flee their homes? Should they just abandon the land their ancestors have tended for 1000 years, uproot their lives, and go... where? Where even _can_ they go? Who will take them and what future can they possibly have? And if they don't do that, and they can't fight the Israeli military what is left to them but terrorism? We can say "this will only cause more deaths to Palestinians" but that's not true because, from their point of view, they're already dead if they don't fight back. And in that situation, if the only way you can effectively hurt your enemy is to hurt his civilian population... that's what you do. And let's not pretend that our history much better. Americans were all too happy to engage in brutal terror bombing campaigns when it was too costly to put our infantry into harms way. We were happy to exterminate our Native American populations like vermin when they stood in the way of Westward Expansion. And we were happy to torture the hell out of people when we thought it might give us an edge in the War on Terror. What's happening to civilians in Israel and Gaza is a tragedy, but it's going to KEEP HAPPENING until either every man, woman, and child in Gaza and the West Bank is dead or we're going to have to find a two-state solution that actually protects the territorial integrity of Gaza and the West Bank. And we can say "but they're bloodthirsty terrorists and they don't deserve that" but do they deserve to be exterminated? Because that's where we are.

the IDF has killed far more innocent civilians than hamas https://www.statista.com/chart/16516/israeli-palestinian-casualties-by-in-gaza-and-the-west-bank/

seeing thousands of children killed does that to some people

Literally the difference between a terrorist and a freedom fighter is who is being targeted. Of course there will be civilian casualties but sanctioned targeting of civilians is plain old terrorism.

Hama is not a government. It is not trying to negotiate for a Palestinian homeland. It is hated by many Palestinians. It is a terrorist group. But keeping with Netanyahu's character, they are responding with military action that is an over the top. That will only enrage Palestinians and lesson the empathy that the world has after the massacre.

No, if these people aren’t confronted then they will think their ideas are accepted and continue to push their hate

Here, here.

Dead Kennedys literally wrote "Holiday in Cambodia" about these people.

Similar to a student a few days ago calling everybody in a city hall meeting racist for thinking that having a homeless encampment on the downtown mall was a bad idea

When you post something that prompts a response that requires comments to be disabled, there is possibly an issue with the post

Agree. Hamas is a jihadist terror group, they would kill all the jews in Israel and then kill the jewish Palestinians once they’re done.

Got any sympathy for the scores of dead Palestinians?

god you sound insufferable

Seeing ordinary Palestinians cheering and dancing in the streets like clowns and handing out sweets in celebration lost them a lot of sympathy. The line between Hamas terrorist and innocent Palestinian is a blurry one.

I think there’s an element of caution in some cases because they don’t want to make themselves a target (Charlie Hebdo). These savages are living among us in every country in the west. There are terrorist sympathisers celebrating in our major cities, waving Nazi flags and calling for the destruction of not only Israel but all Jews. It must be very frightening for our peaceful Jewish communities. Hate, murder and violence is all these other clowns know.

Plaque placed in Alderman Library to recognize the birthplace of Reddit

The absolute business right there. Wahoowa! &#x200B; Now if we could get Serena in a UVA color inspired tennis outfit...

In recent years, Reddit’s array of chats also have been a free teaching aid for companies like Google, OpenAI and Microsoft. Those companies are using Reddit’s conversations in the development of giant artificial intelligence systems that many in Silicon Valley think are on their way to becoming the tech industry’s next big thing.

I made a post a couple months back about how /u/kn0thing founded reddit in that specific spot, and I studied there for motivation. I’d like to think I had some leg in this process?

> Now if we could get Serena in a UVA color inspired tennis outfit... Got their kid in full UVA gear around the time of the natty, close enough! https://twitter.com/alexisohanian/status/1115188751578406913

I believe he's said that he registered the domain in Alderman.

Hey /u/kn0thing where was the *real* birthplace of reddit?

I love that waffle house, absolute unit

They were in Boston when they came up with it though

I'm thinking squatting in the Comm school at night when it was in Monroe.

A child isn't born where it's conceived either.

And like I said conceiving is not same a birth. Did they register the site in alderman library? I consider that the birth of the site not the idea.

As far as I know, they registered while in Boston. But I may be wrong about that, I'm not trying to tell you you're wrong. Edit: I keep saying Boston but I actually meant Cambridge.

[So this](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bu6soadlm8u/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=irw61wnp8rqj) is directly from Alexis's Instagram. Edit: so if we are being semantic niether of us is right becuase the percurssor site was registered there. Also sounds like he considers it the birthplace of reddit so I'm going with it.

I decompiled the Wahoo Eats app, and it's SO much worse than we all thought Explanation in the comments because the post keeps tripping Reddit's spam filters (and if it STILL doesn't go through, then I'll just look like a lunatic.)

Consider this somewhat of a PSA when using the Wahoo Eats app, as beyond its jank and performance, I got curious a couple days ago and decompiled an apk of the app. Security-wise...hoo boy, where do I even begin? TL;DR (for students): \- The app allows unencrypted (HTTP) traffic, meaning your login data, payment info, and other personal data could be intercepted, viewed, saved, stolen, etc. on a public Wi-Fi network (Edit for clarity: if you use it on eduroam you should(?) be somewhat okay because it's a private network and uses modern encryption in its validation, but all it takes is one person on their off-grounds house wifi to crumble this house of cards.) \- It uses custom deep links that are hijackable — another app on your phone could trick Wahoo Eats into handing over sensitive data. \- It stores and exposes various IDs, API keys, and session data that should never be client-side. \- Payment modules are built on fragile, copy-pasted validation code and pass session keys around in ways that are insecure. ...All this in an app students are forced to use for dining with no alternative. Important disclaimers: \- This was done only by decompiling the Android APK (publicly downloadable from the Play Store). \- I didn’t touch any backend servers, databases, or live systems. This is client-side only. \- I’m one person with some help from agent-assisted tooling and just one evening of investigation, so while the findings are solid, it’s not a comprehensive security audit and shouldn't be taken as definitive. \- I have not, and will not, attempt to exploit any of these issues (I cannot preface this enough.) I put together a technical document with evidence, risk analysis, and remediation steps. If you’re curious about the details (or want to forward this to someone who can fix it), it’s all in there. You can find the writeup here: [https://files.catbox.moe/za03f5.pdf](https://files.catbox.moe/za03f5.pdf) This post isn’t meant to dunk on the devs or play "hacker vigilante." My only intent here is to raise awareness of risks so students (and hopefully the school) know there are serious issues that need fixing, lest people want data being hacked, stolen, or leaked. ...Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaanyway, yeah, we can all agree that the app sucks in performance too. I didn't do that much digging in that regard, but I did find conflicting API and function calls that confuse the program, outdated/decayed libraries, and devtools left in the production environment. This app is just a mess all around, technically speaking (5 dollars says it was at least partially vibe coded). Okay, PSA over.

Are you a CS major? Even if you’re not, maybe you could reach out to the department and get their help in sounding the alarms.

they need to hire some software developers and cybersecurity professionals in IAM

The app feels like it was made by undergrads

You are a hacker Robinhood

WHY did they force us to change

This is crazy...

Well that was incredibly eye-opening and frighting. Maybe summarize your findings and send them to the braintrust at Business Services who managed the project. If they’re interested in hearing more, tell them you’ll be happy to share your work for a stipend or PAP. Get that money for your work! And don’t mention any co-collaborators, software or programming you used so they can’t go behind your back.

Bruh… many banking apps don’t even properly use https or cert pinning in their apps. It’s not just Wahoo Eats. Trust nothing and no one.

hoooooooly shit you may as well just shout your credit card number from the roof of the physics building

Well done👏 CS and Cyber profs should be proud

This is great work, seriously. Never intended on adding my debit card or any card to it. I had a feeling they were cutting corners, unlike Grubhub. I recommend omitting the API keys in the write up because it might be against UVA policy to expose them. Maybe include the first 5 characters.

I'm not sure if you'd be fine on eduroam - usually when a network says it's encrypted it means the authentication process is secure. That said, even if it were safe to use on eduroam, there is no excuse not to be encrypting payment info. This is horrifying.

CS put out alarms about SIS when they started that (it was partially pieced together from a department store's backend ordering system), but sigh, we're still using it, all these years later...

I've already forwarded further info to relevant parties who have inquired. Since I am typing this after the app was pulled, I wonder how it will be fixed. Am I a CS major? Depends who's asking.

Lol have you seen how eduroam works? I swap to UVA Guest for a reason.

uva cs undergrads could do better

You misspelled AI

It definitely was and that’s ok

A white hat.

because $$. that's the primary driver behind all these decisions.

If only I was in it for the money... Regardless, I've done what I can. Whatever happens next with the app is left up to the higher-ups.

If true, then totally fair. Although I think it goes without saying that an app with a million security vulnerabilities is much more brittle compared to an app that just uses HTTP. Not to mention that, reiterating, students don't have much of a choice if they want on-grounds dining, so this is a risk for EVERYONE by default.

Hey - I've got 20 years in the software industry with a focus in high security applications like crypto, fintech, and industrial contol. This is good work. In some of my previous, more security facing roles, this is exactly the kind of thing that separates the real rising stars from the "CS degree and a no-name internship" candidates. Hey u/Wild-Box367 - shoot me a resume in a DM. I don't know if I have anything that fits your timeline or skills but I'll keep a lookout.

All sensitive info in the write up is redacted using asterisks (no worries about leaking), so the only things really being publicized are the relevant source snippets.

Wait hello that’s hilarious who figured that out?

Can you explain this to me like I’m 5? What’s wrong with using eduroam?

You’re a good person for figuring out the security flaws and sharing. Hopefully the next iteration - or if they go back to Grubhub - will be secure.

don’t misunderstand me… this is great work.

I forget who first told me this but I remember CS was using SIS as an example of how not to build things including the legendary scroll bars within scroll bars we're still blessed with.

Simply that the connection is bad and drops a lot. There are a number of spots on Grounds where it will go in and out but Guest tends to not have this problem. AFC, for example.

Thank you! I appreciate you taking the time to explain it!

UVA President Jim Ryan gives nothing burger speech regarding nation-wide education policy changes This is all he wanted to say? That the school would go about "figuring out what we need to do to COMPLY"????? He mentions preserving educational freedom, integrity, and trust; following the truth, wherever it may lead. Yeah right.

i mean does he even have a choice in any of this if there are executive orders to cut certain things?

My favorite little Easter egg in this was him saying uva will continue to protect free speech while not allowing comments on the video. UVA showed us on May 4th that they fold to political pressure even at the expense of students’ safety and well-being. We can’t expect them to insulate us from anything this administration does, especially with the newly stacked BOV.

And once again I remind myself that this is the man who allowed riot cops to attack his students - he doesn't give a flying you-know-what as long as he thinks his golden boy reputation will stay intact.

I mean what do people expect him to do here. He’s the head of a PUBLIC school which works at the behest of the FEDERAL government. Like functionally what I don’t even think there’s any mechanism to defy the changes and if he was going to undermine them, he surely wouldn’t go on record to declare as such or else he’d be even more targeted by the administration.

Y'all forget this mfer is a lawyer protecting the University from frivolous lawsuits (meaning your tuition goes back toward your education instead of stupid shit). You also forget that this mfer is doing a killer job making sure UVA stays a top university and moves up in the rankings (givining you a greater ROI on your tuition payments, which he has also been able to get greater financial aid offers for students coming from families making under 100k a year). TL'DR: if you hate on Jim Ryan, then you are a miserable loser who spends their time looking for things to be upset about.

Jim Ryan would gladly join the administration if he was offered a role

He said absolutely nothing!!

If you are angry over this speech, then you are choosing the path of least resistance. It is easier for you to be angry at a soft target, so that is what you do. This exact mentality is why liberals do not have political power. You waste time turning on your leaders for not handing out tents fast enough after your homes are destroyed by missile strikes, on eachother, when you should be fully focusing your anger on whomever launched the missile in the first place. Ask yourself if you are actually angry about this and really think about it. Are you actually angry at Jim Ryan, or are you frustrated that nobody is coming to the rescue? Instead of denigrating the man anonymously, ask him for the resources to fight back, to support your righteous indignation, and to stage protests. Ask him for things under his purview to help you resist. There is a good chance that he shares your frustrations. This is happening on your watch too if you're just posting here and then continuing along your fruitless doom scroll. There is a reason why fascists have an interest in destroying higher education. Find a way to organize with other students and staff from other schools and go fight for what you believe in. It is a 2 1/2 hour drive from Charlottesville to D.C. What doing with your weekends that is more important than this?

There was one last night at GMU. I was tempted to reply all saying how can you cite sources from the department of education, when it is (soon) abolished?

President Ryan and the Visitors will work to make UVA one of the crown jewels of the new fascist American academy. They have been paving the way for years with all of the "free speech campus" stuff.

What a crock of shit

It’s going to be a long four years if you all on the left can’t stop eating each other.

It was a statement about nothing. University presidents are often political figures but President Ryan has done nothing to affirm the values of this institution. Either in this case or in the case of the hospital and medical school. He's an administrator not a leader, which to me is a sad state of affairs. The students, faculty, and staff of the university deserve decidedly better than him.

If the EO exceeds Article II constitutional powers, and most of them do, then Ryan and the Visitors could join other litigants fighting them in court. They won't do that because they're into it.

Im unsure, but thats not the point. He said nothing regarding his, nor the university's stance on these issues, nor what they can and will do to help the University.

Not when it’s the law…

UVA has a $14.2B endowment with 7.5% annual returns.If that doesn’t buy you freedom you shouldn’t be *leading* a University whilst quoting Thomas Jefferson, a man who ignored the law for what he thought was right. Jim Ryan is a weasel.

The President is not a king! There are very significant limits to what he can legally do via executive order! Just because the federal government gives student loans does not mean they have unlimited control over school policy, and this is especially true if it’s just the President trying to order people around without even a statute to back it up. On the other hand, Jim Ryan’s #1 priority is appeasing conservative activist donors, so who cares about all that.

You have a very sane and rational take. I believe you are correct and I see it the same way as well.

Sometimes justice requires disobedience.

It's very reasonable to argue that one should not comply with what are almost certainly illegal orders. If your commander in the military tells you to shoot a civilian for no reason would you do it? I'd hope not. Same logic applies.

leading by example would be far too dangerous for his reputation. Mentioning thomas jefferson, a man of deep intolerance for intolerable governmental behavior --while among other devious and deeply regrettable things-- in his watered down 3 minute PR talk, is absolutely hilarious and devious.

Public universities are not part of the federal government. The feds have little control over them and mostly just provide funds, collect data, and make recommendations. However, the state does have quite a bit of control and obviously that’s currently run by a Trump lackey.

you should just wear a shirt that says "i don't know what im talking about". jim almost joined the biden admin in the doe https://dailyprogress.com/news/local/education/uvas-president-ryan-mentioned-as-a-maybe-for-biden-cabinet/article_379e49d0-2918-11eb-801f-0b9c33f6f15e.html

American culture is a culture of heroes, from our politics to our culture. We learn propaganda in schools about our societal heroes like Rosa Parks and their brave "individual" actions, and then go home and watch movies where superheroes save cities while the fictional residents of the city wait helplessly for their salvation. If we want to see change in our society, we call our locally elected superheroes and beg them to save us. It's all symptomatic of the pacification of the American people, an indicator that decades of breaking labor unions, terrorizing charitable organizations, destroying neighborhoods, isolating the living unit into little white boxes, turning religious institutions into partisan mouthpieces, preaching personal responsibility to turn the people against the needy, and placing workers under wage slavery conditions so brutal that they barely have time to dream of a better world, all of this has fundamentally broken the psyche of the average person. We've been isolated from our neighbors so long that we don't know their names, we haven't known community for so long that we have forgotten the concept of strength in numbers. Now, we send thoughts and prayers, and wait for our superheroes to come. No surprises here, Jim Ryan is just yet another non-superhero.

Hard to tell if it's cowardice, complicity or collaboration.

who said anything about being left leaning? Any rational person with even a bit of history knowledge would know that those on the other side of education are ALWAYS wrong.

Thin asparagus with a thin skin and tends to zero brain cells? No surprises here!

The university is very diverse in terms of stances on these issues, its impossible for him to take a side without getting backlash, so he doesn't. I personally don't mind it and I appreciate the communication even if it isn't much

What side of the political spectrum do you think most of the endowment doners fall? He can't do much when it comes to these types of things.

It’s not illegal until it’s struck down. Until then they are a public school that has to follow the current law of the land.

Take a look at how much of UVA’s research and health system budgets are funded through federal grants. The school can't afford dto lose them. And our General Counsel is part of the state Attorney General’s office so there won't be any legal help from that source to even put up a legal fight against federal requirements. Want to change things, this year there is a slight chance to tip the executive and legislative balance in Virginia to Democrats. Necxt year, if the worst predictions (in the minds of liberals) happen the better chance will be Democrats taking back the US House of Representatives or Senate. None of which will happen if the Democrats swing too far left in the primaries. Or if the far left sits out the elections in a snit because they would rather have the right in control than vote for a less than far left candidate.

This comment shows that you don't know a lot about history. Many of the foremost scientists, economists, and intellectuals were very strong proponents of eugenics in the 20th century, including our own university. Yet somehow, blinded by your own biases, you conveniently ignore all of the bad things that universities have advocated for and instead only look at the good things.

🙄 the other side of education 🙄

"Pursue the truth no matter where it takes you." This means to fight for truth, no matter the consequences. Communication that says nothing is not communication, it's a retreat from responsibility.

"The university is very diverse in terms of stances on these issues." I'm sorry, you think theres a variety of opinions on whether the university should remain financially solvent and continuing a whole bunch of scientific/medical research? You can say there's a variety of opinions on say the role UVA should play in working with federal immigration officials regarding undocumented immigrants enrolled at the university. But this administration has taken actions to destroy the very foundations of higher education income streams. This current administration is trying to destroy how higher education, and thus UVA, has operated for decades. Institutionally, Ryan has to take a stand against this admin or the university will become a shell of itself. Thats not negotiatiable within the broader uva community

$1.1B in returns every year. Are we receiving more in funds or returns at this point? Use it to continue educating our students because that is what UVA is about. We were the first major university **ever** to be centered around a library rather than a chapel. Stand up for your (institution's) beliefs or get trampled. Don't claim to be a champion of Jeffersonian values and capitulate to tyranny. He is well enough compensated to have a backbone.

That sounds like fascism but with more words.

let alone dismantling the department of EDUCATION. destroying opportunities for a good education to millions of children and young adults.

trying to stop kids from learning "critical race theory" (which is a legal theory not even taught to literal children), banning books, etc, etc, is unquestionably NOT on the side of education

Unfortunately his role is a very political one, he's gotta stay somewhat neutral as to not piss anyone off

You can only fight specifics. Trump wins because he's fluid. He rarely commits to anything specific so that he can claim anything as a victory. He makes big threats, his surrogates smooth the most egregious parts of and tell everyone that Trump didn't mean it like that, people capitulate out of fear, and Trump claims victory without actually doing anything. Currently everything he's done so far is stuck in the courts in some way. Saying the DOE doesn't exist doesn't make it true. He's banking on confusion and fear making people believe that the DOE doesn't exist. It exists until Congress says it doesn't exist.

amen brother

Once again I say, as an institution UVa is very diverse when it comes to political viewpoints. Him having a "backbone" and doing what you want can be very different that another student, administrator, board member, donor, etc.... Also its not like Jim Ryan freely gets to do or say whatever he wants. The entire administration is behind this and likely dictates the message being sent out, calling for his head does not make any sense in my opinion.

If that’s what you come away with then you don’t really have a solid grasp at fascism. I mean this happens from time to time. This is effectively authorization maneuvering without an active supporting structure behind it. Most of these legislations will be struck down though. None of it is being handled in the proper way.

Just moving the federal education function back under the Department of HHS where it used to be. HHS was called HEW back then. (The E was for Education.) Less unnecessary administrative overhead having 2 separate cabinet level organizations. Student loans will be handled directly by the Treasury. The world is not ending. Sorry to disappoint you.

Procrastinating by creating the Rotunda on the Sims >>>

That’s actually well done

dont forget the window on the dome!

Awaiting for someone to do it on Unreal Engine 5.

I was going to comment “dOnT u MeAn oCuLUs” then saw you’re an a-school dropout and lol’d

a. It’s technically in the domain of architectural history; b. i also suck at it so you’re not wrong lol

me walking by a tour group on the way to class

Also if you’re a prospective student don’t take this personally. I toured too. Most of us did.

Actually, that’s the tour group, knowing UVA is just a safety school

*Staff ... ugh, I timed this walk poorly.

Well played my lad, I guffaw at their low SES ways like the pack of filthy jackanapes they are!

Managed to get to my zoom class at least

Seriously, I can’t view my recorded lectures. Smh

Fortunately the mobile version of chrome was working for me -_-

Services are down. [ITS Service Status Page](https://virginia.service-now.com/its?id=services_status_info)

I will simply choose to believe that in an act of solidarity they allowed us students to have a day off

I fucking did it After grinding nonstop (besides to eat) since 9:30am (aka around 14 hours), I finally caught up on the 16 lectures I was being on! Now I just have to make sure I don't get behind again...anyways just wanted to share since I have no friends to share this with

I’m proud of you, been grinding three weeks worth of readings last couple days myself

Wait are you the person who posted about having to do a fuck ton of lectures today or was that someone else?

Ayy let's go!!! That is a lot of lectures to be behind on, but proud of you for catching up :) Hopefully you can retain the info!

I gotta do that this weekend, I’m behind about the same as you were. Good job

I don’t have that effort, and I’m 24 lectures (total) behind. Maybe more, I’ve honestly stopped counting.

This may be the inspiration I needed, tbh. Well done, you!

Needed this as motivation. Ty bro

Nice job, as someone in a similar position with lectures I’m extremely impressed

teach me your ways... first midterm next week, been struggling to balance homework assignments with lectures, usually skip lectures to keep up w/ work load. i learn the material by reviewing notes/lecture slides/textbook readings while doing the assignments edit: my own tips for not falling behind (that i haven't been following this semester but worked well for me last semester) &#x200B; watch lectures while washing dishes, making your bed, folding clothes, etc., basically any chores that don't require moving around the room the whole time

So, so happy I graduated. Even 1 year later I’m feeling extremely happy it’s all over. Wake up sometimes and just lay in bliss at the fact I don’t have some probability assignment due. Seriously, you’d think it’d wear off, but for me at least it hasn’t.

Keep it up, bud. Great work!

should of put it on 4x speed.

Time for you to break his record

A Message to New UVA Students

when I was a first year i was in chi alpha for the fall semester, and when I finally got the courage to come out to them, my core group literally tried to pray my gay away. we were sitting in a circle and the older 4th year that was leading the group led the prayer explicitly asking God to relieve me of my homosexuality. I looked up to this person a lot. It broke my heart and I quit the next day

To put it more explicitly, XA uses deceptive tactics to trick lonely and nervous first years into their extreme religious club under the veil of ‘community.’ They are dishonest, discriminatory, and disgusting

Good info. There's plenty of inclusive communities at UVA. Find one and know most of the university stands with you

They’re a cult. They prey on vulnerable young first years. Steer clear.

They're a CIO, right? If so, then that means UVA is taking money from all students to subsidize a group antithetical to UVA's expressed values. EDIT: yeah, now I googled that and see [the relevant news article](https://www.cavalierdaily.com/article/2020/11/student-leader-in-chi-alpha-christian-fellowship-pushed-to-step-down-after-disclosing-his-sexual-orientation). They are a CIO -- or at least were one recently. Hope they got defunded.

This is a great heads up but can we try to put things in text and not screenshot form for both accessibility and just niceness reasons?

Was active in chi alpha first year and it truly felt like a cult. It started with Monday Night Live, then core group meetings, then discipleship group meetings, then 1v1s, then weekend events, then classes, and more. It ends up being something that takes 100% of your time by having something every single day, and if you can’t fully commit, you are shamed as if you don’t care about your relationship with god as much. I was also shamed for being in Greek life lol

I still don't understand how people fall for those extremely strict groups. Like there's so many clubs and you're scared to get kicked out a club named chi alpha 😭

Sounds about on brand for a Christian fraternity.

I would say to also be wary of Islamic groups. Lgbtq might be tolerated but not exactly welcomed.

What gets me is that if they kicked out anyone has different theological views than Chi Alpha specifically holds as an organization or if they kicked out anyone who previously committed what they believe is sin, they wouldn't have an organization, period. Pretty sure Jesus once said "let he who is without sin cast the first stone". Seriously though, if their rule is to not let anyone who believes differently than them as a Christian participate in leadership, it shouldn't only be an issue when that belief is regarding LGBTQ+ issues. REALLY grinds my gears.

Oooh is there anywhere like this I can join at Virginia Tech?

Honest question - why are homosexuals joining Christian organizations then shocked that those individuals may be opposed to their lifestyle? It’s baffling.

Yup. This is it. Went to the goddamn mug party because I was a stupid nerdy nervous first year. I was involved for ehhh 3 weeks and then very quickly noped the fuck out once I got to know the people. They’re bad news. I say this as a practicing Christian with very tolerant/inclusive social views (we’re not all awful I swear)

I met a girl from this the other day and she keeps messaging me and stuff, seems nice enough though. Im curious what you mean by preying, like is there weird grooming stuff that goes on ps. vulnerable young first year here

It's a group where I made a lot of friends and had a lot of fun. Unfortunately, you don't always know what you're getting into when you get into it.

Right now i’m not trying to fetishize anyone I’m as confused as you dude, I just cannot play Pam. I don't understand how this works out.

Do you have any examples of this?

What is this sub 50 IQ shit I just read

Guys can have boyfriends too. Just saying

You’re skitzing mate

What have you been smoking?? Guys can have boyfriends too you knoq

I thought about giving you an honest answer. Then I looked at your insanely homophobic and racist comment history. nothing anyone says here will appease you.

When I joined XA, I was still unsure about my sexuality (it's not a lifestyle btw). It wasn't until later I really figured it out. I'm sure there's other people in that boat too. Also, these organizations offer a lot of fun and friends, while hiding their dirty laundry. To give an honest answer, I don't think it takes much thought to think of reasons why there are "homosexuals joining Christian organizations"

I have heard from those involved with Muslims United is very accepting of people of all backgrounds (sexual orientations, gender identities) and counters the prioritization of Muslims from certain countries/heritages over others. I can’t say much to other orgs.

Not a direct example, but most Muslim interpretation of Islamic Scripture does not take kindly to LGBTQ, so if you do end up joining one, ask them directly, how a person from the LGBTQ will be treated by them. If they are liberal and accepting as someone below in the thread said about this group called "Muslims United" then its fine. However, if you come across other groups just ask them directly. I know a lot of people will not like my words here, but it is very true that both Islamic and Christian scripture do not take kindly to LGBTQ and depending upon what interpretations an Islamic or Christian organisation accepts as proper interpretation of their scriptures, they might shun LGBTQ people completely or accept them to a degree. EDIT: Spelling

As an ex muslim i simply decided to share what I have seen in my communities that is all.

I'm sorry you don't understand English

Ummm they was asked to step down because they had a boyfriend in thr past. Do you not read anything before you comment?

I would say that this person is outright denying something they’re aware of. They’re not hallucinating and almost certainly don’t have schizophrenia. Let’s not give them an out. They know gay people exist and that guys can be into guys—they’re just choosing to deny these facts and ramble about who knows what.

That is actually great. I am happy to see a muslim org try to be more liberal and accepting.

younger based Muslim orgs are more likely to be accepting bc of shifts in attitudes among Americans in general. It may be that religious leaders (and thus bigger non-college orgs) are less likely to be tolerant, shifting rhetoric and acceptance within those orgs. Id say I know a fair number of younger Muslim and Christians fighting against these attitudes and trying to make change. https://www.hrc.org/news/majority-of-american-muslims-now-support-lesbian-gay-and-bisexual-people I also linked another Pew study below that describes trends across Christian Americans. Let’s be clear that there’s differences in the spaces we’re talking about (Christian or Muslim). For example, Mormon and jehovah’s witnesses had the lowest acceptance levels in 2014. Idk if chi alpha pushes for a specific Christian religion... I would guess that certain teachings are more concentrated than others based on what I’ve heard https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/12/18/most-u-s-christian-groups-grow-more-accepting-of-homosexuality/?amp=1

There’s no way you’re real. You have to be an NPC ahaha so brainless

that is a great thing, but then again, better safe than sorry, best to clear up the air before investing time into any group

Because they hate gay people? It's a recurring issue. There's a bunch of Cav Daily articles about religious orgs ignoring anti-discrimination rules for CIOs because of their "beliefs". This stuff dates back to at least the 80's, I can provide links if you want.

Oh for sure check out the group as best as possible. I just was trying to reassure people that things are changing and there are supports out there—sometimes it’s more difficult to find than others

Logo change from university

Someone pointed out that it's design resembles VT to make it an even more effective prank

Incredible high-level troll

For dear old UV

Jimbo finally listened to our opinions

Obvious and excellent prank. But seriously - all rebranding is terrible. The entire industry is a scam and the new brand is, essentially, never better than what came before.

not gonna lie, he had me for the first 45 seconds, but only because of previous rebrands during his tenure not shaking out so hot

So much butt hurt over a prank 😂

I was really excited to see we are moving forward to be a greater institution from this

This is satire right?

I think i got scared at that point🤣

No thank you.

Is this an April fools thing?

Watch the video til the very end and you’ll see it’s a joke[https://youtu.be/SlUrwzMRsZk](https://youtu.be/SlUrwzMRsZk)

Don't give them ideas for next year. We are merging uva and VT. So UVT.

the commitment to the bit (all the gear!) was absolutely hysterical, I was dying 😂 heard from more than one person who forgot what day it was and got mad hahaha

I remember the Corner Bodo’s grand opening announcement for April 1 after a lengthy construction period.

the new UVA athletics logo with the edgy fedora swordsman

It's not, Jim Ryan released a video about it

When VA schools go full SUNY

This whole thing was so great; the gear definitely was the top selling point!

Which was a satirical video… it’s April first. Edit: can’t tell if I’m just not in on the joke of this thread or if people ACTUALLY think the video is serious….hoping it’s just the former

I can’t wait… we’ll be SUV ;)

No it's just coincidence that it was released today. Video is serious.

Ahem, we're in a *Commonwealth*, not just some boring 'State'. So it'd be called CUVA instead

No it’s an April Fools Day joke. Watch it until the very end.

You make a fair point… wouldn’t it just be CUV then?

No its not stop tryna gaslight ppl

That's the most batshit crazy thing I've ever read.

True, the extra A, as Jimbo said, is inefficient

That would be a little confusing considering Virginia Commonwealth University already exists 😂

It’s an April Fools day prank lol

[https://youtu.be/SlUrwzMRsZk](https://youtu.be/SlUrwzMRsZk) Watch the video until the very end lol

Bro, I don't think you can whoosh any harder.

Mental health day!!! Just wanted to say I am realllly looking forward to my mental health day and glad it is being taken so seriously. Tomorrow (mental health day #3) I not only have the day off from school, but I also have a quiz due tomorrow!!! As well as multiple homeworks, and I actually even have a meeting for one of my classes!!! Thank you UVA, for all you do for my mental health🧡💙

this is my first mental health day where I dont have an exam or any assignments due right after and it feels... liberating. everyone deserves this

I only have 2 quizzes, a project, and 2 hw assignments due tomorrow. Mental health is peaking tomorrow!!!

Oh my god 😍 Thank you for such an uplifting and inspirational post! I also have a class meeting!! Uva is truly so thoughtful. 💙🧡

my mental health has been deteriorating since the beginning of last semester ✨

Please, please report your professor to your dean. This is such a blatant abuse of what a break day is intended to do. Quizzes and assignments are not supposed to be due on a break day.

Exam Wednesday and two projects this week! I feel golden.

I am a professor at uva and this shouldn’t be happening to undergrads. I am sorry your professors aren’t taking these mental health days serious.

I'm so far gone even with the mental health days. I just want to graduate and move on with my life. F.

I am a professor at uva and this shouldn’t be happening to undergrads. I am sorry your professors aren’t taking these mental health days serious.

I am a professor at uva and this shouldn’t be happening to undergrads. I am sorry your professors aren’t taking these mental health days serious.

For real. I’m not in school anymore, but I’d be sending these to the department chair and deans if my professors tried to pull shit like this.

Do you have to reply w the same comment... I get it... you must be teaching Asynchronously ... same video content semester/semester ...

If you are a professor, you have more power than these kids. Shouldn't YOU be taking this to the Deans.... or your own Dean at least? Students may be afraid of retribution. Kids have been suffering for over a year now, they could use some intervention from faculty.

Nope. You assume wrong. Trying to let each student know they are heard..despite the fact they are not mine.

We have as a school discussed. Our Dean reminded our professors at our last school meeting. I can’t take it anywhere without additional information.

Already have. And by capitalizing YOU. You are yelling. No need. Clearly, I care. I posted, I Responded I acted, I reported. I am not the problem. Students have great power in their voice, but there are effective places to do this through the university. Reddit is not this channel. I watch Reddit for different reasons, saw this and reported-the problem is the student doesn’t identify school, department or class/professor

give me my 24 hour libraries back i want to study like a goblin late into the night why the fuck do i have to go home at 2am

As someone who served as one of the the Clemons overnight librarians from 2005-2008, I agree!

Alumni here! They did what!? That's crazyyyyy

I was quite disgruntled to be locked out of Shannon at 5 PM on one of the recent READING days.

One of the more eccentric economics professors at UVA was David McCord Wright. A Harvard-trained economist, Wright taught at the University from 1946 to 1955. Outspoken and, at times, intemperate, he was well-liked by students for his frankness and wit. One night around 1:00 a.m., Professor Wright realized he needed additional reference material and headed over to Alderman Library. To his dismay, he found the doors locked and the building closed. Undeterred, Wright returned to his home at No. 2 Dawson’s Row, retrieved an axe, and marched back to Alderman. He chopped out a panel of the front door, reached through, and unlatched the lock. After gathering the materials he needed, he left a note at the scene: "Any good library should be left open all night. — David Wright"

Not to get up on a soapbox but this feels like one of those things that has a lot of significance when viewed retrospectively. In a very real sense the University **was** the library for decades. The Rotunda is the old UVA library -- before Alderman, before Clemons, before the annex that Echols burned down. The books and the space in which to learn from them is the beating heart of the University community. Students cycle through; faculty grow old and retire; but there are books buried deep in those stacks which are older than any living UVA graduate. I don't know that closing the library at night represents a retreat from knowledge but it does feel like a retreat from the idea that the pursuit of knowledge is the focus of our time at the University. But times change and the world changes with them. I expect someone said something similar when they moved the books out of the Rotunda.

Like libraries at Universities need to understand student life better and stop being a business

I remember waking up at 4am tired as a sloth to go to Clem before one my midterm exams to get a few hours of studying in right beforehand. Are you saying that’s no longer possible? Lame

I am an old head and remember library hours cutbacks in grad school. We were told it was due to funding cuts….but the funding never came back. Wonder if there was a similar explanation at Clemons and if concerted student pressure would help?

it's because of austerity measures from higher up. no $ to staff Clem. take it up with Mahoney!

But football and basketball got another uniform and a new jock palace. Priorities!

This is exactly why organizations like the Jefferson Society and early fraternities were formed; to give members access to private libraries and textbooks 24/7. JeffSoc still maintains a student-donated library in Hotel C - Jefferson Hall

I minored in Physics and one of the professors kept resources in the Physics library, and I was able to get a key to it (I believe all majors already had such) for 3 years. That was sweet.

I got to grounds at 7:30 and was baffled to find that the library wasn’t open.

I have fond memories of finishing up a research paper at 5 AM in Clemons and then going home and going to bed just to wake up at about noon to take an exam. Don’t tell me the kids can’t do this anymore.

Were you the Night Mother?!?! I loved hearing that delightful voice during finals!

Exactly, no more club clem?

Same. Seems cruel and unusual. Am I supposed to study in my dorm room at 5 am by candlelight while my roommate sleeps??

No honor code violations detected.

Based and bookpilled

If that happened nowadays people would be talking about how unhinged Gen Z is lol

did professor wright happen to have any relation to dr. house?

Would be interesting to hear direct from UVA the cause of the reduced hours. If it’s safety, I get it but the doors are locked after hours except for student IDs anyway. If it’s staffing, would modestly increasing the pay help? It would likely be justified anyway with inflation. If it’s lack of interest, I always saw at least a few people there late at night. They’d prefer to not study at home - UVA should give them a space place to do so. If it’s wanting to protect students from themselves and make them go home instead of lose that much sleep over studying, this is a perfect example of needing to let adults (if we still consider 18 the age of adulthood) make their own personal decisions for themselves.

On the same day as the kent state massacre the statue of Jefferson was surrounded by clouds of tear gast while fully militarized police went in on a bunch of criminals They dared to say that genocide is bad Things have indeed changed. wtf is going on

As someone who pulled many overnighters during that time frame, thank you!

Yes. They changed the hours because they couldn’t justify paying staff overnight.

if the compact would have given us 24 hour Clem 4 back maybe it would have been worth giving up all of our principles… >!(normally I hate using it but /s just in case)!<

Talk to the donors about funding priorities. The library operating hours money and the uniforms and athletic facilities come out of two different fund sources under different control. If enough students feel the same about libraries staying open 24 hours, student council getting a library fee increased, or build in to the student fee structure would likely be the best way to accomplish the goal. Dedicated fees, or dedicated endowment funds would come closer to getting the libraries in a level funding priority status with athletics. I expect more services to be reduced given federal and state pressure to hold tuition steady for multiple years.

Wasn't me, you're probably thinking of the lady who did the 5pm-2am shift- she did the announcements I think! I did midnight-8am, when things got really wild.

UVA seems to flip flop on this. I was at UVA from 2015 to 2019 and I know that during that time, Brown and Clem both had periods of being 24 hours. Maybe it’s a staffing issue? I’d imagine this has something to do with money rather than safety.

The cav daily wrote about it, basically they supposedly can’t afford it anymore https://www.cavalierdaily.com/article/2025/09/students-struggle-to-find-late-night-study-spots-as-clemons-library-reduces-hours

We need a 24hr coffee shop in town dedicated to students.

As someone who attended UVA from out of state, I can think of roughly a quarter of a million reasons why they might be able to afford it...

All valid comments. That said, the choice of who controls funding sources, and why they are seperate is a question in itself. The athletic department and its funding sources and disbursements have been effectively opaque for decades. When I was an undergrad we tried to get data from the "Virginia Student Aid Foundation, the one with office next door to the Athletic Department offices. We were told rhey were a "private" entity and therefore not subject to sunshine laws.

Oh I completely agree with you! UVA is nothing if not penny pinchers where they shouldn’t be.

the library has had it's own fundraising staff in the past- i can't believe the cost to keep one open all night woukd be so substantial that they could not fundraiser their way to fixing the issue? feels like less about the money and more and control, to me

Thanks Jim, Very Cool!

probably an unpopular opinion but i feel like uva cares a lot more about their students’ safety compared to other schools likes jmu and vcu. obviously money is a factor but at least they’re trying to do the right thing, right??

You don't want to go back or just want to be told not to go back?

I missed the part where they're forcing grown-ass adults to march back to Grounds at gunpoint.

Stop being mean to Jim!!!! He is awesome and has a longer shlong than anyone on this subreddit

Well they also made a lot of first years happy so

Might be unpopular, but this is the truest thing I’ve seen lmao. It makes sense not to bring first years since in so many schools, they’ve been the ones to break quarantine and gather in HUGE groups. I’m not saying UVA first years aren’t responsible, but they haven’t gone through all of the honor code “coronations” and live through the culture of UVA. We haven’t had any huge outbreaks in cville yet and we’ve all been here for a bit. I’ve seen plenty of people everywhere wearing masks, and for the first time ever, block party wasn’t a huge thing. I’d say the people currently in cville are a pretty responsible crowd While I think UVA definitely cares about first years, money moves is DEFINITELY driving the decision. They make the most money off of them, with overpriced housing and forcing the most extensive dining plans on them. If UVA wanted to *ensure* no outbreak, they wouldn’t bring first years from all over the country into cramped dorms. It’s 100% ASKING for an outbreak for bringing them here. Even if they are responsible. Legitimately every other college that has brought back students have had to send them back While I agree that it sucks that they don’t have a “first year experience” a lot of fourth years are losing their last year because of covid, and first years have three more years to party it up and live life.

Get a life bro

this was not a hot take.

I’m confident we can work together to stop major spread

I mean, there were so many universities that allowed students to come and many of them were able to contain the virus. There were some exceptions but they were few. So I’m not sure it’s pure hubris. Of course the ability to take on grounds is on the students and staff. Either ways, stay safe on grounds

Hubris would be bringing everyone back with no plan. UVA’s plan is nowhere near hubris imo.

People are already partying in groups of way more than what jim Ryan said was remotely acceptable. There will probably be a certain number of cases that are tolerated and then everyone will get sent home

"First act was to announce that in-state undergraduates from families making less than $30,000 per year would receive scholarships covering tuition, room, and board" I just saw a post speculating on the firing of president Jim Ryan. Despite what your views are, i just want you to know that if Jim Ryans first act was making education more accessible, that speaks volumes about the type of person Jim is. I am low income. I work my ass off because i will forever be in-debt to whoever decided (ie, Jim) people in my income bracket are worth a shot. I have talked to many low income students, they are some of the hardest working, most mature, most responsible people you could meet. I think we work extra hard because we know this is crazy to be able to attend an institution typically this expensive without being held at gun point while already having limited income. I feel like i (and many of us) shouldn't be here, and wouldn't be here, without Jims decision to give low income students a shot at a better future.

The Jefferson Council doesn’t want people like you to have access to UVA because you create more competition for their own mediocre kids and grandkids. No university president is perfect, but Jim Ryan is leading UVA well.

President Ryan, from my understanding, is all things considered a very popular figure among the University community. High-quality public education _should_ be available to everyone who has attitudes like you, OP. Regardless of income level, work ethic and character should drive a person’s success in the world. Making UVA more accessible especially to Virginians _is and should be_ a core facet of UVA’s mission as well as our public university peers.

I love the fact that the administration is looking to guarantee housing for more than one year-a direct result of the high cost of housing here in charlottesville. It’s a public institution and should be accessible. I sort of hate the world that may force him out. I want to be in the world that is more inclusive.

This 1991 alumna and many others think that Ryan has been doing a phenomenal job.

The only people calling for his removal are all a bunch of whiny old alumni.

Alum here. If it weren’t for AccessUVA and various UVA scholarships 10 years ago, I never would’ve been able to afford to attend. I had no family, no money; just myself and what I could carry. Today, I’ve started my own business after a successful run in my career. I’ve paid back far more to the state and country than what was extended to me and I do so gladly. That opportunity changed my life. As alumni, when we give back, we do it with the hope that someone else can walk through those same doors. Education shouldn’t be a luxury, it’s a necessity. A foundation for a forward-moving, equitable society. It’s disheartening to hear about the speculations about the removal of Jim, if it’s true, someone who championed access, integrity, and a vision of UVA that many of us still believe in. No one is flawless but he’s done a great job. I stand with anyone who believes in keeping the doors of education open wider, not narrower. Society is owed that much.

I think President Ryan is great, and I really hope that they don't fire him.

I'm an '03 UVA Law grad and had him as my constitutional law professor. He was by far the best professor I had in all three years there, and displayed all the same qualities of compassion, interest and genuine caring for his students as a professor as he did as university president. I was dealing with some personal and relationship "stuff" at the time I was in his class and probably wasn't the most engaged student, and I definitely remember feeling like I wasn't sure I deserved a professor who cared as much about my education as he did at that particular juncture, lol. Anyway, he's brilliant and a genuine mensch, he always has been, and I wish him immense success in whatever his next steps are. I also have many highly descriptive words about the people who pushed him out but I'm not entirely sure they aren't of the kind that will get me booted from this subreddit so use your imagination, vigorously.

With the recent news, this breaks my heart. I owe Jim my livelihood, the reason I’m not stuck in poverty still

Why not try to reduce the cost of attendance for all, rather than price discriminate? Since I first enrolled as an OOS student, the total OOS cost of attendance has increased 4.25x, while inflation has been 1.9x. How does that make education more accessible? While we all feel for low-income students, we also shouldn't necessarily force middle and upper middle class parents to burn through retirement savings and nest eggs just to fund a college education, possibly putting themselves in a precarious position should there be a loss of a parent, an unexpected medical or other issue, or a loss of a business or employment.

Unpopular opinion but if college is supposed to be accessible for all, it should first be based on merit, and also based on what families can afford. A static line drawn doesnt make things more fair for the greater good of all. You could have a single income at 200K in Nova and a 100K income in Southern VA. Their lives may be more similar. Except one gets more for education and another does not.

This is really not it. A lot of people who are doing well, but are really not independently wealthy at all, are annoyed that they are required to fund $40, 60, even 80k per year for a degree for their kid, while others pay nothing.

One of main concerns of the youngkin appointees on the board has been to reduce tuition

And that old whiny group currently controls EVERYTHING in America. I do have to give them credit. They textbook divided and conquered the left with ease. People are still complaining about Biden's age like they do Ryan's missteps, meanwhile some Ben Sasse type grifter is just waiting in the wings to destroy everything good about UVA.

I am still very upset about his handling of the Palestine protest but he’s certainly better than whatever psycho the Jefferson Council would want instrad

Since I enrolled as an in state student in the mid 90s, the cost of attendance has gone up about 9-10x. Minimum wage has gone up 3x in VA. I do not feel sympathy for OOS students, especially when our in state flagship is prohibitively expensive to many, many families stuck in between Access UVA levels and full tuition level, who basically get no financial aid. The solution is not to cut programs that make UVA financially accessible to those who are academically ready but who cannot afford it. Perhaps the solution involves raising OOS tuition or lowering in state tuition. Whatever the solution is, a state flagship should NEVER cost an in state student $53k/yr all in. Ever. I don't care how prestigious it is or how many new buildings they build.

Agreed, but we also shouldn't force middle and upper middle class parents to burn through their assets just to fund an education, while those parents who don't make as much barely have to cough up anything. It's absurd, and it's a way to make sure most people never accrue any significant wealth, other than the very wealthy.

No one is “required” to send their child to UVA. If you don’t think the value of the education, including the community and values that come with it, is worth the cost of attendance, then you can send your child elsewhere.

I agree. Nothings free, so to accommodate low income students, extra financing often comes from the wealthier kids through price discrimination. It feels pretty shitty, doesn't it? Supporting the opportunities of others, then having them attack you for selfishness when you complain. But as long as you continue to pay up, your words have no weight. There are plenty of other institutions you could attend for a lower flat price, but you choose UVA because of its esteem. As long as the wealthy continue attending accredited universities despite the discriminatory pricing, these universities retain the right to exploit them to accommodate the poor.

I was dismissive of Biden’s age this time two years ago. I was wrong. Maybe we should have had higher expectations for our leaders and we wouldn’t be in this mess.

You think the way to help people accrue wealth is to grind lower-income people under your boot a little harder?

Same is true for poor people. "If \[they\] don’t think the value of the education, including the community and values that come with it, is worth the cost of attendance \[and taking out loans to fund it\], then \[they\] can send \[their\] child elsewhere."

You’re not supporting the opportunities of others if you’re complaining about it and looking to take those opportunities away.

The flaw in your reasoning is that current UVA policy, and the underlying values in reflects, is to make higher education more accessible to low-income Virginians. That is the current state of the University that people can reject by going elsewhere. Instead, you are looking to overturn that policy and deliberately make higher education less accessible to people with fewer resources than you. That says all I need to know about your values.

I think higher education is unbearably overpriced for everyone. I'd just as soon push to have the cost of attendance be $15k per year for everybody, rather than $40k in state and $80k out of state with attendant price discrimination based on income and assets.

IOW, you want Virginia residents to subsidize your college tuition when your family hasn’t been contributing to the system via Virginia state taxes. No thanks. Do you not understand how public colleges and universities work? Personally, I’d prefer if they admitted fewer OOS students so that YVA was more accessible to the families that have been supporting it financially year after year by paying taxes in Virginia (which includes sales taxes and indirect taxes paid by Virginia residents who rent their homes).

I don't mind if there is a price difference IS vs OOS, and in fact I agree with you and think that makes sense. I just want those overall prices to be far, far less. One thing to keep in mind is that lot of the best students and alumni come from out of state, especially in a smaller state like VA. It can go to 90% in-state, but it's excellence and gravitas in the country will surely drop. In fact, one of the reasons why UVA is better than UNC is because UNC takes too high a proportion of in-state students. The difference between IS and OOS students there is even starker.

It’s important to keep in mind that only 12% of UVA’s budget comes from the state. Actually, at one point in the early aughts, that state support hovered at about 6%, thus causing some alumni and others to suggest that UVA simply decline all state support and become a private institution. At any rate, Virginia residents’ state taxes don’t provide nearly the amount of support that you seem to think they do.

"a lot of the best students and alumni come from out of state" what "a smaller state like VA" it's the 12 largest state in the US. what even the fuck are you talking about.

12% is still over $280 million in Virginians’ tax dollars to support UVA. If OOS students want to pay the same as IS students, there are lots of other priorities those tax dollars can go to support.

Virginia is less than 3% of the population of the U.S. There are just simply more elite students in the remaining 49 states, by orders of magnitude. That is not a controversial statement.

Then do it. UVA receives so little in state support (and is so expensive for OOS students) that it probably should be a private institution. Then it wouldn’t have to kowtow to scummy politicians that place their non-education-loving, academic-freedom-hating pals on the BOV. Given how expensive UVA is for OOS students, we just wouldn’t allow our kids to go there. The actual Ivies were only $10-15K more, and are a good deal more prestigious. No brainer there for us. [I graduated in ‘88. During my time in C’ville, most of the IS students came from NOVA and were military brats who had lived in VA for maybe three years (thus contributing very little in the way of tax $$ to UVA). I wonder what those stats are now.]

$280 million isn't that much to be honest. It's the delta between oos and in-state tuition (\~$40k) for only 7000 ug students. In other words, you could take \*just\* the ug population, switch from 67% in state tuition to 27% in state tuition, and close that entire gap. (Yes, I recognize there is aid, etc. that affects the calculations, but you get my point) Btw, speaking as an out of state alum, one of the things that made me attend UVA over US News top 15 private schools to which I was accepted was the relative affordability of the oos cost. Back then, the cost of attendance for oos was \~58% of the cost of attendance for the top privates. Today it's closer to 90%. I'd have a much harder time recommending UVA to my kids solely for that reason, even though we are high income. The relative affordability for even oos students is one of the reasons a school like the University of Florida ($45k for oos) is screaming up the rankings. Even UT-Austin is more like $60-65k per year. And, again, speaking as an alum, one of the things that keeps UVA's ranking high is it's high caliber oos students. UVA's selectivity will suffer if it can't attract high quality oos students, as Virginia is not populous enough to maintain the same high quality at a high in-state % as a California or a Texas.

Congrats to the UVa's basketball programs!

Haven’t followed the women’s program in a long time. How is it they are not ranked when they are 10-0 and on top of the ACC?

Weak Strength of Schedule and Tina Thompson.

sorry I don’t follow. I read Tina Thompson’s Wikipedia page. It looks like her stint was a failure as HC. Why would the Hoos be penalized for her failures if she’s not the HC now?

That was just me being snarky about how bad Tina Thompson was that it's carrying over from last year. Our team just hasn't played tough competition like the men. They've beaten Baylor, Indiana and Michigan while the women's only quality win is Penn State.

Got it! Thanks. Yeah, her tenure did look awful.

That's a good pic

Idk what is it about this pic, I am mesmerized

The symmetry is really good!

The subject is on a rule of thirds line, that’s probably why.

Really pleasant soft lighting from Tundy since OP exposed the picture well plus overall symmetrical and interesting composition.

The objective of this picture isn’t to clearly display the people in it.

when the chem building is sus 😱🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣

i was in admin trying to get my laptop fixed😳

sussus...amogus??

So long as it was just chalk and they wash it off later, or it comes off in the rain, this is wholesome fun.

Probably a controversial opinion, but I simply don't understand why UVA lets these "secret" societies deface buildings....particularly historical and beautiful ones. Makes me sick when I see it on the steps of the Rotunda.

Damnit now I have to play among us

Taking the 1895 fire and Stanford White’s additions into consideration, there are some secret societies older than even the Rotunda and Southern Lawn. My point being UVA “let’s” them tag buildings because they play an important role in the history and many traditions of the university for the last 140ish years I can see how some people think we’ve outgrown the secret societies as a concept but on paper they do operate as philanthropic organizations and serve the university as a bridge between students and faculty. I don’t think anyone in administration considers the tagging of buildings (only the Z’s, 7’s, IMP’s, P.R.I. and Claw and Dagger?) as “defacing” Edit: I forgot the 21 Society and Pika’s F

There are plenty of philanthropic organizations across the country that don’t tag buildings. I love it when people pull out the “traditions” card. I’m old enough to remember some of those.

I’m unsure what you’re alluding to with that last bit. Sure, traditions either evolve and grow, or die out over time as all things do. Anyone can donate money philanthropically and take credit for it, but that’s not very esoteric now is it? Another check to the registrar doesn’t contribute to the lore and legacy of the university. Again, no one at the university, either student, alumnus, or admin, sees the symbols as graffiti. As an alumnus(?) and townie, I hope you’ve joined the community at Lighting of the Lawn and seen the secret society’s symbols placed strategically around the Lawn in lights, or the student hillside at Scott Stadium where they’re set in stone. The most “present” of the societies, the 7’s and Z’s, have been around since 1892 and 1905, respectively. Eli Banana and TILKA are even older. To say the society’s symbols goes against the history or beauty of the university would be like saying “Old Cabell Hall ruins the history and view from the Lawn” just because it’s not original to the Academical Village. The secret societies are one of the many things that makes UVA, UVA, and the symbols are there as a constant reminder of their support and it is an honor to be recognized by them

This can’t just be me that does this

I cannot make eye contact with anyone while I am doing it lest they think I’m flirting with them

Hey man there's always next time. Yknow what they say about spit test racing, "You're either a spitter or a quitter"

for me it’s more like: trying not to talk to the check in person to get a head start in pooling saliva so i can leave quicker

I always collect saliva in my mouth on my way there and it's so awkward having to nod mhm to all of their questions and not being able to say hi or thanks or anything

Students call for the University to reject the Trump administration’s Compact - The Cavalier Daily From Cav Daily article: >Clay Dickerson, Student Council president and fourth-year College student has joined student leaders of seven other universities, who were also sent the Compact, in a joint statement calling for their universities to reject it. These include the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the University of Arizona, Dartmouth College, the University of Pennsylvania, Brown University and Vanderbilt University. The statement writes that “as student representatives, we stand in united opposition to the outlined conditions.” >Dickerson cited several [provisions](https://www.cavalierdaily.com/article/2025/10/working-through-the-compact-point-by-point-here-is-what-uva-has-already-done) in the Compact that universities must abide by which would affect student life. These included, as Dickerson described, promoting a “marketplace of ideas,” limiting definitions of gender, revising University governance structures and committing to using lawful force against violent demonstrations. >Dickerson said that these provisions may affect student self-governance at the University, transgender community members and student protestors, among others. >“I think that it would be absurd if the University signed on to the Compact as it stands, especially from a student’s perspective,” Dickerson said. “\[The Compact\] would no doubt serve to the detriment of student life experience.”

I’m hoping UVA grows a pair, but I’m bracing myself that they will not.

There’s a rally at noon today at the Rotunda

So do the alumni

Sadly I suspect UVA is going to announce that their response to the Compact is a new publication: "101 Recipes for Authoritarian Boot"

Bracing for impact. I can only hope in people and our community to make sure it's clear we will accept no answer besides rejection of the Compact

Having a BOV that straight up hates the student body is very sustainable...

Excerpt from a super old 1850s UVA yearbook.

I wonder if they’d consider donating to the small special collection library. They’d love to have something like that. And help preserve it too

Some family friends found an old box that contained this book. Hopefully you get as much of a kick out of it as I did. Sorry if the flair is incorrect, I couldn’t find one that really matches what we found.

This is such a sick find

Would be awesome if we were able to read it, make it your Rosetta Stone!

I believe that's the same Edward Courtenay that the Courtenay house dorm building is named after! I wonder if there are other building namesakes in this book. Fantastic find! Edit: James L Cabell is the nephew of Joseph C Cabell (of Cabell Hall), and Minor Hall is named after the John B Minor listed in the yearbook as well.

This is so cool!

Please consider at least allowing them to digitally archive it

I know its a super late reply, but we did send it to your library to preserve last week, so you can probably go see it in person soon.

Loan it to em. I bet they’ll clean and restore it too.

apart from the latin and french I can read and understand most of it. But it will take some time.

ChatGPT can transcribe it.

That’s that so cool! Good choice. They’ll take great care of it

Got it, looking forward to the update!

It’s a huge hit or miss depending on the penmanship.

Don’t be ignorant to new ideas.

It’s not there yet. Chatgpt is incredibly flawed.

REPORT LUMPY POSTS I’ll be messaging the mods separately, but I think this post is long overdue. I would appreciate if mods pin this so everyone can see this. If you come across a post by “Lumpy,” I strongly encourage you to report it immediately. For those unfamiliar, Lumpy is a troubled individual who repeatedly posts negative and inflammatory content, always targeting and villainizing the UVA student body. Despite being banned multiple times, he continues to create alternate accounts to bypass moderation and continue his behavior. There’s one clear hallmark of a Lumpy post: he consistently blames the entire UVA community for his loneliness and lack of social connections. This individual has single-handedly undermined the credibility of genuine users who sincerely seek help or struggle to make friends at UVA. Because of Lumpy’s repeated posts, there is now always a lingering doubt, such as “Is this a Lumpy post?” As a result, anyone writing about loneliness or social struggles often feels the need to preface their post with “I’m not Lumpy” just to be taken seriously. I also want to caution anyone with good intentions against reaching out to him. Over the years, many people have genuinely tried to connect with him and offer support, but to no avail. He has never followed through, and those who have challenged his behavior often receive disturbingly hostile messages in return. I know there are many people who were just accepted to UVA and may be new to this community. I want to assure to anyone new that the UVA community is NOTHING like lumpy describes. UVA is a wonderful place with a wonderful community and you’ll enjoy your time here. Edit: if anyone sees a lumpy post plz paste this message and report it Plz refer to this https://www.reddit.com/r/UVA/s/MNvpXouoXr. Do not engage with this. Just report and move on

Thank you for finally posting what has been needed for so very long. If the mods aren’t going to pin a post on this topic -which they did at the beginning when this all began, this should be at least a monthly post, and everyone needs to be reminded to report to the mods. Not responding to him is the only way to get this to stop.

This was his response when I suggested the mods find an AI-based mod tool to force his posts into an approval queue: >"I will always find a way to work around it! Nice try, though!" Dude is an asshole. He gets off on the attention. He may be mentally ill but its not the kind of mental illness I can work up any sympathy towards.

I always report Lumpy posts as “Breaks r/UVA rules” and then select “this is uncivil or malicious behavior.” Is there a different option I should be using to report to get the Mods’ attention faster? Can’t they block his IP address or something? I know nothing about computers, I’m a Liberal Arts student haha

I'm gonna be honest, I tried to help them cause yall seemed like yall were not being nice. They seemed nice and listening, but just went back to posting these types of posts, like why, it's so annoying now. Where are the mods when you need them? Can't even request more mods cause the current mods are active on reddit but not here I think.

I think the key is just to downvote. Make it clear he doesn’t represent UVA as a whole so someone trying to get real answers from a well-meaning student or alum doesn’t fall for his stuff

Ya know…the more I read about this Lumpy fella, the less I like him.

I think the comments show exactly why lumpy comments and threats should be left up rather than deleted. There's many offering sympathy and while that's noble (and they absolutely should for people seeking help) they should also be directed to the YEARS of awful posts and vitriol lumpy has spewed. Pinning a post is great, but also being able to search previous threads would be helpful.

He’s still around? I’m an alum and I remember when he was doing this stuff when he was a first year. I thought “maybe he will transfer”… apparently not

Mods are volunteers. They consistently take down posts when they see them. They're just not on full-time. The posts will continue. It's very easy to make an alt on reddit - even though you have to attach it to an e-mail in this day and age. The posts will keep coming and mods will take them down when they see them. &nbsp; Lumpy is known to the university. There's no threats. Their mental health is poor. There's a pretty significant threshold that has to be hit to do anything from the university's end. I'm sure they've been deemed not a threat by the threat assessment team at UVA, otherwise something would have been done. &nbsp; At this point, trolling Lumpy is annoying you more than it is annoying Lumpy. Responding to Lumpy is more annoying to you than it is to Lumpy. This post is just giving more attention to it. Reddit posts fall off the first page of the subreddit when people don't interact with them.

\>loneliness and lack of social connections. Why don't we try to help lumpy instead of shunning her further? understanding of course the risk of receiving disturbingly hostile messages in return, if they are a uva student or cville resident they are worthy of some compassion

I find his posts funny tbh

lol why is everyone butt hurt about some words on Reddit

I think we could benefit from having a mod whose sole purpose is to get rid and ban Lumpys posts asap.

I just do custom response and type “this is a lumpy account “

Spoofing and VPNs can always bypass ip bans btw. Idk if it works on Reddit but it works on a lot of video games

It seemed in the first year that they could block each of his new usernames. I don’t know if that’s still going on and I don’t know about the IP address. It’s at a point that it seems it needs to be taken more seriously, but it sounds like the mods aren’t very engaged right now.

His Ip is probably the school wifi...

IP addresses don't stick with a person or device forever; blocking an IP address is an interesting fiction that is temporary at best, and when the blocked address is passed on to someone else, they end up blocked without understanding why. Go to McDonald's; you get one address, Burger King, another, any business's guest networks, a different address for each. At any one point, multiple people may be sharing the same IP address from a guest network.

Like I said “boy who cried wolf” 🫡

I've given him my genuine advice twice. The first time was before he became notorious... he just replied to me with something like "why do \*I\* have to be the one to reach out to people? No one ever approaches me first." The second time was because I didn't yet realize it was him (my fault) and he just ignored my reply and made a new account to post the same shit a few days later.

https://www.yahoo.com/news/m-psychologist-specializes-narcissists-stop-115203532.html

So I'm not a well-meaning student because I don't like it here? Got it.

It doesn’t work that way since he changes his username, you can’t do a search history. Also, those that don’t know it’s lumpy don’t understand so it’s as if each time there needs to be the PSA and then all the examples of people who have tried -so it doesn’t seem like people are just being mean. Somehow, all of the examples need to be included, rather than people posting and adding energy each time, but I don’t know how to do that. But I see what you’re saying -if this thread could be linked each time he posts (with an explanation) -then people could read the comments here. If we all commit to that and share our support for the original poster who puts up the PSA it might gain some traction. And it shouldn’t go unnoticed that the results of this thread, and the one after the suicide when people were talking about him means that he doesn’t post at all. So it’s the two times that he gets the thing he wants, which is people caring about him. The rest of the time he’s trying to get attention and that’s what needs to stop so more people don’t get sucked in. Each time there’s a post this original post to ignore him should be put up with link to the post comments and people should be told to ignore his post. Finally to stop this dynamic. For all those who think that we are mean, we’ve lived through two years of his constant negativity and attack attacks on the university and the students. It is terribly toxic for all of those caring people who come onto this sub. And it is very sad.

Just to be clear, does UVA admin know Lumpy’s IRL handle and PFP?

It’s not ganging up. Everything in this post is true. And UVA staff have also had issues with him irl. He’s just more prevalent here on Reddit He’s rumored to have quit therapy which might explain why he was quiet for a few months b4 restarting

Read through all of these posts and understand that this is only a drop in the bucket of what this sub has had to live through for two years. No question he has a mental illness (and yes, university knows and he has been in therapy and many have tried to help him only to be burned). https://www.reddit.com/r/UVA/search/?q=Lumpy&cId=f6d19237-76ce-472d-836f-e8b607d15b42&iId=70461391-825f-4074-bb5b-ebf57416c499

You are a genuinely good person. I applaud you for this and if you truly think you can help him you are welcome to. But for a lot of veterans of Lumpys antics there comes a time where concern and compassion becomes indifference (boy who cried wolf).

This has been tried numerous times. Many people have met with him in person. I'm not saying people shouldn't try to help if they wish, but there has been monumental attempt already.

As someone who has tried this, you can't help someone who doesn't want to be helped. They refuse to do anything that might turn things around and clearly look down on everyone else

Been there, done that, Lumpy has chosen to stay beyond any help or support. He thinks everyone should approach him while admitting he only participates in isolating interactions like gaming. He needs some tough love from a professional with the patience and skills to break through his self-destructive ideas of what the world is like.

Lumpy is a him btw. Also a lot of people have tried as prefaced. He does not change. You are welcome to try but people have tried for years atp

You can’t help someone who doesn’t want help.

Lumpy is negatively commenting under prospective students, telling people they will be miserable at UVA and affecting people’s decisions as revenge. It’s not just a lack of compassion for lumpy but not wanting people to change their life plan bc of some nasty person

If you have met and interacted with all 26,000 students then you might have an argument. You get no sympathy anymore because you just want to use this subreddit as a soapbox for your misery and refuse any constructive advice. At the end of the day, YOU have to help yourself, no one is going to do that for you regardless of how much you kick and scream and bitch and moan and whine. You have exhausted all of the good will of the people in this sub, that is why no one wants you here.

This is one of Lumpys alts btw Note how he blames the ENTIRE UVA community and expects others to put the effort and not him 1. Heck, even when I tried, no one acknowledged me, so the advice wasn't even good advice. 2. It's not my fault either that I'm hated. I can't help you all hate me because I don't have UVA spirit shoved up my a** and am not a die hard UVA fan. 3. Yeah, you all couldn't imagine it because you all have those things and are thriving at UVA due to your privilege of fitting in at this school. This response is good practice to see whether a post is by lumpy or not

I don't even go to this school Lumpy, but I found this subreddit while researching information for my daughter who is enrolled for the fall. I was extremely concerned after seeing a post from you, but it didnt take more than a few messages back and forth before I understood that its not the school, its you. Its very obvious to someone who has never even stepped foot on the campus. Im not bullying, I am telling you that you need help, and you will not get it from reddit. Get help, finish school, and move on, but dont drag the entire student body through the mud because you have issues. Everyone has issues.

As someone who has tried to help you in good faith and only received more pushback and blame, your self-victimization is part of your issue. Take responsibility for your own actions and how you approach the people around you or nothing will improve.

There are literally 700 clubs. Seems…hard to have eliminated all of them.

Instead of posting on reddit you should seek a therapist. Reddit is terrible for your mental health, especially right now in the age of misinformation.

if it walk like duck....

I was going to make a long rant about how you should look inward about all this stuff, but instead I'm just going to recommend with all sincerity that you find somebody to talk to about all of this. Find a therapist. Get all this off of your chest. You sound a lot like I did in my early twenties and I turned out to have major depression. Venting on here isn't going to help nearly as much as talking to somebody professional about all this, even if you don't end up having a mental illness like I do. You don't have to keep feeling this way.

This was me during my time at UVA (class of '24). I just went to class, went to lab or whatever, then went home. Nothing really interested me, so I didn't pursue anything else. For some people, school is a lifestyle and a game-changer; for others, it's just a stepping stone. Basically, I understand some parts of what you're saying, and can relate to others. All I have to say is 'pick your battles'.

Who’s gonna tell him that he basically described Reddit as a whole 😭

Probably because a few of us, including me, felt he was sincere about changing his situation. He duped us, and don't want him to get anyone else to waste their spirit and energy helping someone who clearly doesn't want help.

He's giving the university and its community a very bad name with his constant negative posts. If someone, say a prospective student or parent, wasn't familiar with his antics, they'd genuinely think UVA is a place 100% full of evil, entitled people who are not accepting of others, when that's very far from reality.

In the meantime, if mods aren’t intervening when redditors report lumpy , I think all of us that get what’s going on with lumpy should take OP’s post and repost every time lumpy posts. If people stop responding to him, that would be like taking away the fuel for his fire. Maybe we can take turns reposting your message, since the mods seem unable to pin something the way they initially did 2 years ago, warning people and explaining that he was banned from this sub and that responses only encourage him.

omg my marriage pact match finally acknowledged my existence !! i requested to follow him on instagram as soon as we matched and he finally declined my follow request 🥰🥰

At least yours isn’t dating someone :/

OMG OMG OMG CONGRATS 🍾🎉🎊🎈

Awaiting this development for myself any day now

At least isnt straight member of the same sex when you’re literally GAY

thinking about any students that went home for break looking to heal from the tragedy on Nov 13th that are dealing with gun violence in their hometown - Colorado Springs, Chesapeake, and unfortunately probably others that didn’t make the news here. I see you and can only imagine how hard that is.

As a first semester student, I feel overwhelmed. This is like a barrage of emotions.

Thank you for this thoughtful post! Wishing everyone the best

i went to that Walmart growing up, i don’t know how to cope but i know this too will heal with time.

It sucks when you don’t have a home that feels safe. Worked across from that Walmart 6 days a week this past summer. And I live in lambeth right across from culbreth. And i work at the downtown mall where there was two shootings this October. Nowhere seems safe. We need change.

Yup. I leave school early and wake up to news about the CO shooting an hour away from where I'm staying. And then the Walmart one (I used to work at Walmart, though not that one). I'm a fucking wreck and I hate all of this.

Yeah, I came home to another shooting. It seems like it just never ends. We seriously need more gun control!!

I really hope you have family and friends to lean on during all of this. I was a fall semester first year during the 2017 white supremacy attack so I do somewhat understand your situation. I remember quickly learning how incredibly tight knit the UVA community is - anyones loss is everyones loss.

grief really is something, but time definitely helps

Thank you. I'm glad we can relate, somewhat. I don't have family nearby. But, I have a few friends. I hope to pull through this. UVA is expectedly, somewhat empty now, but you're right, there is a strong sense of community and support.

I’ve spent holidays in Charlottesville before, the quiet can be a lot sometimes. If you’re up for it, I recommend taking a walk and trying a new place on the corner. If you’re comfortable doing so feel free to pm your venmo. I always enjoyed grit for coffee and take it away for lunch. Also can’t go wrong with mac and cheese from the Virginian, ultimate comfort (you can even call them for pick up)

Hey I'm sending you a message about a Thanksgiving thing :) I'm a Cville local who lives in Baltimore now, but I'd love to connect you with someone!

Thank you very much. I really appreciate your offer. I've never tried Mac n cheese from the Virginian. It does sound like the ultimate comfort food. A good time to try something new, I guess :)

Thank you very much. That is really thoughtful and kind of you.

Tina Fey White Spot Reference (The Four Seasons on Netflix) Anyone else catch this reference on Tina Fey's new Netflix show? Riff on the White Spot as the group is visiting their old college stomping grounds.

Yesss I loved it - an inside nod to all of us Hoos. Google didn’t even pick it up lol

Yes. When they described what was essentially a Gus Burger I went straight to the internet to see if anyone else got it.

yes!! I had just learned that Tina wrote the script and when I watched this scene I instantly remembered that she had gone to UVA and must have slipped in a reference to The White Spot. My googling afterward took me here - the lone acknowledgement of the reference. The scenes didn't look like C-ville though, so I am guessing they didn't film there. Too bad, that would have been fun!

To be fair, that particular shot was reminiscent of the Corner

State Senate Democrats tell UVA to not consider education compact From the [CBS19News article](https://www.cbs19news.com/news/state-senate-democrats-tell-uva-to-not-consider-education-compact/article_7c3554f1-c6ca-4a20-9222-dfbf8ebb2ff4.html): >The University of Virginia could lose state funding if it signs onto an education compact it received from the federal government last week. >In a letter to UVA Interim President Paul Mahoney and Board of Visitors Rector Rachel Sheridan, Democrats in the state Senate write that if UVA signs the Compact for Academic Excellence in Higher Education, “there will be significant consequences in future Virginia budget cycles.” >The Democrats are calling on the university to cease any consideration of the compact immediately and to notify the Trump administration that UVA will not consider signing it. >“The University of Virginia was founded by Thomas Jefferson on principles of free inquiry and intellectual independence. To surrender these core values in exchange for preferential federal funding would betray not only Jefferson's vision but also the faculty, students, alumni, and citizens of the Commonwealth who have supported and sustained this institution for more than two centuries,” wrote the senators. >The letter points out “internal contradictions” and “unworkable provisions” within the compact, as well as being an assault on the university’s autonomy. >Several groups on Grounds have already spoken in opposition of the compact, including the UVA Faculty Senate.

I can't applaud this enough. Hopefully it has a real impact.

State doesn't pay UVA shit though. This would be the excuse to go private

Have any of you actually read the compact? Im just wondering what is so controversial about it.

Feel the sting of your smallest financial supporter: the state!

I agree. It gives the BOV and interim President yet another reason to even more carefully consider their next steps.

Would require purchasing the land and buildings from the state. Which is a non-starter.

Are there any examples of public universities going private? I don't know what the path would be, but I'd guess that the cost of buying all of the property, plant, and equipment from the state would by itself be overly prohibitive. And, going private likely isn't something that can be done unilaterally, it would require a negotiation with the General Assembly & Governor to make it happen legally.

It still wouldn’t be easy to come up with $294 million in lost state appropriations while trying to keep education affordable. The medical school, law school, and Darden were able to go financially private in part because the market value of the degrees they offer is very high (and it’s my understanding that the medical school can generate revenue of its own). The market value of many undergrad degrees may not be high enough to hike tuition even more and expect grads who aren’t from wealthy backgrounds to be able to pay off their loans. I think there’s an immense value in us not being yet another elite private school. Public schools serve an important role, and we can’t lose sight of that just because we have so many out of state people who want to come here

The state owns the property

How could a public university go private? Isn’t it owned by the state? There’s no way they would let them do that. ETA: was curious on this funding so I looked it up. It appears Virginia provides about $300 million in funding in recent years while the federal government provides about $400 million in funding. That state funding is about 12% of UVA funding while federal is about 16%. While federal provides more, it’s not by a huge margin and both make up small portions of the universities funding and don’t even total up to 1/3 when combined.

I guess you need to start fundraising for a fund to purchase the assets from the state then.

Please shut the fuck up

Yes, I have. Along with various individual elements, the basic premise of the federal government asking for such broad power—absent any legal justification—to micromanage **state** and **private** universities is controversial. There's a ton of writing and news coverage about it, much of which is behind firewalls. If you're looking for writing that highlights some of the most controversial aspects, this is a decent starting point: [https://www.americanprogress.org/article/trumps-compact-with-colleges-will-put-university-presidents-in-legal-jeopardy/](https://www.americanprogress.org/article/trumps-compact-with-colleges-will-put-university-presidents-in-legal-jeopardy/) Also, here's an essay by a UVA professor: [https://newrepublic.com/article/201376/trump-compact-academic-excellence-university-virginia](https://newrepublic.com/article/201376/trump-compact-academic-excellence-university-virginia)

at least they're fucking doing something.

[Compact-for-Academic-Excellence-in-Higher-Education-10.1.pdf](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Compact-for-Academic-Excellence-in-Higher-Education-10.1.pdf) What broad power are they asking for? It sounds pretty reasonable from what I have read, and the federal government can dictate where funding goes and what requirements you should meet into order to be eligible for that funding. Sounds like most of the articles I have read are only against it because it was produced by the trump administration. Had a democratic presidency produced the same document, I doubt there would be any outrage.

Since when has this administration kept their promise?

It’s an erosion of our freedoms. This is America, land of the free. We should be allowed to have colleges that cater to what the students who attend that college want to see. New College of Florida was completely gutted and turned into a far right Christian university by the government of Florida. Even if I don’t agree with it, if that’s what those students and faculty as well as local residents wanted to turn it into, then all the power to them. This is setting a standard that schools would not be free to do this but instead would have to follow a prescribed set a rules from the federal government. It’s unacceptable and everyone should be against any attempt to stifle American freedom.

Sorry, but there is nothing reasonable in an executive branch asking to have oversight of a State University faculty voice. Section 4 literally silences all university employees from speaking out on political events. This is 100% a document to quash any academic from questioning the POTUS. This isn't just about Pro-Palestine protests last year. This is about economists questing tariffs, law schools criticizing immigration policy, medical schools pointing out the danger of our lack of a CDC, NIH, or whatever else RFK Jr dreams up. No school should give this consideration unless they wish to shut down.

By that logic it doesnt matter what this document says, you just hate this administration and are only proving my last statement. Read the document, agree or disagree with it, thats up to you. Im just providing the information that appears to be missing from literally everywhere that people are complaining about it.

They couldn’t have at least made it a 3 day weekend instead? 🥲

Spent my break day writing a paper 🥲

We have four wellness days, and I have a Spanish paper due on all four of them

Not sure about UVA, but other universities have intentionally not made a 3 day weekend in order to discourage using the extra time for out-of-town travel.

I don’t understand why they don’t all fall on mondays and fridays. I would much rather have a 3 day weekend than a random day off

idk why ppl r hatin it’s so nice to have these break days spaced out. you don’t get desensitized as easily if they are all in a row

Little did they know, I essentially have a 6 day break from synchronous classes

The school can suck it I literally travelled home on the break day.

FDU - We're free. With 16 Farleigh Dickinson beating 1 Purdue, UVA is now no longer the only 1 seed to lose to a 16. Wahoowa

I lived in Indianapolis for 10 years, Purdue fans were among the most arrogant and obnoxious fan bases I’ve ever seen, so I certainly wasn’t upset at all to see them get knocked out by a 16 seed!

This is the happiest I've ever been about a first round exit in my life!

They got Farleigh Dick’d that game.

More like Purdon't

Imagine losing to any team that is Dickinson, let alone a team that is only Fairleigh-Dickinson.

Not just that, UMBC is a waaayyy less embarrassing loss than FDU

Purdue needs to win the NC next year to save face. It’s the only path to redemption

Can someone explain the train wreck joke I am dumb

You're welcome. 😢😭

It was awesome hearing the FAU and Memphis fans in the stadium as well as the locals start cheering for FDU. It was “quiet” for the better part of the night save two runs that livened up the Purdue fans in the arena. They largely left after the game, fairly quiet.

Well, we also got curb stomped so…. Edit spelling

Pretty sure you’re the only team to lose as both a #1 seed and a #4 seed, though 😝

We should be thanking them and praising them.

FDU was in on a technicality as the conference winners had just moved divisions and so were ineligible due to NCAA.

Purdue also didn't lose by 20 as the no 1 overall...

1. There was an actual train derailment in Ohio recently. 2. Our mascot is a very handsome "[train](https://purduereamerclub.org/boilermakerspecials/)" which hosts birthday parties. The birthday party thing isn't relevant, but it *is* fun.

Also, as a UVA alum, it was nice to know that we weren’t alone in this exit.

That's definitely worse than losing to 15 and 16 seeds in back to back years, right?

They were the #1 overall in POM and lost to a team ranked like 300th. It's way worse.

Didn't know the mascot was a train 💀 ty for the explanation

Lol it was a joke! Everyone on Reddit takes things too seriously.

Bama was the top one seed

No, it wasn't a joke, it was trash talking. Which is fine, but don't be surprised when you get some back!

UMBC was in the mid-100s, you're arguing about the top 4 spots. FDU is objectively a far bigger upset than UMBC.

Everyone who knows anything about basketball knows that. I'm not sure what this other guy is going on about here.

my daily walks were the only thing keeping me going

You got this!! Sunny, breezy, warm Cville days are coming...

Ain’t that right

UVA football team repainted beta bridge last night

I'm an alumni who also didn't realize it had been so long since it was repainted. Perhaps the football team should leave it like this for a bit and then repaint it themselves. I don't see anything wrong with what happened though.

I like that the football team continues to honor these fallen students, but isn't it high past time to build a permanent memorial? Beta Bridge has always had a history of being painted over regularly, and I would not be surprised if someone comes along to paint it again soon.

I’m an alumn and i was honestly shocked to hear it hadn’t been painted for a year +. Not really the purpose it’s served for decades. Unnamed people painting it blank in the middle of the night seemed like good as any way to move into a new chapter.

Honestly the biggest issue was that the paint was falling off because nothing at beta bridge is meant to last for over a year. Being just about where the whole incident took place, I don't see any issue with a memorial persisting, I think the intended goal of getting rid of the taboo of touching it was partially achieved. The tragedy certainly won't be forgotten. I will say "1 15 41" doesn't need to take up the whole damn bridge but I'm really not worried about someone eventually deciding to do something about that one way or the other.

The bridge doesn’t belong to only the football team. The 17 society is correct that the Bridge should continue to live and change as the university community does.

A proper, permanent memorial should be erected. Unfortunately, tragedies happen and will continue to happen, such is life. Beta bridge has had a unique role at the university for decades. I know it’s apples to oranges, but Yeardley Love’s murder didn’t occupy beta bridge for over a year. I don’t mean to diminish the deaths of these boys, but I personally don’t think monopolizing beta bridge is the way.

The trial is scheduled to begin early next year (Feb 2025) and is expected to last 3-weeks. No harm in honoring the victims until justice is served.

Surprised at the comments in here. 17 should’ve at least asked the football team or the family of the deceased. Tech students painted over the memorial for them.

They planted some memorial trees near the Drama department.

There are memorial plaques at Scott.

Why? Historically, people never asked the prior group for permission to paint the bridge. Would you advocate the bridge be a permanent memorial like the football team seems to be acting? I'd be surprised if the football team or family ever suggest to paint over it, just as any group doesn't want their work painted over, but also knows it's going to happen.

There is also a memorial plaque there

Nobody mentioned anything about a permanent memorial. Don’t put words in my mouth. You shouldn’t put a time limit on grief either. And 17 painting over it prematurely removes the option entirely of the football team or families ever painting over it, so I can’t answer to your last point. Why? Because three of our friends were MURDERED less than 1.5 years ago. Christ.

I don't intend to put words in your mouth. If my child was one of those murdered, I don't think I would ever agree to remove the memorial. I'm honestly curious your opinion of how long you think the beta bridge memorial should remain, and if the family said forever, do you think that's reasonable?

Omg we broke our record! And in record time too!! Goooo hoos 🤩🤩🤩

Ayyyyy natty CHAMPS x3

LFG 🌙 🚀 🚀 $UVA to the moon! 🚀 🚀 🌙

We gotta make up for our fall in the ap rankings 😳😳

Good times go hoos WAHOOWA!

We piss excellence at the University

Now 1186 has two meanings at UVA.

This isn't anything to be proud of, dumbass.

whats the 1st meaning?

it's a joke

The distance from Disharoon Park (baseball stadium) to Omaha (College World Series location) is 1,186 miles, so it’s become a sort of rallying call for UVA Baseball. There’s a really good documentary “1186 to Omaha” about the 2015 National Title run. https://www.espn.com/watch/player/_/id/3629930/bucketId/6200

great joke! almost as funny as the thought of the fact 500,000 people died the past 10 months

😫😫 just tell us BOV I’m begging

uva seems confident so idk... unc was definitely careless. only time will tell. but they better not kick students on grounds after a week that would be sad lmao

nope nope nope nope

pretty much

time to do a ton of work on this break day so i can... spend the rest of the week trying to catch up on lectures

Can we fast travel to the end of the semester?

Imo the profs aren’t assigning any work on break days but the fact that they are just extended weekends means that you still have to work on them for the rest of the week.

John Unsworth (UVA Dean of Libraries from 2016-2025) - "The challenge we face in libraries and in higher education and beyond in the US is government-sponsored fascism. . . . What we’re experiencing in universities specifically right now is a concerted effort to bring us all to heel."

"In a nutshell, the challenge we face in libraries and in higher education and beyond in the US is government-sponsored fascism. This has all kinds of manifestations, and it has all kinds of unfortunately obvious historical precedents. Timothy Snyder is a historian of Eastern Europe in the 20th century who has written exhaustively and persuasively on the parallels. And at this point I don’t think there can be any doubt that that’s the moment we’re in. So the question is: what do libraries do in this situation? 21st-century fascism is not just about governing through force. It’s also about surveillance. It’s about AI in the service of fascism, as a tool of surveillance. It’s about dismembering the public sector, through the Department of Government Evisceration. It’s about systematically erasing history, including data and primary source materials. This is foundational, for fascism—to distort the record or obscure it or simply deprive people of public data so that there is no independent source of fact. We’re seeing that right now. We’re also going to see more intimidation of individuals, more anti-union work, more anti-intellectualism, more loyalty tests, and on and on. What we’re experiencing in universities specifically right now is a concerted effort to bring us all to heel, and also to demonstrate that anybody who tugs on the leash will be dealt with harshly in public and persecuted in private. It’s not going to be an easy time for knowledge institutions, for public institutions, for libraries or for their leaders."

Hi, John! (Hoo, here!)

We miss you, John!

Two things, John, as a fellow librarian, using the term fascism to describe our democratically elected (minus the unelected bureaucrats) government is not accurate. Secondly, universities have shut down, both openly and subversively, conservative speech for decades. This rings hollow and hyperbolic. The very fact that you can publish this article flies in direct conflict with its message. Also, the only recent free speech assassination has been by the radical left.

If I had the time this morning, I could take each of your points and make a similar argument (with facts, not emotion) for how the left has divided our nation to a state seemingly beyond repair. Alas, duty calls.

"I think in the next four years, and maybe longer, there’s going to be a really concerted effort to splinter different communities and to preempt collective action, on any front where it’s possible to do so. There are 50 universities on the US Department of Education’s list of universities that can expect to be investigated over 'anti-semitism'—and I have to put quotes around that, because I don’t accept the current equation of anti-semitism with any opposition to the policies of the Israeli government. I certainly hope that those universities are talking to each other and organizing and coordinating a game plan on the legal front and on the PR front. Collective action is really the only course of action here that makes any sense. And you can tell it makes sense, because there will be an effort to prevent it from happening. As a founding father once said, we must hang together, or most certainly we will hang separately. I think that has never been more true than at the present moment. So for people coming into the universities, people coming into libraries, look to your local, national, and international communities and be a contributing member to those communities. Organize with those communities. Don’t be an island. Don’t go it alone. There is strength in numbers."

Hitler came to power legally in a democracy. He was a fascist. When members of the government are doing Nazi salutes publicly or quoting Hitler, fascism seems like a fitting description. Universities invite conservative speakers all the time. Tons of conservative books as well. The issue is more that conservatism isn’t very popular among educated people, so they get drowned out by being in the educated minority. That’s not the fault of liberals, that’s the fault of conservatisms anti intellectual slant.

>how the left has divided our nation Out of curiosity, could you give just one (or the greatest) broad reason? I'm just genuinely curious. I appreciate any reply.

A false equivalence is not an argument

Absolutely. Where was the pearl-clutching over surveillance when Snowden revealed what the Obama-era “intelligence community” was up to?

Unlike our republic, the Weimar Republic (only 14 years of existence between world wars) was not strong or stable before Hitlers rise to power, and did not have the broad support of the population. Also, prior to 1918 Germany had a constitutional monarchy. This made them prime for the evil fear-inducing population controls and dictatorship of Hitler. Unfortunately, the populace of our country has little support for its federal institutions, due to their frequent missteps and corruptions. However, US polling shows that the majority of people still have faith in our Constitution and the ideals of our Founders. There is really no comparison between the two republics.

We were upset about that too? Why do people keep acting like there weren't protests or people upset during the Obama years?

I'm reminded of something Larry Sabato said, paraphrasing, but most political issues for the public have a half-life of 30 days. Not that I'd necessarily expect one to remember everything from 12 years ago, but the idea that there was no reaction to it and Obama is laughable. You might even be tempted to say the left welcomed the government bailing out of Wall Street! Lol But here you go: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_Watching_Us

Fact: if Snowden were arrested during W or Trump admins, he’d have a Nobel Prize right now.

Yes there is, we started from a stronger spot but we literally have massively funded secret police kidnapping US citizens among others off the street, people targeted by the government explicitly for political speech, courts twisted to persecute political opponents in extremely flimsy pretexts, military marching through the streets, an attempt to overthrow the election in 2020 and all those involved now pardoned and even honored by the government. How much more do you want

Because these folks can’t comprehend that the “other side” isn’t part of a cult that thinks their side can do no wrong.

UVA football is ranked !! https://preview.redd.it/ug8bvbyf9yrf1.png?width=990&format=png&auto=webp&s=268995e8daf957584cad5acc4ab59118b3681e24 AP has just placed Virginia in the AP top-25 for the first time since December 2019!

Just get some 4-star recruits now..

still not satisfied. WE SHOULD BE 1

Don’t get too cavalier about it

well idk if thats gonna hppen after losing to NC State lol

I haven’t done it in so long

it like,... doesn’t talk to any of the other systems...? If I swipe my ID at the gym they gotta ask me if I did my Hoos Health Check. If I tell Hoos Health Check I have symptoms, I can still get into the buildings with my ID. Wth?

My friend has told it she has symptoms on accident before and nothing happens. I literally done understand the point of it 😂

It’s just to get you to be mindful of it I think

Bad meme for bad day

rip hui ma apma 3100 :'(

Phub took out all of the unverified videos down :(

what the hell does the grey O mean &#x200B; thank u

How will I watch my cavman hentai now

Welp I guess it’s time to move to xvideos

New logo = sad Virginia fan

thanks, i hate it

With recent success in sports, what Hoos are sad any more?

Not trying to kill any vibes here, but I simply don’t understand this move at all. We just won a huge national championship, so that logo is now solidified for eternity. Then the next year they try to change it? And to top it off, we now have.....this? We had too many logos to begin with, and we just added a few more that look like amateur clipart.

Well, that didn't take long. Had 3 fellow alums send me this today. Just when I think it's faded away into obscurity...

These logos are shit and Nike should cease operations because of them.

Business move. They changed the logo while merch sales were strong to make more money. Or Bronco wanted to leave a lasting impression. I can’t imagine Tony would go for this.

The article quoted the athletic director as saying that our old logo looked “washed out” compared to the other ACC logos. I can’t even figure out what she’s referring to....a lot of them look very simple (UNC, GT, WF, Duke, etc). The only ACC logos that “pop” are the shitty ones like FSU, Louisville, and BC. I can help but feel like we just got ripped off by some marketing firm that suckered us into this.

me thinking about all the things due on tuesday because monday is 🌈✨wellness day✨🌈

I am burnt out beyond measure. An actual spring break would have been so nice.

I have two exam next week. one Tuesday and one on Wednesday. My WeLneSs DaY gonna be filled with stress

wait i have so much shit due monday night lol

At this point, I feel like my spring break ended after the 1st week of this semester...still another 6 weeks (or how ever many) to go:(

omg really? i thought professor aren’t allowed to make anything due on wellness day :/

I have a bunch of things due throughout Monday morning. I don’t think professors give a shit about the wellness day. I just want a solid 24 hours where I can relax (or at least not do hw) which is yet to happen this semester.

My professor moved our weekly homework usually due tuesday to monday night and I just realized monday is a wellness day man im pissed

This cycle of getting behind & catching up I never gonna end

Quick recap of the most recent uva email for anyone too lazy to read it :)

Fr man fuck admins for closing gyms and libraries

That last email was kinda gaslighting with the whole “if you see something say something” rhetoric

ah yes, we all know the libraries are the biggest super spreader hubs

Really find it hysterical that some of the parents are defending Greek life. Take a look at fall semester... to my stats friends... WHAT is the different variable??? RUSH! Get a grip administration and please inform the faculty that between this latest fiasco and the crazy weather all over the country ALL students are at the end of their rope!!!!! Get a fn grip

Yall know frats weren’t “allowed” events at any point right? We’re all under the same rules

Really. Like, if it *was* the frats, then the people you're blaming for not reporting anything are...the frats? It only works if you presuppose it can't have been them.

I saw someone partying in a lawn room via social media and had names of people who were there and reported it. Admin told me that there was nothing they could do. It’s BS

IT'S HAPPENING

I was there when it happened. I thought that maybe something was up with the trains because of the smoke near the tracks and the ground rumbled quite a bit. Then you have the whole GMU student assaulting fire and rescue side-story.

So that motel was actually owned by my friends' parents. My friend's granddad bought it for cheap back in the 60s or 70s and renovated it with the last of his savings before passing it on to my friends' dad. They built a mini apartment into part of the motel and my brother and I used to always visit our friends there growing up. I remember it burning down, it was so sad cause of all the memories we had there. They didn't wanna sell it to UVA or the city cause it's one of the last memories of my friends' late granddad starting his life in the states. But they've been stuck in insurance hell trying to rebuild it, guess something must've changed. Gonna have to ask them next time I'm back in C'ville

Will be really nice to have that eyesore gone!!!

I wonder if they are finally going to build the hotel they have already had approved.

Every time we drive past that my wife tells me how that’s the hotel she stayed at all the time in the year or two after graduation. Something tells me it wasn’t a very nice hotel.

Wasn’t there some historical significance to that hotel? I think I recall reading that MLK Jr., while a guest at UVA, stayed there? It could all be a lie I have concocted in my brain!

What's happening?

I just visited for days in the lawn since i’m new this year.. passed this whole thing and all i could say was “wow look at that shithole”

I read the caption in Michael Scott's voice

i remember walking past that on my uva tour lol.

I hope they rebuild it.

I watched it burn with some random other people from Culbreth Garage. I wonder why it took so long to pull it down, it has to be a huge money drain to just hold a derelict property like that.

I liked it just fine. It was not top-end, but sufficient. But, they had just renovated and the new rooms were very nice & clean. I stayed there the week before it burned down for Foxfield. I will miss it and its parking lot - perfect for tailgating!

Demolition of the very old hotel/motel across from EIG.

LOL I was wondering if anyone would notice it. Looks like Reddit chopped some of the end off. The only way I can view the rest is using the web page inspect tool.

I actually talked to some people from the city who were aware of the bullshit with this situation. Basically the city didn't want an empty lot sitting there and therefore refused to grant the guy a permit to tear it down unless he had immediate plans to redevelop the land. If he was granted said permit and didn't immediately redevelop the land, which he couldn't afford to do, the city threatened to rezone the parcel as a type of lot that would've raised his sewage tax an absolutely absurd amount.

The owner didn't want to sell to UVA because he wanted to try to get his insurance company to reimburse him to build a new one. Or, maybe he just wanted to make UVA desperate enough to pay him a small fortune to demolish it.

Thank you for confirming I wasn’t totally making 💩 up!!

I really never learn

At least you made a meme about it for free internet orange arrows, sounds like profit to me

And my boy Kihei with the clutch pass.

I was at a sports bar and that was the most hype anyone has been in my entire sports history memory.

Holy shit that entire sequence. That’s gonna go right in the pantheon of greatest plays in UVA sports history. Right next to the ‘95 Florida State game and Ahmad Hawkins’ touchdown in Lane. ETA: that expression has a name as ridiculous as it looks - surrender cobra

I'm jealous. I was worried my dad was gonna keel over from the stress lol. He was astonished watching it; that cussing in the first half to the "holy shits" in the second.

It should be us, in my wholly unbiased opinion.

I’ll be there and will be flying solo, so I’d be down for that!

And the free throws to ice it. Big balls.

If you look at the players celebrations Kihei is the only calm one

given what was on the line it could be the single greatest play

Yep. In terms of consequences the only comparable one might be Nathan Kirby's strikeout of the tying run to win the 2015 CWS.

Chinese International Students at UVA Hello, fellow Asian international student here. **I understand this can be a sensitive topic and I do intend to make this post as respectful as possible, so let's try to keep it that way. :)** As an international student, I definitely found Charlottesville to be pretty eyeopening but also took some time for me to get used to. I have to admit, a lot of us Chinese internationals keep to ourselves and make friend groups for organizations strictly catered for internationals. We use WeChat to converse a lot in Chinese, and talk about things only amongst ourselves. Charlottesville is very different from major Chinese cities, and there were a lot of things that I had learned and got used to living in this what a lot of Americans call a "college town". I am generally a pretty shy person, and definitely felt more comfortable interacting with my small group of Chinese friends from Shenzhen. But I was curious about American students outside of my immediate group. I remember the first time we went to a football game and there was a lot of spirit in the game. We didn't understand the rules at all but had a good time. I think there is quite a cultural barrier and both Chinese and American students find it hard to befriend people across the ethnical aisle. I think I only interacted with American students in certain group projects, but not so much beyond that. One my Chinese friends actually made a conscious effort to befriend some of the so-called "frat boy" roommates we had as first years, and it was actually nice to cross this barrier. We are very much alike and we shared a lot of the same sense of humor. In addition, we did make slightly controversial jokes about our differences, but kept everything generally respectful and courteous and with good-intentions. Through him, I got to know a few great American students and got more out of my shell. I used to be nervous interacting with people outside of my immediate group, but now I feel more natural and also more of "myself" around American students. I was wondering if in the future of UVA, we could maybe start organizations or events that get Chinese students more integrated into American college culture. I know that there are some negative stereotypes about Chinese intl students at not just UVA but America in general, but we also have our stereotypes about American students too. We are culturally different and come from countries with very different political systems. The American media says a lot of terrible things about China, and so does the Chinese media on America. I think these differences can say a lot about our respective governments, but not our people. I think we can find ways to step out of comfort zones and make friends with each other more. I think this will foster a more unified UVA community and dispel some of the commonly held stereotypes we've had, which I think can be a beautiful thing! Edit: I remember back in Chinese high school, my history teacher showed us a video of President Ronald Reagan's speech at Tsinghua University. I liked the speech a lot, and our shared sense of humor really illustrates our commonalities. Then again, I feel like the laughter the Chinese students had at certain points of Reagan's speech was pretty orchestrated. I sympathize with those students- sometimes we are not sure how to act in front of different cultures, and it can be hard for us to not be awkward in foreign settings. I hope we can slowly become more natural with American humor and culture, as many of us plan to establish futures here and want to treat fellow Americans like regular, natural, and even long-term friends.

I think that there are lots of American students (including myself) that would like to see this happen. It’s a rare opportunity for me to meet someone from a foreign country, and there’s a lot of benefit from doing so. I’m a first year so I really have no suggestions right now as to how we might connect on a larger scale, but as another commenter said, maybe Global Greeters and Global Student Council are options. I will have to research those. Anyways, this post has inspired me to find out how to connect with international students, and I hope to meet you in the future!

Hey! I’m glad you were able to befriend Americans (or just students unlike yourself in any way) through your time at uva. There are a lot of great cios that focus on cultural exchange, like global greeters and global student council. I know ppl in both, so if you’d like we could dm or others could send suggestions my way. I know it’s difficult to meet people who are different, so anyone (including Americans) can give their thoughts/suggestions

I felt so so lonely here and I know it’s probably my own problem because some other fellow Chinese students are very social. But I never felt this lonely when I was in China. People would come up to me and ask how I was doing, but in my lab here in UVA, I have to ask for help to get into some conversation or else nobody would talk to me. American coworkers would gather together talk and laugh. I want to share the happiness but I don’t know how, plus I don’t understand them unless they slow down for me. I’m not afraid of jumping in and asking questions but I don’t want to ruin the enjoyable time with my questions so I have to laugh as if I understand what’s going on there. I hated myself for not being good at English, and now I just forgave myself. My brain turned on the protection mechanism so I don’t notice it when I don’t understand their words. I also have no friends. People are nice and would say call me if you want to chat. And I just don’t want to call anyone. I have been here for 2 years. I’ve been through 2 Christmas by myself and another Chinese New Years soon. I had suicidal thoughts and went to see a psychologist at student health. He said my symptoms are very normal among the international students here, especially among Chinese students. I thought right, it’s just some normal struggle that I have to overcome and it’ll get better. But it didn’t. Every time I had suicidal thoughts I told myself my mom would be sad and my family would be ashamed. I do feel the need to connect with people, not through bible study, not some party where Americans celebrate and we just huddle at a corner and stare at the campfire. You made a good suggestion that we should have an organization to help people fit in. We already have VISA, where native students meet with international students. However I don’t think that’s very helpful. Maybe good for my English speaking, but it didn’t get me any friends.

UVa is all about student self-governance. Maybe you're the right person to make a group/event/whatever that helps bring these cultures together within the university?

This is a really cool idea. If anything comes of this and you're looking for members send me a PM!

This is a really good idea! I'm a first year Chinese student at a&s. I spent my entire high school and middle school here in the US, even though all of my friends are Americans now but I could definitely understand the pain for international students making friends from a different culture in a different country! Please dm me and I would be more than happy to help you out or start an organization to help other Chinese students (or international students in general)!!

What is the relationship like between international students from China and first or second generation Chinese-American students?

The speech you mentioned seems to be from Fudan University in Shanghai instead of Tsinghua University

I love this idea of starting organizations/events to get not only Chinese students, but maybe international students in general, to get to learn more about the American college culture. I definitely understand that different students have their own comfort zones so maybe international students like to stick together since they can relate more. However, I really want to get to know international students, become friends, and learn about their culture/background as well so please send me a PM if you are looking for members :))

Chinese American student here. I absolutely love all of the international students that I have met, although this semester has been tricky as it was hard to meet up with people in general. I would love to see something like this happen, and I would also want to be involved! As a person who has been embedded in both cultures, I find myself in an interesting position when it comes to both American and Chinese students. Consider me a bridge; let me know if something works, as I could also really practice my Chinese

I am sorry to hear that. I can understand your pain, it is difficult to make close foreign friends especially with the language gap. As an international student, I also share the struggle of not going home during certain breaks because home is so far away and it is too 麻烦 to take multiple flights, adjust to jetlag, etc. I didn't like only hanging out with international students that much, and I understand it feels weird going to an American party. Me and my other Chinese friend who didn't want to go just stood in a corner holding our drinks trying to figure out what we were supposed to do. I didn't really fit in with those crowds too much either. I've done some awkward things my first year to try to assimilate into American college life, and I think I made a fool of myself haha. Don't worry, it's hard for most Chinese internationals. That is why we all keep to ourselves, eat only with other fellow internationals, and only speak Chinese all the time outside of class. I don't like this, because it gives off the stereotype that we 老中 are rude and very group-oriented. My parents have also advised me to make more American friends if I didn't like hanging out only with fellow internationals. I'm a fourth year and graduating in May, but I'll be returning to Cville for my final semester. Obviously because of COVID, it'll be hard for us to get integrated because of the general lack of social activities but if you want, send me a DM and we exchange WeChat or LINE. We can probably hang out next semester. If you have suicidal tendencies, please do not hesitate to get help!

Thats a great point! That would actually be a great way to learn one of the greatest elements of American culture, self determination! OP doesn't have to wait for the government or some organization to hear his pleas, he can just do it him/her self! There are channels where you can easily start a group at UVA. This spirit of individual leadership is one of the widest gaps between Chinese and American culture, so this would be an excellent way for OP to learn! I know some Chinese nationals who have been here for a long time (and are citizens now), and they said one of the most eye opening realizations they had in America, is that any individual can just start anything they want. Americans "just do it". This rarely occurs in China, and these friends say that is one of the things they learned to like best about America.

Very interesting topic. From my personal experience the two groups don’t have much overlaps in social life. I think the key here for both group is that they’re fundamentally from different cultural background. In Chinese culture race and the notion of being accepted in a larger group plays a more important role (if you look Chinese you’re naturally closer and you’re likely to do so to avoid being excluded), whereas Asian Americans are typically grown up in the American way celebrating individuality. some of my Asian American friends have this identity crisis between their worldview and physical identity. Politics also plays a role but this depends on the political views of the parents.

This is something rly interesting. There’s a CIO called Chinese Students Association (CSA) which are basically American Born Chinese, and then MSN for Mainland Student Network (MSN) for intl Chinese students. They don’t overlap each other a lot, but they did cohost some events in the past. I remember they had a “dating show” once like the bachelor show including members from different Asian communities, including VSA and KSA and OYFA I think. There’s also a culturalfest every year where students from CSA and intl Chinese student groups both perform.

happy they lifted the restrictions but they should’ve just ended the email there ✋

I don't know why people are flipping about this. Eating together indoors has consistently, since last year, been flagged as one of the most risky activities by literally every scientific source. I highly doubt that UVA's contract tracing team is lying to everyone when this is, again, one of the most high-risk activities.

lol you're supposed to eat with your mask on duh /s

I wish people understood math.

Just curious if the administrative staff making these rules limit themselves to only a 6 person pod in their personal lives and limit themselves to only eating with one other person? Chances are that they're even in a high risk category and live off-campus (and risk spreading to the Charlottesville community).

Eating with a mask on: Food: *Beam me up Scotty* My Mouth: *Aye Captain.*

Lets all hold hands and pretend that Covid never existed As I see people walk into Five Guys with like no mask ordering 18 burgers

This isn’t gaslighting. This is an actual problem. When people go outside their pod or bubble and individually eat out with people because it’s “fine” if it’s just one person, they’re increasing their pod mindlessly. There’s a reason why they said you can have pods of 6ish people. You can keep socializing, but be more mindful about where your germs are being exposed

You’re actually supposed to cut a hole in your mask exposing your mouth so you don’t have to remove your mask to eat

People want a scape goat so we can all go about our days with zero additional responsibility. Greek orgs will do nicely for that.

No joke they sell useless masks like that

Yeah period

UVA vs. Duke Upvote this for UVA to win the basketball game tomorrow

Cheap tactic, but can’t risk it

Goddamn karma whore take my upvote

Duke is Puke, Wake is Fake, team I hate NC State Also Va Tech and Uncheat suck too

both are irrelevant when you think about the grander scheme of things

Nerdddddddddd

To those in the class of 28, or those thinking about coming to UVA: I made the best decision of my life coming here. Don't let the posts about social isolation or how awful the school is discourage you. I'm a current fourth year and cannot imagine my life when I have to leave this place. I have found friends in the strangest of places, had my highest highs and lowest lows here, and have made friendships that will last beyond a lifetime. There is no place else I would have rather spent the last 3 and a half years. Don't get me wrong, UVA is not for everyone. And for those who don’t find their home at uva, I know there is a school out there for them. It can be overwhelming and although the school is quite big, you undoubtedly will feel alone at some point in your UVA career. To be completely honest, it can be kinda hard to get out there, but there are people and resources here to help you. Everyone goes through personal struggle, even if they seem like a person who never cries or gets down. Put yourself out there and buy into the system. Trust me. UVA was, and is, intense and challenging both academically and personally, but I wouldn’t trade it for the world if I was doing the college process all over. I am constantly impressed by the student body, professors, and other members of our UVA and Charlottesville communities. There is always some truth to the stereotypes. Yes, there are the preppy bros. Yes, there are pretentious assholes in JeffSoc. Yes, drinking at the school is a very visible pastime (it is at most colleges). Those are just facts of life at UVA, but they aren’t the full reality. Every break I can’t wait to get back to school and get back together with the UVA community that I’ve put work into being a part of. Everyone belongs here and you can find your people, just don’t give up. TLDR: Don’t listen to lumpy, uva is great :)

Just wanted to thank you for saying this. It’s gotten way too negative in here for a place most graduates look back on with reverence. I loved UVA so much that it was genuinely difficult to leave.

From a non lumpy perspective: I have not had a very good time here but not in the way lumpy describes it lol. Honestly, UVA was my only choice (which I was very privileged to have) but I just don’t think a college town environment not near any major cities like NYC or DC (like less then an hour) works very well for me. I like being near metropolitan areas what can I say! Also, I sometimes don’t feel like I fit in with the frat/drinking culture, but that’s a concern to have at any college.

Great post. I feel like the old guy in the room right now, but even still, I am in total agreement. The University of Virginia may not be for everyone, but for many, it fits like a glove. You may have great memories of great times, and a knowledge that you'll have an education that can go with you wherever you find yourself in life. Congratulations to the class of 2028, you are in for the experience of a lifetime.

I graduated in 2022. I miss UVA every single day.

If you're in high school and looking to get into UVa, please don't be a GPA AP SAT bot. Have other interests. Be interesting. You don't have to be the best at everything academic anymore. Everybody has the numbers. Get out of your comfort zone.

If you struggle making friends at UVa, there’s a good chance you’ll struggle at any college. Sometimes it’s the environment, sometimes the problem’s in the mirror…

I fucking loved my time at UVA, and I had social anxiety, had a semester with intense depression... wasn't Greek or a big partier... Just made friends over time and by 4th year I had a group I did stuff with

Thanks for this post. I’m also a current fourth year and I get sad every time I think about how close I am to saying goodbye to this place. It’s not always sunshine and rainbows but I have no regrets about choosing to come here. I feel like I’ve gotten a fantastic education and had so much fun. I can barely remember the bad days at all when I look back on the whole experience. I know I’m biased but even visiting friends at other schools makes me appreciate UVA more. The culture we’ve got here is special. To anyone considering UVA, just remember that the recent negativity has been perpetuated by an extremely vocal minority. We would love to have you!

I firmly believe there is a place at UVA for everyone. I didn't drink for half of my time there, never joined a fraternity or any of the other "stereotyped" groups, and I had a great time and made excellent friends. Not every moment was sunshine--life will always have its ups and downs. But if you give the place a chance and explore, I believe you'll find your spot. For people that are broadcasting negativity, I could think of a number of student groups that they could join that would probably be good for them. I've tried recommending these a few times and found the effort futile with at least some of these people. UVA, like with most things, is a "you get out what you put in" scenario.

As a first year from way OOS, couldn't agree more. I knew one singular person that was going here (I knew *of* a few others, but I really only knew one), and the friends I have made here I know will last. Through clubs or classes or hanging out, the opportunities available to me have made for a truly enjoyable experience. My only wish thus far is that I got involved a little bit more, and I know I'll continue to do that. It is a (small) challenge making friends, that I know, but if you have the ability to keep on trucking and find enough people, you will do very well for yourself. Happy Hoo-lidays!

My two cents- mileage will definitely vary from both extremes of the spectrum. I personally really liked my time at UVA and have lots of good memories from there, but I know some friends who absolutely hated it and one who had the means to transfer out to a different college. No shame in not liking the school. UVA is not for everyone, but there’s no perfect school that is for everyone anyway. The most important thing imo is to just do your own thing and enjoy your own company: find something you like doing through clubs or join a class you find interesting. You’ll be doing it for your own fulfillment, any friends you’ll make is just a nice bonus :) if after all of that you’re still not happy, then for sure reach out and get help. If you can transfer, then do so, but if you can’t, then try and find ways to ease your burden until graduation. Your time is ultimately what you make of it, so make the most of it as much as possible

The best thing I love about this post is that regret of NOT doing something because life is more about the choices we make than those we didn’t! UVA- like anything in life- is what you make it.

Wait what? What do people say about UVA? I didn't know people complain so much about it

Called my uva friend last night. He and i were almost crying bc of how much we miss UVA. You never know when youre having a good time till its over. Screw lumpy yalls uva is a special place

Maybe don’t look on Reddit for advice

This fails to address the major complaint about UVA. UVA generally tends to be a good experience for those who manage to find themselves a good friend group. Things might change up but its important to have a strong starting point. It is a relatively abysmal experience for those who don't. This shouldn't necessarily be that hard; however, one must realize that for those where everything works out nicely early you don't realize that that it only gets harder afterwards. Personally, I've found nothing magical about UVA its just a college with people in it, nor have I found anything especially bad except perhaps the tendency of the student body to turtle up in their friend groups. It feels a little bit too much like high school tbh. Although maybe this is more due to Charlottesville being more of a college town (at least the areas on can find UVA students) than I would have expected from a school in a big city.

Don’t listen to this post. They’re lying. There isn’t a place for everyone here at UVA. It’s Christmas break and I have 0 friends. I’m not looking forward to going back to that hell hole. Some of you will fit in, and some of you won’t (like me). My time here has been horrible. The people here are not the greatest, but if you’re looking for genuine friends, this isn’t the place for that. The only thing you’re going to make here is acquaintances. Friendships are so one sided here and it’s always up to YOU to put in the work for them. Others will not reciprocate. The amount of loneliness, isolation, and increase in depression is insane once you arrive here. Everyone already has their cliques, so there is really no room for you to make any true friends. Again, only acquaintances. So, for those of you like me, do not come here!! If I could do it all over again I would have gladly rejected UVA’s acceptance letter. I did not know it would make me this miserable. Also, all everyone does here is party and drink. So if you don’t do either of those (like me), best of luck trying to fit in. The academics suck and they have grad students teaching classes who can’t even teach properly, which is pathetic. Anyways, good luck to whatever you decide.

Can’t wait till the day I leave!

me too!! i miss my home city (not as big as NYC or DC but still) and i’m not a big partier. fortunately, i’ve still made friends at uva :) since i’ve actually gone to clubs, events, and asked people to hang out! i have sympathy for lumpy cos i do think it’s difficult being queer at uva (as a queer student myself) but my sympathy kind of ends there

This is so valid!

Listen here, youngun... back in my day we had to walk uphill to OHill both ways, through the blinding snow. The food sucked; it was damn-near impossible to get on-grounds housing after your first year, and the frat parties all served shitty American beer. My understanding is that it snows less now. But seriously, I went from UVA to a life deep behind enemy lines in Blacksburg. My wife teaches at VT and I spend a lot of time with Hokies and Radford students these days. So, I can tell you all from experience that the negativity you're seeing on this sub is present across multiple campuses. College -- not just UVA -- is hard. Especially if you've spent your last 13 years in the same school system, you're stepping out of an environment in which you've pretty much known SOMEONE if not EVERYONE for more than a decade. For many students, this is their first time in an environment in which they have to start from scratch, without parents or institutions to create social opportunities. For many people this is a moment of extraordinary liberation; they find themselves and come to understand who they are in a new and profound way. For others though... it's a daily challenge. I would caution any college student against ascribing those difficulties to their institution when it is far more likely to be a consequence of the enormous social shift that is inherent to the college experience.

Not really. It sucks here LOL.

Why? It sucks.

Respectfully, this is a bit misleading. You need top scores AND everything else you mentioned.

Definitely the environment here.

>> if you’re looking for genuine friends, this isn’t the place for that. I appreciate you sharing your perspective and experience, but this is insanely generalized advice that can’t possibly apply to all 20,000+ students at UVA. I made the most amazing connections while I was at school here. It’s been almost four years since I graduated but I am still in close contact with many of my friends from UVA, including my random first year roommate whose wedding I officiated last fall, and my partner who I started dating at the end of my fourth year. When you’re an adult, life is what you make of it. This is why everyone is telling you to approach people and put work into your relationships. You DMed me the last time I responded to one of your comments, disregarding all of my advice and sending multiple messages about how you despise UVA and plan to transfer soon. I hope you can find what you’re looking for. EDIT: the bit about everyone drinking isn’t accurate either. I didn’t drink at all during my college years.

Hope you’ll choose to look inwardly instead of lashing out someday. Self-reflection and awareness is an often sobering and difficult experience, but one that will pay dividends in the long-run.

Don't you realize that no one is agreeing with you?

Out of curiosity, what major are you currently studying

At this point neither can we lol

Go ahead and leave then. I’m a TECH student and I’m not in this bitch shitting on it as much as you are. If you’re having trouble finding friends no matter what situation you’re in at school, consider the common denominator: you. Your posts make you sound like a miserable defeatist who resigns to loss before it even happens. Are you really surprised nobody wants to hang out with you with how you act? Sorry for the tough love but it sounds like you need it

Oh for sure on the queer student part I think it’s not as big as people like to say it is

I have little doubt of that, but even then, it is still not truly universal. There will be some who thrive in their college experiences. I would hope we are just as willing to encourage those who will find that as we are to help those who do not. Otherwise though, I can tell you, you might have to dig deeper to call me a youngun, because I am still just old enough to remember those things. O'Hill? More like O'Hurl.

I am sorry you have had that experience. My suggestion for you is to find what does work for you. For everyone else, remember that this is Reddit. Much like Yelp, the loudest voices are often going to be the one's that are the least happy.

U just have no social skills bro, sucks for u great for most other ppl

give it a rest dude. we all know you hate UVA. some people like it here. your experiences cannot be generalized to the entire student body. i think the amount of negative karma you’ve accumulated in this thread should say something to you

Did you seriously respond to every single comment in this thread

You’re also probably a white woman and straight, so of course you found love. Also, you probably fit well into UVA as it’s just specific races that attend. It’s not diverse at all. No wonder you enjoyed it and had a great time.

I don’t really care? Good for you that you have friends at UVA and are enjoying yourself. Not everyone does or has friends here. Now leave me alone.

I haven’t declared a major yet. I’m only a 1st year.

Yeah college life sucks and so do the people here. People say it gets better, but it doesn’t. It’s BS. I mean even my class isn’t kind. Majority of them came in not knowing anyone and yet they chose to be friends with everyone else and approach everyone else but me? So like it’s BS and not fair. I HATE HATE HATE UVA and the people so much. Also, good for you that you made friends. Not everyone can. There isn’t a place for everyone here at UVA either, so glad you found yours, ✌️.

If you're a miserable defeatist now in college, then good luck IRL!

UVA 🤝 Tech Giving Lumpy tough love

Yeah we are aware? I post a lot because I’m unhappy? What about it?

Clearly captain obvious. That’s why I literally state in posts I can’t talk to people. It’s also clear that it’s good for most people as no one at this university wants to be my friend. Again, as I mentioned in the posts. Are you slow?

Good, I’m glad you know. I will keep saying it until the day I graduate. The negative karma doesn’t say anything to me but that the people at UVA are rude and lack empathy for others. They think it’s so easy to just put yourself out there and it’s not. Not everyone makes friends here. Idk why yall can’t see that or accept the fact. It’s so fucking annoying.

Ambassadors really need to calm down

i was walking with a friend (our masks were on) and one came up and told us to spread six feet apart. on the sidewalk.

Didn't they turn a blind eye to the mad bowl partying?

GReAt AnD GoOd

Lmao this happened when I drove with my friend to spit testing in the garage. We literally had just parked in a space near the start of the line and walked out of the same car.

Yup. Which is why bothering innocent joggers and people studying 25+ feet apart on the lawn and lambeth field is bordering harassment. Unless you’re beautiful, white and in a frat, they’ll target you.

You must have missed this story: https://www.nbc29.com/2020/06/22/cpd-charge-uva-ambassador-connection-shots-fired-west-main-st/

bullshit. lol at even making this about race. &#x200B; edit: i agree with you that these people are over the top and have seen it first hand... against beautiful white people

Anyone else laugh out loud at Dean Groves message? “Don’t walk around near someone, don’t go to a local gym, don’t go home, just sit and your room and lose your mind.” What a joke. Just a complete joke. We should not have to sacrifice our mental sanity to compensate for the University’s moronic decisions surrounding rush and other social events. Honestly, who the fuck ok’s that email to go out? The school is in the middle of a PR crisis, and they think that is an appropriate response? LMAO

Post a copy of the email for the alumni lurkers?

If they maintain restrictions after Friday, nobody who recovered from covid will follow them

if they keep calling everything "covid fatigue" i'll scream. like no, i'm depressed and also so fucking frustrated. but yeah it's just fAtiGuE

The problem with making restrictions so tight is that since they’re IMPOSSIBLE to follow people think: well since I’m breaking the rules anyways having 5 people at my apartment, it doesn’t matter if I invite a few more and do 10

Yeah, it's ridiculous. I got stopped the other day walking to Newcomb with two of my roommates, and we got told to separate. We were outdoors, wearing masks, with the people we *live with*, heading to an indoor place where people can sit next to each other with masks off, and we weren't allowed to walk together. None of it makes any sense

Walking with one other person is permitted under current health and safety guidelines... but stay 6 feet apart. Equivalent to Having dessert before the appetizer is permitted.. but keep them 18 hours apart.

So how is walking “with” someone 6 feet apart any different from walking alone, when we are already required to be 6 feet apart from everyone else?

"Alexa, play 'Too Little Too Late' by JoJo" Seriously this would have been acceptable to send out two weeks ago but at this point it's just salt in the wound. Does he actually expect anyone to take this seriously when we're all paying for the University's and the IFC/ISC's mistake? A "mea culpa" is long overdue.

UVA is a joke now prove me wrong

To play a bit of devil's advocate, what good would come of them returning to normal? It shows their weakness under pressure and their inability to enforce restrictions they apply. For them, I could easily see a *mea culpa* of sorts as essentially giving up, something I don't see them doing. Personally, I see this currently as a lose-lose situation. If they admit fault and roll back restrictions, their authority as an administrative force is diminished and students will still violate restrictions. If they continue to clamp down on restrictions and make empty, corporate statements, people will lose trust in the administration and students will still violate restrictions. One way or the other, UVA gets the crap for it. And as they say, misery loves company.

Quick question. Is UVa testing for the Rona only, or Antibodies as well? NOt sure how it would impact their planning, but surely it would provide some semblance of the prevalence of potential/future 'RonaHoos. Sorry Hoos, it sucks and its awful and prolly doubly so with the weather. Staying in your joint was a lot easier to think about last week than today. Seems endless, but it will end.

it seems like everyone on here is in support of punishing all of greek life for perceived indiscretions of a few. why not extend that to the whole university? same principle, no? &#x200B; edit: on a side note, it almost seems like all that useless outrage backfired. and its not aging well. now you have horrible restrictions for everyone and cases have already plummeted. *golf clap*

"Dear Undergraduate, Graduate, and Professional Students: Good morning. Thank you for everything you are doing to follow the enhanced public health measures temporarily adopted by the University last Tuesday. This message provides additional information related to those measures. ## Walking with Another Person to a Shared Destination A question that has arisen since last week concerns the ability to walk with others despite the temporary “no gatherings” restriction. Although the new enhanced measures do emphasize no gatherings, we’d like to clarify that walking with one other person – to attend an in-person class or obtain food, for example – is permitted under the current health and safety guidelines. It is essential that you are both masked and physically distanced by at least six feet. We ask that you please follow this guidance in the spirit in which it is intended – for walking with a friend or classmate to a shared destination. The “no gatherings” restrictions remain in place. We also ask that you strictly limit exposure to others in the surrounding community who may be more at risk from COVID during this temporary period, including not using local gyms given that our own IM-REC facilities are currently restricted from use. ## Leaving the Area to Return Home or Returning from Home We realize you may have returned home during this period. If you are thinking of going home, we hope you will reconsider. Leaving the area is not advised, given the potential of spreading the virus to family members and others. From a public health standpoint, it will be much better for you to remain here. If you are already home or ultimately decide to go home, you will need to be tested before returning. In addition, it will be important to follow other guidelines around the timing of prevalence testing once you return. All of these steps are aimed at stopping the spread of the virus. You also should update your mailing address in SIS to reflect your physical location. For more details on what to do if you go home, as well as if you return to the area after being home, please see the [coronavirus website](http://click.massmail.virginia.edu/?qs=e7da4d982e42da51b5f5d986cf18adc26fefb0751adf550962d0552f4dd65924455776889933c90269ebb5a169a04889bc059967bcef57de831edd457e6d8c52). ## Remaining Vigilant We understand the enhanced restrictions put in place last week have negatively impacted your University experience in an already challenging time. The truth is we continue to confront a virus in multiple variants that can indeed be fatal to many, and the long-term health consequences of which remain unknown for those who do contract it. The fact you may already have had COVID doesn’t excuse you from continuing to adhere to masking, social distancing, gathering limits and testing requirements. We have seen, both here and nationally, individuals who tested positive in the past and have once again tested positive many months later. The key is to restrict the spread of the virus while we await the availability of a vaccine available to all, which remains months away. ## Adhering to Isolation/Quarantine Guidelines We are testing students more frequently than in the fall semester, and this has allowed us to more quickly identify new cases and get students to isolate or quarantine faster. It is essential that you follow the strict guidelines for isolation and quarantine, including remaining in your assigned space (whether provided by the University or in your personal residence), having food brought to you rather than going out for it, and helping us prevent a wider spread. If we can get the current spike on a downward trend, as we were able to do with your commitment to enhanced restrictions when a spike came last September, we can loosen the current enhanced measures more quickly. We know this is a difficult and challenging time, with “COVID fatigue” shared by many. However, we have to work together to get this under control. Thank you for continuing to summon strength, grace, and endurance in facing the continued threat posed by COVID-19. Sincerely, Allen W. Groves University Dean of Students"

Forget people who have recovered from COVID, non-compliance will go through the roof. They just can't keep this up.

This. I wasn’t a part of the superspreaders, just a victim of it. Regardless, I want to go out to eat/drink with friends this week. I want to leave the hell that is me sitting in my room for 22 hours a day. If my close friends and I all have antibodies, please do not tell me I can’t get dinner on the corner with my friends.

They called PTSD “combat fatigue” once upon a time too...

The UVA administration always was a joke, it’s just even more obvious now

People who couldn't follow the original guidelines are why we're in this mess, not those who wanted precautions to be taken.

You’re an alright guy u/liberatecville

Over 400 of those should be inactive by Friday

Yea for sure, that will be the prevailing sentiment. Also, I doubt Uva would be willing to suspend people with antibodies for going out and engaging in activities that are extremely low risk. That’s just a terrible look and the university causing undue harm.

Yeah, the ambassador people seem to have been told to do this

Yeah, it seemed like one of the ambassadors

so youre saying only diffrence is the testing? no effects anywhere else? in this age group, that pretty seems to be the way it is.

i try. that should count for something, right?

What can I say, I'm not part of Greek Life ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

no i’m in quarantine rn and we’re supposed to get tested at the hospital before getting out

You dropped this \ *** ^^&#32;To&#32;prevent&#32;anymore&#32;lost&#32;limbs&#32;throughout&#32;Reddit,&#32;correctly&#32;escape&#32;the&#32;arms&#32;and&#32;shoulders&#32;by&#32;typing&#32;the&#32;shrug&#32;as&#32;`¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯`&#32;or&#32;`¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯` [^^Click&#32;here&#32;to&#32;see&#32;why&#32;this&#32;is&#32;necessary](https://np.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/3fbrg3/is_there_a_reason_why_the_arm_is_always_missing/ctn5gbf/)

That's not true. Everyone currently quarantined must test negative before being released.

Damn you're fast lol, I thought I fixed it before anybody noticed

Always be aware of your surroundings when peacefully protesting for your fucking rights

Homie on the left looks like he’s fire bombed a tesla dealership. Glad there is undercovers at this.

Police presence isn’t an inherently bad thing

The police is there to maintain order. If you don't break any laws, you'll likely be just fine. However, it's a good idea to know how to interact with the police, and how \*NOT\* to interact with the police. Just figuring out how to identify and evade the police is not enough.

What rights are they protesting for? I assure you they will maintain their right to be spoiled douche bags wasting mommy and daddy’s money. 🥱

Relax, no one’s sending undercover cops to a protest smaller than a Starbucks line.

good advice!

Just wait until OP finds out about the ATF

Undershirt not a vest. Dip or Zyn container, not cuffs. The boots and bracelet are a stretch. You had no idea what the bracelet design even is. The boots are just regular workman’s boots. Wire is the biggest stretch here.

Former cop here. I'm not saying that's not a plainclothes cop. But I seriously doubt it is. Cuffs: That's a zyn or dip can. When I was plainclothes, cuffs went "dirt bag looped" on my belt at the small of the back, one cuff between my belt and pants, the other cuff on the other side. Thick belt kept them from clacking together, creating noise when I moved. Cuffs in a back pocket clack around like a mother fucker. This was common practice. Vest: it's much thicker than that. That's an undershirt under a baby gap t shirt. Boots: maybe? Dude could just want comfy feet when he's on them all day? Bracelet: lol no. No plainclothes cop is wearing that silly shit. That looks like a black stretchy band. Wire: that looks like a insulin pump. Why would he wear a wire? Informants wear wires. Not cops. When I went plainclothes I would often wear a baggy hoodie and jeans. If it was warm I wore a tshirt weight hoodie. And I often didn't wear a vest, but had one close by.

for some reason they almost all wear yankee ball caps too.

Look at all the people hiding their faces with masks 😷 🤡

To be fair, if you *stay* peaceful, the poorly hidden cops won't be an issue.

Hello fellow kids!

You really are self absorbed

What rights are being threatened?

For 40% of police officers' families it is.

Sure buddy. The only one legally allowed to assault and kill a citizen who isn't inherently a "bad" thing. They don't have to have due process if "threatened" when forcibly put into those situations. They legally aren't for the public. If they make a mistake... Oops.

They have a really bad habit of making things worse for everyone

For left wing protestors it is. They have a long history of attacking civil rights protestors, unions, anyone threatening the establishment. For right wing protestors they’re best buds.

There are thousands of cases since 2020 of police committing violence unprompted. If you think that plain clothes cops are hiding their identity so they can maintain order, I think you need to think about that one a little harder. Edit: 40,000 payouts in 10 years but hey it’s okay you can stick your head in the sand all you want. https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/interactive/2022/police-misconduct-repeated-settlements/ Edit2 since I'm no longer allowed to make comments in this thread: I appreciate you taking a critical eye and providing your own analysis. The first thing I will state is that 11k officers is quite literally "thousands of cases" which I know you didn't dispute. Even spread out over 10 years across all 50 states, and making the silly assumption that these people only did one bad thing each...is still a significant amount of police abuse of the public. The next point I'll make is that using the 1% thing isn’t really a defense of their conduct when the other 99% of the institution exists to defend the 1%. Bad officers overwhelming avoid any kind of personal financial accountability due to qualified immunity, they avoid career impacts by virtue of intra-department corruption and absurd union contracts, often receiving token disciplinary actions, and in many cases are quietly promoted, or otherwise they can pack up and start at a new department without any issues. You might have a point if that 1% faced any kind of accountability from their peers. But in fact their peers just operate the ecosystem that defends them and allows them to abuse the public. Real change will come from ending qualified immunity, putting pressure on local politicians who vote on the union contracts with municipal police, and from de-militarizing our departments. None of that is really happening at any kind of meaningful scale. And until it does, trust the police at your own risk. A small but meaningful anecdote is that when the national guard shot the students at Kent State, the public overwhelmingly sided with the police and blamed the students for getting shot. Pretty bonkers stuff and it’s always interesting to watch history recycle itself.

If he was there to “maintain order” he would be wearing a uniform to act as a deterrent. Instead he is attempting to blend in to inflict punishment.

If you don’t break any laws *or* you are a white supremacist Unite the Right attendee. Those are the two cases where police in Charlottesville won’t bother you.

This is a very White WASPY take, an uninformed White take to be exact.

Sure, Adjective-Noun-4-random-numbers!

saying this but they sicd the state police on students in patagonia tents lmao

Funny how you can almost always tell

The police arrested someone in Boston yesterday for writing an op-ed.

Who said rights were being threatened?

Study been debunked

I was assaulted outside Fitzroy one night at 2AM. I was pretty happy cops were hanging around and intervened to bring the perp to justice.

See I think its the racists with masks on that are the problem here. Why hide your face if you believe in your cause so much. You know who wore masks to conceal their identity - the KKK.

I'm not pro police but you're using numbers to make a point while leaving out scale for perspective. I don't have a wapo subscription but it looks like they're highlighting ~11,000 officers with multiple violations. This is terrible and these officers should face serious consequences for this and never allowed to be in a position of power again, nor anyone who is enabling them. There are more than 1,200,000 police officers in the United States so that 11,000 represents less than one percent of police. There are major problems with police but calling out 1% to demonize the other 99% isn't much of a flex. I know I'm a "boot licker" for daring to challenge this narrative but I'd rather acknowledge the reality that not 100% of police are inherently bad or violent based off of the actions of 1% which is the same logic used by the GOP to justify deportations and many other horrible actions.

"Thousands"? Please provide support for your assertions. Did isolated incidents of that happen? Sure, I'm willing to believe that, but not "thousands of cases". This is why I said you will "likely" be just fine, not 100%, but likely. Plain clothes police are in plain clothes for a variety of reasons, not the least of which are because of people like you who think they are the enemy and will act aggressively towards them and make them the target of your anger. In other words, the plain clothes police officers are used in events like this because they want to be available just in case something happens while allowing the protest to proceed and focused on its intended message. Being in plain clothes, they have less protection from both equipment and the law - they put themselves at a disadvantage in order to better keep the peace. Note that your idiotic logic is the same argument used by the January 6th rioters/insurrectionists about the plain clothes officers who folded themselves in to the crowd in an attempt to provide order.

Well, I guess the choice is easy, right?

The title of this post…

No it hasn't. Nothing from the study has been "debunked" or even criticized. The stat is from 30 years ago and from police departments that one can't extrapolate to all police officers and departments across the country. What is absolutely true from all the studies of police officers and domestic violence is that it's a problem for police departments and higher than national averages. Given that studies like this are underfunded and discouraged, for all we know the numbers could be higher, but "debunked" it is not.

Woah, when the cops are doing their jobs it’s a good thing. Crazy! If only there were someone to ensure that they did their jobs and didn’t infringe on our right, kill family pets, abuse their spouses, and break the laws they’re supposed to be upholding. Or some kind of check on their power AT ALL

That’s nice for you the institution at large still sucks. what’s so hard to understand???

You’re lying. The cops obviously were the ones assaulting you and the cops that “rescued” you were in on it to try and convince us that cops are good people when we all know they’re just SS Nazi trump drones just waiting on the order to start rounding up everyone and putting them into concentration camps forever!!!!! /s Does no one know what /s means?

that and the unmarked cops that arrested a student for writing about israel in their newspaper the same damn day you wrote this

Come on, this rally is for free speech! (Just like huts for Hamas last spring was against "genocide").

In NYC several thousand cops rioted when the mayor proposed a civilian oversight board https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrolmen%27s_Benevolent_Association_Riot The 300 on duty police did nothing to control it Police unions regularly protect police officers who commit grievous violations (the few who are caught) and when they are fired they get rehired as police by other places often

WE WON!!! Fuck OFFICE 365

Everyone likes to rip on the administration, but this is awesome that they listened and were able to do this.

as an incoming new student, it still sucks i’ll have to use office tho… google is just better and more familiar in so many ways

Bro I'm an incoming grad student and I was DREADING this thank God Edit: I already got my Gmail account and such so I think I'm clear

They should've listened to us to begin with and sought student input. Fixing something you broke doesn't really mean you deserve credit.

Better to learn Office 365 now. There's a good chance it's what'll be used where ever you end up working. Especially since Google's bumped up the price. Low cost was their advantage. https://suiteguides.com/google-workspace-vs-microsoft-365-market-share/

You can't, unfortunately.

https://honor.virginia.edu/

I don't get this argument at all. Google Workspace and Office 365 have the same core features, just maybe something's in a different menu. I don't see how after an hour of switching, you wouldn't be able to reach 90% of your productivity in the other. It's not like you're trying to learn your first coding language, it's just switching word processors.

Well there's also a good chance you'll be employed somewhere using Google Workspace, tok. Some industries love their O365, but GWorkspace is good enough for e.g. Airbus, All Nippon Airways, the Arizona and Los Angeles governments, Conde Nast (and a slew of publishers), Colgate-Palmolive, Fossil, PwC, Uber, Verizon ... and Google itself, a pretty decent entity.

That’s great and all, and I’m sure there are places Google will be useful, but according to what I liked Microsoft still holds the vast majority of the market share. This survey was also conducted before Google raised prices. And for those who say it’s simple to switch platforms if you have to for work, great, then it’s just as simple now.

Ive worked at Google in the past and my current employer uses gmail, and i will never work at a place that uses O365. Slack + google workspace is the ultimate productivity combo. Most startups and tech companies use gmail/workspace, and I cringe at the notion of opening a word document. Also I totally get that Gmail and google suite aren’t as feature rich, and some industries will likely (and justifiably) never switch.

Yes, it is easy to switch from Google to Office, but no, that doesn't mean that Office is better and that we *should* switch to it.

What a beauty!

It’s all pretty and stuff until you realize it’s too cold to wear shorts 😭😭

not looking forward to going back and having to walk to class in the morning when its 20-30 degrees

Nice. Thanks.

Concerned about Lumpy; Part 2 Last time I posted on here I shared that I felt concern for a student (whose identity I now know well) and their ongoing hostile behavior. It quickly became evident that hundreds of others were aware of this situation as well or had been targets of this person’s online. Since then numerous reports have been made with the university, both with deans and UPD alike. Other than the student attending a CAPS appointment, NOTHING has been done. His behavior is toxic, violent, and targeted toward others online on a daily basis, particularly anyone who expresses that they enjoy the university (or at bare minimum, exist peacefully here). Some days he is more volatile than others. Recently, he has begun making claims of hating professors, hating the community, and hating “everyone” at the university. This is not normal and it is not safe. He is persistent. He has been banned from this subreddit at least four times due to the nature of his posts. This student is a first year, and failing academically. He spends all of his free time targeting other students online, unleashing vitriol and hate. Initially I like many others had given him the full benefit of the doubt, assuming he meant well and that his claims of being friendless were due to being a young person in a new place. I WAS WRONG. He is an unkind individual, mean spirited, and aggressive. He touts free speech and “just swearing” as excuses for his actions. He has attempted to dox other students who have met up with him in an attempt to build bridges. The behavior is urgently worrisome at best. As his behaviors online grow increasingly persistent, threatening in nature, and frequent, many of us grow increasingly uneasy with the lack of repercussions faced by him. I am reluctant to name him as I wish for his safety, but I also know that others likely should be aware of how this person acts. Truthfully I am conflicted. I just want everyone to be safe, happy, and free from being targeted online. Though JustReportIt and UPD are good tools, as is the threat assessment method UVA uses, they have seemingly failed. This person has inadvertently been enabled to continue on their digital rampage.

Here’s what he just put on YikYak: “No one wants to be my friend bc I am a POC. This is why I hate the whites. Earlier a girl made a post about being concerned about me, women suck.”

You couldn't be more right. This is extremely concerning behaviour, yet I'm deeply unsurprised that the university is doing nothing.

The best and only thing we can continue to do is report concerns to the university and try and get the student help; they are sick. Threat assessment protocol has to hit some pretty specific markers for action to be taken. &nbsp; At this point certain administrators in UVA are the only ones that can make something happen.

Thank you for making this post. From what I’ve seen, the community has made attempts to pull him out of this corner where he thinks “everyone hates him”. You definitely have a legit concern about him being potentially violent, and my best response (albeit cynical) is to document everything that he’s said before it’s taken down in case an event does happen, because I’m sure the UVA subreddit and YikYak will take his posts down only then. This is not to say that we treat him in any shape as hostile, because that’ll only feed in to the narrative that everyone hates him. It would be an arduous task to both push him to get mental health and document these potential warning signs, but it’s only possible if there’s someone like you (who knows him personally) to do it. It’s a lot to ask for an undergrad, especially since admin won’t handle it now, so if you cannot, I’d advise for your own safety to have some distance. Please upvote/comment this so others can discuss this strategy and come to some sort of consensus.

I agree, I felt a lot of sympathy for him before but at this point, it’s gone too far. With that being said, I would advise whoever is closest to this situation to file a report with the UJC, this is bordering on a true threat and I, like many of us here, care very deeply about the university community and want to keep it safe. The resource is linked below. https://ujc.sites.virginia.edu/Complaint/BeginComplaint

Report it NOW. This guy could be the next shooter.

I don’t go here but this lumpy guy popped on my feed so I did a little deep dive. What a psycho. This guy needs some serious help that I don’t think anyone posting here is equipped to give him. If it’s more than just online behavior, then id be seriously concerned. Y’all got 5150 in your state?

This sounds like something you need to report to the fbi so they can make sure he doesn’t do anything. this is exactly what someone sounds like before they do something where someone ends up getting hurt.

Are we 100% sure this guy isn’t just a troll that is a sucker for infamy and attention? I feel like only trolls would go this far and make dozens of alt accounts. Ik OP said he/she knows lumpy irl but idk man.

This is concerning to me. And, while I no longer live in Charlottesville, I'm worried for you all. If the university isn't listening, can you report to the Charlottesville police department? Your house rep or senator? Literally *anybody* that might listen and put pressure on the school. Nobody wants another mass shooting (or a suicide for that matter), especially in their jurisdiction. Stay safe.

I was going to say after his last post that he seems to have come unhinged. I understand the fear. I assume people have spoken to the RA and/or escalated the issue?

UVA grad here…haven’t read through every thread about Lumpy but just throwing it out there - can you 302 him? I know that’s a thing in PA and may be called something different in VA. Involuntary hospitalization. Please google for more info.

I don't know why reddit recommended me this sub. I'm not a UVA student, alumni, nor employee. However, I will say I work in higher ed elsewhere and what you describe from this Lumpy person is INCREDIBLY concerning. Keep doing what you're doing--take screenshots before they get removed, report through every possible channel, and use the screenshots as evidence. I hope someone takes it seriously, but if nothing else the UVA community seems to have enough evidence to support a pattern of behavior in these reports--if you haven't used the phrase "continued pattern of concerning behavior" or something along those lines, perhaps add that next time. Be safe out there, Hoos. And in the event that this Lumpy person sees it: please get help. I'm sure you're hurting. Not doing well in college is HARD. But people are worried about you and what you're saying and doing. Please seek mental health help before you harm yourself or others.

Glad this person got in over me (i woulda flunked out faster)

Is there any way to put this lumpy user on some red flag law to prevent him from getting a gun?

Who is Lumpy? What is everyone talking about?

Do you have examples of his writing? Just for my own edification, is he, as a gayman, still looking to join a fraternity? Does he claim to be a staunch anti-breeder from VCU, and is here in this subreddit to simply pass off generic questions requiring broad answers about the social life, and UVA's apparent lack of a gay one? I just want to know, because everyone has claimed to hear from this motherfucker but he be scampering through the woods, blurrily, like Bigfoot.

You should know by now that the UVA administration is too woke to do anything about this problem. This asshole needs to be expelled or forced to withdraw. If you know him, you should be able to locate his parents or next of kin. Write them and put them on notice about the problem. This can be done on an anonymous basis. Perhaps they can get him to withdraw. If not, they may be found guilty of manslaughter when this idiot does shoot somebody--just like the parents of the shooter in Michigan. What about his roommate(s)? Put them on notice. Just remember--it's up to you to do something--UVA will never do anything.

virginia is for lamos

My God this generation is doomed. You really need to post online about someone else's online behavior lol. Good luck in life.

I would’ve shared the screenshot but I do not know how as I’m not really a routine reddit user normally.

This is literally terrifying - i saw this earlier on yikyak and decided to delete the app for the foreseeable future. Whenever someone suggests CAPs or therapy he says that they don’t help him. I don’t understand why he can’t be put on a red flag law, or at least for the university to be made aware of a potential threat. This is also not the first time he has made hateful, dangerous comments towards white women, and gets away with it because he puts “white” in front

I’m surprised too.

Definitely. This week the “I hate all the professors here” posts got too cryptic for my comfort. It’s gotten increasingly sinister and weird. The most uncomfortable thing is how little he has a grip on reality. His perception is completely deluded and it’s scary.

In addition, I’ve have heard of some students who’ve made disturbing comments/actions before, and usually they leave the university due to being on academic probation. Perhaps this might happen to him, and he can finally get support.

I’m sorry you and your friends were forced to deal with this. You never should have had to! With that being said I am also glad that you found a way to get him help, even if it was challenging to do. This may be what is necessary in this situation as well. Hopefully not, but we will see.

>I would advise whoever is closest to this situation to file a report with the UJC, this is bordering on a true threat The UJC has very little ability to react to any imminent threat. Nor should they. This is completely the responsibility of administrators once the concern has been reported. Many focus on these "threat" issues exclusively and others have overlapping coverage. This is literally what they are paid to do. And depending on the actual words and actions, there are the cops. Not just the UVA department but the actual cops in the Albemarle County Police Department.

We do but it has to be very specific against specific people. Even if the paperwork is obtained there are so many ways to prevent the police from serving it.

That’s what I’m worried about too. I’ll look into this.

Yeah he’s not a troll unfortunately

Nope, not a troll.

Yes, with nothing coming of it. He seems more emboldened if anything… Under the impression that he’s vindicated in what he’s doing because they were more concerned about his wellbeing.

Needs to be a threat to self, others, or unable to properly care for self (eg, so impaired cannot feed self, bathe, wanders). To my knowledge, a threat has never been made to lumpy’s self or others, meaning this option is not available

Truthfully I have no idea how that works. Might be smart to explore if someone has insight on this.

He’s a first year who has been posting hate since the fall. I made a post about it earlier during the fall which may provide more background information.

They’re already aware.

tbh most of the students aware of him are concerned to the point they think he's going to do a shooting. i don't know if you're doing irony or what, but i've never before seen a guy so outwardly hostile to the world not turn into some kind of trouble later on.

I know him in real life, offline.

As an honor representative, if you really are one, I'll say this right now: you're not setting a good example here. I dont think many people here think he is a terrible evil person. I don't think that myself. But you're terribly remiss to brush off concerns and just say "eh there's worse". So what if there's worse. The problem here in your face is bad. So what are you going to do about the bad? Let it get worse? So. Structural racism exists. What are you doing about it in the honor system? Throwing your hands up and saying "ehhhh whatever." Either way. You're not the one making the threat assessment. You're not the one to make the judgements. But you are setting a dangerous tone to brush him off.

Deep breath. You’ll be okay.

you are literally a thirty+ year old man reliving your best days by getting into fights with a bunch of twenty-something students lol. the call is coming from inside the house

My thoughts exactly. Reading this I immediately thought “thank god I’m long gone now, the kids gon’ crazy”

The amount of down votes should be even scarier as there are tons of these loser type people today. Even more doomed.

I should add too that he feels emboldened to say that the university supports him… That’s his take away from the meetings he’s had to check on his wellbeing and assess him as a potential threat. Today he’s on YikYak denying he’s ever said anything.

Y’all need to do something before it’s tech v2. Also, why tf does reddit recommend me random college subreddits? i never even went to college and i work a trade

A meme, for these times

The Daily Tar Heel called it a "clusterfuck"

Don’t forget notre dame Edit: and MSU

UVA is just waiting to get past the drop deadline to go fully remote. That way they have your money and you can't pull out.

Haha, I love that. I wonder what Cav Daily will call it...

Please be careful if you decide to drive south I realize that a lot of students are headed south on Rt. 29 because they want to go to the Danville vaccine clinic. About 45-50 minutes south of Charlottesville, you'll cross into Amherst County before getting to Lynchburg. Be very careful in that area and *pay attention to the changes in the speed limit*.

thank you dean j 👍🏼

This was way back in 2009, but I got a ticket for going 10 miles over the speed limit down a hill after a series of hills in Amherst. It wasn't talked down, etc. It was legit just 10 miles over.

Can confirm got a ticket in Amherst a while back dude was hiding behind a hill

Insights into admission and then helpful driving tips - what's there to not love about Dean J?

Nelson County was the one that got me - I was going 12 over. Wasn’t even enrolled at UVA yet! Just headed home after touring grounds.

Great call, the speeding ticket I got in Amherst County for going significantly over the speed limit during third year on the way to North Carolina is proof

I've never *not* seen people pulled over in that area, especially in a curvy section near a bridge.

I used to go to Lynchburg college/family is from Lynchburg and Amherst County is *by far* the biggest speed trap county I've ever experienced in my life. You better go the friggen speed limit until you pass into Campbell County.

I got a ticket for going 7 over in between DC and Charlottesville after a job interview. VA cops 🤝 giving out speeding tickets

10 miles is 16.09 km

I’m pretty sure almost anywhere 20 over is gonna cost you.

This is old data from 2011, but still interesting... >These are the average number of speeding tickets given out per month: > >Amherst County: 394 Lynchburg: 250 Bedford County: 110 Campbell County: 99 Bedford: 97 Appomattox County: 80

Probably because all the fundies are tax exempt.

I believe it 100%.

just a minor correction -- 20 over is misdemeanor reckless driving, not a felony (whereas in most states it's a simple citation). A felony for 20 over would be fucking insane.

Fair; I used to live in CA—in and around LA/SF you weren’t likely to get pulled over (and/or *all traffic* was going 70 in a 50) but just a few miles out of the city centers and your chances increased. Kings County near Bakersfield/Fresno halfway between the Bay and LA was like Amherst

Well, this seems... bad. (I mean, not for Lou if he is retiring. Great for him! Just... I kinda need Lou's List to... you know... do my job...) Also - in before "this is Lou Bloomfield, not Aaron Bloomfield." I'll never be able to get rid of Aaron.

Wonder if a student org can be formed to keep the site alive.

Will the site still work?

Whoops, I probably should have specified which "Professor Bloomfield" I was talking about!

Right? Me too. I’ve relied on it as a first year advisor and for departmental advising. It needs to be kept going somehow.

Honestly SIS is SO MUCH better these days that Lou's List isn't totally needed anymore. I was helping my sister register for classes last fall and was amazed at how much they've modernized the interface to be... usable.

I didn’t like him so im happy hes retiring???

Technically, I was showing the faculty view, not the class search view. The views where I have faculty tools, like class roster, grade uploads, advisor stuff, etc. are not RESTful, and yes, it sucks not being able to use multiple tabs, back-button, etc. Also, I did try to make it clear I wasn't picking on SIS, as I mentioned that SIS is older software that has still been maintained to meet all of UVA's needs. It was just initiated as a project before many modern web development tools and standards existed. I actually don't know if the new interface features are RESTful or not simply because I've never had a reason to use them...because I had Lou's List.. Anyways, don't mind me, I'm going to dress in a Trench Coat and stand outside Lou Bloomfield's house holding up a BoomBox playing Peter Gabriel's "In Your Eyes"

I’m actually really surprised by how much I was downvoted. Whatever — SIS is objectively easier to use now than it was before 2020, especially in regards to finding classes.

Well it's pretty rude given how essential of a resource Lou's List is.

Sorry, [that was an 80s reference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5Y8tFQ01OY) (even though I wasn't even a full year old when this movie came out). It's shockingly easy in your 30s to forget that very few people 10 years younger than you or more is likely to know most of your cultural touchstones.

I think it was the implication that SIS was good enough to make Lou's List unnecessary. Is SIS better than it was? Sure. But just because getting kicked in the balls is better than being shot in the head, that doesn't make being kicked in the balls good.

my bad i’ll dickride him from now on

Stop dissing my lecture style, yo.

Don’t sweat it, you didn’t need to say anything

That's a very fair point. I guess I view this from the lens of my college experience. If Lou's went offline in 2017, it would have been followed by the four horsemen of the apocalypse. Now, it's like a really inconvenient breakup.

Can’t wait to never see this again!

I don't understand the initial thought process for making it.

Heard a comment on here a while ago that they called about this exact same thing, and the person said they don’t even check unless you consistently report symptoms. It’s literally fucking useless and everyone always lies about doing it at the gyms anyways

>Maybe it was for PR or to cover themselves legally? This explains the reasoning for 95% of administrative decisions

Yeah, I was in that boat. Riskiest covid exposure all week was the testing

If you just set your address to some place outside Charlottesville you could have avoided it all together. I didn’t do this, but it was a loop hole

New York Times: "What the University of Virginia Should Have Done" (Guest Essay)

President Ryan didn't resign voluntarily. He was forced out by a cowardly Board of Visitors that abdicated its responsibility to represent the best interests of the University. Instead of fighting the DOJ's unfounded allegations and improper demands to remove the President Ryan, some members of the Board of Visitors were likely working with the DOJ, America First Legal Foundation, and Jefferson Council to push out President Ryan. If Spanberger wins in the fall, she should remove every member of the Board of Visitors who either pushed for President Ryan's resignation or failed to fight against it.

**New York Times Opinion: "What the University of Virginia Should Have Done"** **By Timothy J. Heaphy** Mr. Heaphy is the former university counsel for the University of Virginia. LINK: https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/30/opinion/university-of-virginia-doj-trump.html *"On Friday, Jim Ryan stood on the lawn of Carr’s Hill, the residence of the president of the University of Virginia, alone in the center of a crowd of supporters. He offered brief remarks about his inability to fight the forces arrayed against him, including the Trump administration. No one stood alongside him — it was just the university president, Mr. Ryan, explaining why he had made the difficult decision to quit.* *The moment perfectly illustrated how Mr. Ryan was abandoned by the same people who were supposed to protect the university. **Under investigation by the Justice Department, the university had a strong defense, if only it had the courage to assert it. Instead of fighting back against what I believe to be false accusations that the university was violating federal law, and the even more outrageous demand that Mr. Ryan resign as a remedy for those alleged violations, the university’s Board of Visitors pushed out a popular president. Instead of presenting facts and law, the board waved the white flag of surrender. Mr. Ryan’s resignation is a victory for intimidation and fear over the rule of law."*** ... *"While the university’s compliance with Title VI is clear to me, it was challenged by the Justice Department. Informed by the advocacy of the America First Legal Foundation, an organization founded by the current White House deputy chief of staff, Stephen Miller, the department alleged that the university’s compliance efforts were insufficient, a mere relabeling of D.E.I. programs that broke the law. The department’s proposed remedy was the resignation of the university’s leader — a shocking move that reveals the personal animus behind the investigation. The administration would rather oust a leader than force compliance with a particular policy.* *The hammer wielded by the Justice Department was the potential cessation of federal grant funding. The university had viable legal options to block this effort, too. Harvard University has persuasively argued that the university has a First Amendment right to pursue programs that promote a broadly diverse community and deserves due process before grants are removed. While the Harvard case remains pending, most higher education lawyers predict success for the university.* *Instead of asserting these valid defenses, the University of Virginia opted to capitulate to the demand for Mr. Ryan’s resignation, tacitly agreeing with the notion that the university somehow engaged in illegal racial discrimination.* *Why? By law, the university and all state agencies are represented by the attorney general of Virginia. The current attorney general has been an outspoken opponent of D.E.I. programs. He joined Virginia’s governor, Glenn Youngkin, in applauding the university’s dismantling of D.E.I. programs in March 2025. **This means rather than having an advocate loyal to the university and its interests, Mr. Ryan and the university were saddled with counsel aligned with the other side.* *The university’s governing board took a similar position. The majority of the current board was appointed by Mr. Youngkin, who has said, 'D.E.I. is done at the University of Virginia.' **In failing to assert these valid legal defenses, the board abdicated its responsibility to protect the university and defend it against unfounded allegations."*** ... *"Mr. Ryan was known to urge the university to be both 'great and good' in all its endeavors. His departure will result in a less inclusive university community, which will harm all students who choose the University of Virginia. It is a sad day for the university, which will suffer the consequences of this bad decision."*

Stand with Jim Ryan. I know it isn’t much now but at the very least all alumni need to stop donating while the BOV is filled with unethical miscreants.

This is happening in smaller places, too. My school district lost a fantastic superintendent just because Moms for Liberty thought they had a mandate. Turns out they didn't. These people are idiots.

No paywall: https://archive.ph/2025.06.30-113252/https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/30/opinion/university-of-virginia-doj-trump.html

Treat Trump like the TACO salad he is.

Is there anywhere we can organize to protect the university? I would love to join a Facebook or discord or anywhere we in charlottesville can plan to protect the freedoms of the students and faculty of the University. If one dosn't exist I would be interested in starting one, message me if you know anything or are interested.

Such an insensitive and pathetic title, yeah people like quitting their job that they like.

It’s just a job. Attaching moral, political & sky-is-falling significance is creating a tempest in a teapot. What would TJ do? Take a walk? A nap? Pausing is always an option.

Maybe Ryan is guilty of not following the law?

Despite what Mr. Heaphy says, DEI is discriminatory as it promotes "equity" as opposed to "equitable." At UVA, it was discriminatory and also resulted in administrative bloat, costing millions of dollars. President Trump and Governor Youngkin set about to eliminate DEI, and UVA "complied", but only relabeled it and never fired a single DEI employee. More and more BOV members have been questioning this, urging that the DEI salaries should be eliminated and applied to reduce tuition costs. Ryan stonewalled and never showed the BOV (or anyone else) how DEI and attendant salaries were being eliminated. The BOV was going to fire him anyway after Youngkin appointed the next round of BOV members in July. Ryan knew this and opted to resign in order to be fawned over and considered a martyr. Don't cry for Ryan--he is smart and cunning. If he wishes, he can become a tenured UVA professor at 75% of his huge salary. But I doubt he will choose this option, as I am betting his application for President of Harvard has risen to the top of the list. Whereever he goes, he will (and should) take JJ Wagner Davis with him. She is so full of hubris now that she regularly disparages BOV members publicly, and Ryan never reprimands her. She obviously has a back up plan when Ryan departs.

Dems- I’m so angry we aren’t allowed to be racist with our admissions and hiring. Waaaaaaaaaa

Unwinding the damage will take the entirety of Spanberger’s term. The BOV members are appointed to staggered 4 year terms. So whatever stooge the BOV names will get to sit in the office for at least 2 years before they have enough seats to vote them out.

President Ryan deleted, too Go Hokies!

Do you really believe that “the best interests of the University” was to go to war with the federal government over this issue?

Very funny this was deleted as it proves my point. Merit and hard work should be only qualifications at any institution. When folks point its deleted. Hence left fascism

The board aren’t cowards, they’re malicious, they’ve been pushing for an excuse to fire Jim forever

fuck tim heaphy!!! he's the guy who covered up the utter failures of his buddy mike signer and the rest of charlottesville's incompetent government leading up to and during the unite the right rally.

The problem with this logic is that the BOV are Trumpers who share his values and had no desire to fight on behalf of the university’s independence or freedom. They want a whiter, less diverse, more conservative UVA (even though it’s less diverse than most state schools already) and they do not care about anything else.

I’d been considering a donation in Jim’s honor designated for AccessUVA so students don’t get caught up in this situation and I can still send a message to the board.

I’m not standing with a guy that caved so easily to trump’s pressure.

Hey! This group is what you're looking for wahoos4uva.com 😉

It said what UVa should have done, not what Jim Ryan should have done.

The author is critical of the Board of Visitors and Attorney General Miyares, not President Ryan.

I don’t get it either cuz they go on to explain in the article why “what UVA should have done” probably wouldn’t have gone Jim’s way anyway

We’re not allowed to discuss that.

This is your brain on Fox News

Having a bit of trouble believing UVA accepted you as a student

In 23.1 of virginia code the governornis granted broad leeway to remove bov members for malfeasance or just not doing a satisfactory job. She could clean house but would need to reform how bov members are appointed and removed to prevent a shell game of removing board members every time thr governorship switches.

It can happen quickly, as the governor has the authority to remove board members for "malfeasance, misfeasance, incompetence, or gross neglect." This is why Governor Youngkin was able to remove Bert Ellis from the UVA Board of Visitors in March. I think that the best thing we can do for our university now is to organize protests against the board and work hard to elect Spanberger for governor and Jones for attorney general.

What you're also missing is I believe about 4-5 of the BOV are simply just interim and should not be on the board as their term expired but have potentially illegally overstayed their time since the state refused to approve Youngkins nominees. So currently the board is held hostage illegally by Youngkin.

Well apparently Youngkin set precedence when he fired some members of the BOV and replaced with his cronies.

Yes. Capitulation has been tried and is a failed strategy. Better to be like Harvard and have a fighting chance than get crushed like Columbia.

Yes, absolutely. Has capitulating to fascism ever worked - once?

You are right capitulation to a bully always works out.

If this wasn’t the time then there is never a time. The surest way to beat a bully is to give it right back to them.

I’m sure your ancestors worked hard to keep slaves too.

https://c-ville.com/public-record-community-reacts-heaphy-report/? it's tragic that even though it's only a few year since it happened that the facts of the unite the right rally are already fading from memory. some were covered up by the local media and the heaphy report charlottesville's city council and it's management (maurice jones) were completely incompetent and let a preventable disaster unfold resulting in the death of one person, physical and psychic injury to many other and lingering infamy for the city tim heaphy literally contacted his friend mike signer, whose political campaign he had been a donor to, the evening of the unite the right rally to offer his services heaphy's final report dumped the bulk of the blame on the city's african american police chief who then took the fall. he was rewarded for that by secretly being kept on the city's payroll for a year and a half after his faked resignation. (edit - to make it clear that police chief al thomas was the one kept on the city's payroll after faking a resignation) signer predictably escaped the report relatively unscathed. he managed to go on use his notoriety to further the self promotion he moved to charlottesville for in the first place

Ooh I would be OK with that.

The Trump admin was threatening to withhold student visas, cut student funding, and cut research funding among many other things. Ryan was between a rock and a hard place, especially without BOV backing. I can see how he felt he had to fall on the sword here.

Apparently! I like how I get downvoted! Lol. These ppl are huge losers.

It is certainly fair to criticize my brain...I sometimes do myself. But I assure you my views on UVA and the BOV come solely from watching livestreams of BOV meetings and relevant news articles. I glean nothing relevant from Fox News. Now, The View, that's another story!

They didn’t. He’s just a troll lol

The board of visitors already needs to be approved by the general assembly. Except for Cuccinelli, everyone was approved by the general assembly. I can guarantee that Spanberger will not alter this process.

Thankfully Youngkin removed Ellis but it didn't stop the rest of the jerks for allowing this to happen.

Who on the BOV has overstayed their term? I went through the entire list yesterday and didn't see anyone who is on past their term date. He named 4 new people to start tomorrow: [https://news.virginia.edu/content/gov-youngkin-appoints-four-new-members-uva-board-visitors](https://news.virginia.edu/content/gov-youngkin-appoints-four-new-members-uva-board-visitors) I don't know that the general assembly has approved them yet or not.

The only board member who Im aware of that Youngkin fired was Bert Ellis. Bert Ellis was his own appointee. He is a cofounder of the Jefferson Council, and one of the people at the center of the effort to remove Ryan. I suspect Youngkin removed him because he was TOO zealous and radical in his attempt to take down Ryan. I’m not aware of Youngkin firing any of Northam’s appointees.

Lol seeing this echo chamber not understand obama and biden enforcement of their principles were about as fascist as trump removing them. Activism within the administration of schools has no place in academic institutions of higher learning. Yall realize your president instituted discriminatory practices in just a different manner. Just drop out if you are so unhappy, many willing to take your place.

Damn almost was a perfect peel

lol love the “13 ft high” written on the panel behind the door handle

Whew, it’s like he got stuck and was like “fuck it” and kept driving.

Hey, give the poor guy a break. He thought he was going fast enough to phase through the bridge, particle-wave duality from Physics anyone?

May I always have the confidence of this driver.

You’ll like our style!

Edit: CASUALTY, RIP, I am sorry for the loss of life. How High..., but seriously thought HOW FAST... Barely scraping the bottom here.

A story as old as time .

"a woman with a past has no future" interesting quote right next to St A's Hall

Wow, this is absolutely beautiful. I challenge someone to make a modern version!

I have that map!!! My mom bought it for me at an antique store

Engineer used to have a club?

Imagine no chemistry building/gilmer and being able to see Scott Stadium from old dorms

Guess some faculty housing was torn down to make way for more e school. Wonder how that convo went down with those faculty...

?!? Where is Kerchoff

And no Eway?

I was going to ask a similar question. Does anyone have a photo of what that area looked like before all the new e school buildings? Interesting to see what certain buildings used to be. Never knew Peabody used to be the Education School. Also didn't know the Art History building used to be the Architecture School. Is the Biology building in this the Special Collections library? Was that building heavily remodeled or torn down?

Looks like it used to house the JAG school

Most of E Way wasn't built until the 70s.

Penn rejects compact https://www.thedp.com/article/2025/10/penn-rejects-white-house-compact Penn Pulitzer Prize-winning history professor Ben Nathans shared updated version of Benjamin Franklin’s "Join or Die" engraving from 1754 with universities swapped in for colonies: https://bsky.app/profile/tedmccormick.bsky.social/post/3m2z3aiapgk2i Nathans also wrote about the compact, well worth a read: https://www.thedp.com/article/2025/10/compact-response-from-faculty-say-no-disgrace

If an alum wanted to write in to encourage the rejection of this idiotic compact, what do we think the most effective path is? An email to the president? I basically plan to say that signing this would guarantee the school never gets a cent from me in donations.

C’mon UVA - the path is clear

If possible, show up for rally on Friday 10/17/25. "News conference at 11:15 a.m., followed by a rally starting at the Rotunda at noon. Participants will then march to Madison Hall to deliver a packet of statements against the compact to UVA interim President Paul Mahoney." Which suggests Mahoney is good email recipient. Thank you for caring! Wahoowa!

Sign the petition and pledge to withhold donations unless and until the school rejects the compact! https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/467e5392cbba4187aa66240725539c25b5584d44?hash=acf24f0e341aae9a31311f58b416ca0b Thank you for your solidarity🙏

I just got my 1819 solicitation. I’m calling today to say not a dime from me till you reject the compact.

does giving a bj count as eating and drinking for saliva screenings? like many people here I practice covid safe sex by using the glory holes here on grounds--and sometimes aim to kill two birds with one stone by giving a bj on the way to my weekly saliva screening. Do I still have to wait 30 minutes afterwards? What if I don't swallow? And most importantly, if it comes back negative does that mean that I'm and the persons dick that I sucked are we both negative? &#x200B; Asking for a friend. fyi

it's 7 in the morning

Say your lying? There aren’t any glory holes on grounds, are there? Also asking for a friend 😂

I mean I would say to wait 30 min as a precaution

Judging by the number of new cases among fraternity members after in-person rush, I would say no, it won't affect the test.

Damn you’re more thirsty than my roommate after they’ve eaten a box full of auntie Anne’s pretzels

There used to be!

Correct. All the glory holes are in the frat houses "strictly for house member use only," said a friend.

Oh f.....😂😂

Yeah that’s not how rush works (unfortunately)

WHATTT!! Thats crazy!

New Cabell Hall had some, so did Thornton. I'm sure those bathrooms have long since been renovated.

I'm not sure anything ever truly gets renovated in Thornton.

You'd be surprised. I have been a regular visitor to Grounds since circa 1992, long before I was a student. They have done a LOT with that area.

WTF I honestly think closing libraries and gyms is some of the evilest shit that UVA could do right now. For most of us, we can only really find meaning right now by studying/ working out and now even that is being taken away from us. It's just straight up insulting because we all fucking know what the (major) source is: Greek life. I know I got on this sub and tried to say something about ppl freaking out abt the Madbowl snowball situation, but holy shit seeing 10000 girls post pics of bid day and hearing about all these bid day parties (someone told me about a 200 person party).... I am infuriated... especially beecause Jim Ryan wouldn't even say the words "greek life" "ifc" or "frat" in the god damned email. Like, how hard is it actually to simply enforce covid regulations on fraternities?? Idk this rant is annoying but the solutions seem to be so simple, yet admin resorts to clearly ineffectual measures that will simply make students more depressed and tbh probably encourage people to go out. Everyone I am talking to is just extremely burned out from Zoom University and now we can't even step outside without feeling like a criminal because people thought 10 beers in a basement was worth it to blatently break guidelines. I just wish there was something I/ we could do to actually change something becuase feeling powerless sucks. The email yesterday was just really such a big slap in the face that I couldn't believe it. Esp knowing that Jim Ryan makes 700k/ year to say shit like this makes me sick to my stomach especially as a TA making $150/ week. Rant over

Here’s an explanation. I don’t think it’s complete but I think it gets you a long way. Usually the answer to “why is my college doing [thing I don’t like]” is insurance and legal liability. That’s going on here. If someone gets a severe case or dies of covid they/their parents very well may sue UVA because UVA has deep pockets. To successfully sue UVA (I.e. win a jury trial or get a settlement) the infected student would need to show that UVA had negligently done something that foreseeably *caused* the student’s injuries. So if they have a spike in cases and UVA *doesn’t* tighten restrictions, and then after that somebody (who was following all the rules/doing everything right themselves) gets sick at UVA’s gym or library, then they could maybe convince a jury that UVA caused this, and UVA would have to pay a bunch of money to make it go away. But if UVA shuts down the gyms and a student whose mental health was hanging by a thread subsequently harms themselves and *their* parents sue, then it’s significantly harder to prove that UVA caused it. The link there is way more attenuated because for example, the person was already depressed, maybe they had a history of this, and there’s a lot going on in the world right now besides UVA’s restrictions. And at any rate a jury/judge is gonna say it was “reasonable” for UVA to shut down in this way after a spike. So I agree. From a broader public health standpoint it makes little sense to close the gyms and libraries. They’re not major vehicles for transmission and a lot of people are leaning on them right now. But if your primary goal is to cover your ass, then you’d follow UVA’s playbook.

fuck greek life i need the gym to stay sane i feel u

take that $150 week and invest in doge coin and maybe you'll reach Jimmy's salary in a month

I totally agree. The only things keeping me on schedule were my gym trips and my work sessions in the library. It’s like admin thinks you’re more likely to get COVID behind socially distant plexiglass barriers at Clem instead of IFC rush.

HOLY FUCK BRUH I FEEL SO SORRY FOR YALL THE LIBRARY AND THE GYM IS WHERE I LIVE

The library and gym were my last places of sanity. If they’re closed and we’re still getting charged for them, is it safe to say I’m paying for the Greek life to continue their events?

Honestly, WHAT DOES CLOSING THE LIBRARY AND GYM DO when frats just party all the time? They won't go to the library and study, so why take away resources that are essential to other students!!

i just discovered that i function way better when i study in the library like two days before this happened and i was devastated because i do not be vibin as a first yr. I also am upset about the gyms because i am unhappy as heck shut up in my dorm with no physicla exertion

Unironically I'm down for a riot. I'm thinking we can grab some tiki torches to spruce it up.

Yeah, I totally agree. This latest shit has gotten me really back into antinatalist literature and re-evaluating the true nature of humanity and how we're all doomed from the start. Online classes are just a byproduct of our disintegrating environment (that us humans are the cause of), and in some sense I feel (at least the closest thing I can feel to) empathy towards those who choose to partake in "Greek life" (Although many ancient Greeks would likely subscribe to a more stoic mentality of not needing to pay large sums of money to make friends and that large gatherings during a mass pandemic is illogical), because they're just simply looking for a distraction in this world that promotes greed and evil. Jim Ryan and Dean Groves are simply cogs in the larger machine that promotes suffering at all costs and minimizes happiness. But yeah, it is pretty irksome I no longer can hold my weekly socially distanced Pynchon reading group because of these new rules.

You cannot exercise outdoors?

Fax. All that time mashing your thumbs on the keyboard, you could've started an LLC.

same lol might as well d*e

Ah yes, frat guys just party all the time and never study in the library. You sound ridiculous.

Yeah, like it went so well last time tiki torches marched on Grounds...

I, too am down for a riot

this post in and of itself was a damn Pynchon novel

i do primarily weight training, and the atmosphere and environment of a gym is also different and therapeutic for me. also we are about to get a big winter storm so exercising outside isn’t really an option haha

it’s annoying that the gyms are closed because I can do some hand weight exercises in my room, but I have cold induced asthma, so running outside isn’t an option unfortunately

It's below freezing dude.

Damn big daddy. So many haters on this excellent suggestion. Plyometrics motherfuckers. There goes my sinking karma with this comment.

What's with the sarcasm? We got a free concert.

Gotcha. Thankfully I have my gym stuff in the downstairs workshop so weights/dreadmill and rowing machine sorted. Hats off to my 65 year old wife, doing outdoor Orange Theory 3 times a week at 430PM, regardless of the temp. Maybe just buy some adjustable dumbbells? Key is to be able to get to the "sleeping well tonight" workout. Edit: Downtvotes hahahaha. Find a solution instead of bitching. You are UVa level people. Best and brightest. Do some pushups. Find a solution. Stop ensuring your elitist, privileged reputation in town.. like this thread.

My 65 year old wife did 45 minutes in the parking lot of Orange Theory tonight.

I’m not being sarcastic in the slightest, the last thing anyone should be joking about is August 11th/12th

>Thankfully I have my gym stuff in the downstairs workshop so weights/dreadmill and rowing machine sorted. Congrats, but we don't. >Orange Theory 3 times a week at 430PM, regardless of the temp. Lmao who cares, that's not weight training. >Maybe just buy some adjustable dumbbells? The point is to not spend money you clown.

Dude, I was totally set to offer up of my old Bowflex 1090s to borrow and allow the Honor code to get them back. I have plenty of back up free weights and drive into town daily. Burning bridges and potential contacts....not smart.

Not the results I expected tbh

This is Aladeen news

I’m so confused

I was trying so hard to understand this... why do I go to this school

Good meme lmao

Lmao i did post something similar at the discord too but you spacing is more convincing

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3BakHgvfdQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3BakHgvfdQ) The relevant segment starts at :40

What a gem how did I alaaden knew about it

Photo I took from my in-person lecture today. Feels weird.

That’s what an average theory of comp class looked like during normal school lmao

I had mine yesterday. Oh my gosh was that my most productive class in weeks.

Our largest classroom.

Wow. Last time I was in that room was 1994. It looks like they haven't changed a thing.

Looks pretty safe to me! And much better than living with mom and dad when you’re 19!

Ok but why would you go through the trouble of showing up in person to spend it on your phone (@that person to the right of the pic)

Omg I was about to say this

Right? I’ve honestly felt as if I’ve learned absolutely nothing since classes began. No notes, almost nothing retained, learning the bare minimum to do the homework. But in lecture today, I took two full pages of notes. It was refreshing. Who would’ve ever thought we’d miss taking notes?

I appreciate all the effort that went into tying five of every six every seats. Everyone wore masks, and it was (ironically) a breath of fresh air to get out of my room for once. Hopefully we can keep this up and under control!

I remember when Halo came out and we snuck in there and played it on the big screen. I’m dating myself.

Is it really? I thought the big lecture hall in Wilson was bigger.

Is this where I took Sabato's GFAP 101 in 1998?

To get out of the house bro

good ol times

Yep. We only have two "classrooms" on Grounds that fit more than 400 people...when all the seats can be used (Chem and McLeod's auditorium). Three fit 300-400 (Gilmer, Wilson, Maury). If we added in Newcomb spaces, the ballroom can fit over 400 and I believe the theater can fit something like 375. If anyone is curious, [here's the list of classroom spaces at UVA](https://classrooms.its.virginia.edu/list). You can sort by capacity.

We have the best law professors This was a pleasure to read. Wahoowa!

The Trump administration has ignored the rule of law, judicial rulings, and the Constitution. Trump has never met an agreement he wasn’t comfortable ignoring. Why would signing this Compact be at all meaningful, even if it had merit? Fuck TACO. Wahoowa.

Can u link to the letter? Would love to know who signed!

That's the thing about being known for decades of refusing to pay people what they are contractually entitled to, and bullying them with legal maneuvers and bankruptcy declarations as a business strategy. At some point people know *for sure* that your word means nothing, your signature on an agreement means nothing, and that they categorically cannot trust you. This was always a bad deal, for many reasons including but not limited to the ones noted by these law professors. But even if the terms of the "deal" were objectively "good" ---they're miles away from anything good, but for sake of argument, *if they were*---it would still be colossally stupid to put your trust in someone so clearly untrustworthy. That's the thing that boggles my mind about some of my relatives that turned out to be Trump supporters. I always knew they were racist, and I knew they were Republicans, but what I didn't realize is just how gullible they were. I would have expected them to smell a phony a mile away.

Any conspicuous missing names?

Paul Mahoney’s wife, Julia Mahoney is missing. This isn’t particularly surprising given they’re both conservative. Risa Goluboff (former Dean) is also missing but she usually doesn’t sign these sorts of things.

Paul Stephen - very disappointing as he seemed like a reasonable person years ago when I took his class. Also, back when Paul and Julia Mahoney first came to C'ville, she was quite liberal and constantly gave him grief for his overly conservative positions. It is likely that neither Paul nor Julia signed because of Paul's current position as interim president. Nonetheless, Paul did write the letter clearly rejecting the Compact. While I have not stayed in touch with Paul since graduating many years ago, he always struck me as someone who had the utmost respect for the rule of law. I cannot see him being a Trumper no matter how conservative his politics.

Just UVA students practicing to storm Area 51

Let’s roll!

UVA reports more than $60 million worth of research grants terminated

Because people will blame UVA, not Trump, for not following through on what they promised to do.

Absolutely heartbreaking. Catastrophic for US research, universities, that entire ecosystem. Particularly in biomedical fields. The return on investment for every $1 from NIH btw is $2.56. Entirely idiotic and stupid. America has always been the world’s science superpower. No longer, thanks to Trump. What a hate-filled despicable idiot. Curious if others are also planning on moving to Europe for grad school, research opportunities, etc. On the plus side, worm dude told us we all need to do our own research, so if any of y'all want to participate in a double-blind study, I'll be conducting one in my living room. /s

So shameful that one narcissist can do this. Don’t ever call this a democracy or country of laws. This highlights what a sham that is.

We’re waging war on science and renewable energy much to the delight of our global competitors.

Have you seen what most universities look like today? The facilities? It’s absurd. No one but themselves to blame

Serious question , what does a program for childcare in southwest Virginia have to do with uva? Based on the article “29News asked Glover if she could specify which programs and grants have been affected. She has not provided any additional information so far”

If only there was a separate, co-equal branch of government that had the Constitutional authority over spending … call your R congressional rep and complain that they have aren’t doing their job. They shouldn’t get paid since they’re not performing their jobs.

In your opinion, which part of the cancellations are good?

Indeed. Wholesale destruction of everything smart and good. Other countries are not so stupid. Who do they think is getting them to Mars? Not our defunded scientists, labs, agencies, universities. Elon promised us Mars by 2026, but so far only manages to blow things up. And no next gen scientists, with dismantled public schools and hobbled universities. On the NSF destruction requiring generations to recover: https://www.thebulwark.com/p/trump-science-cuts-will-be-felt-generations-innovation-discovery-nsf-foundation-marcia-mcnutt At least our food supply will be more exciting (will it or won't it have E. coli?). Water and air too (EPA guidelines have been discarded). And we get a parade! $100 million military parade for a dude who dodged military services five times. Coincidentally as many pencils Trump thinks every child and every student should have. No more than five.

Then how does pulling back on research funding help?

Serious question, how do you think scientific research is conducted?

UVA Wise is in Southwest Virginia, no?

What does the left foot have to do with the right foot? 🧐🤔

Such services at universities do dual duty in that students who are in early education programs can do work/study and faculty and staff can be supported with viable child care so that they are free to teach and conduct research. Attracting quality faculty requires that there by such amenities.

You can't be this dense.

UVA Health in general plays an outsized role in providing advanced healthcare to much of SW VA. The affiliation with academics has made it possible for a much more robust hospital system to exist in Charlottesville than local economics would ordinarily provide, and as such lots of patients travel hours from around the state to get seen there. Many of them are the ones benefiting from the experimental medical treatments funded by some of these grants. As for childcare services, early childhood development is a target area where negative social determinants including lack of access can be most detrimental to future health. It makes sense that an academic medical institution with a community health focus would have a vested interest in funding similar social programs.

I blame the people who hate everything Trump is doing, but also "didn't like Kamala". Morons. Played by the right.

Good point. Are these wise grants that were cancelled? The uva spokesperson declined to provide any details about what the grants were, and I’m not sure why

I don’t get it

Suppose I am.

No, I don’t, I’m asking. The uva spokesperson did not share any details about the grants that were affected. Maybe someone else knows. Not sure why it has to be a secret

Let us know what you find out.

Oh ok then. Case closed. Orange man bad

JUST GOT ACCEPTED AS A UVA TRANSFER I would like to thank Thomas Jefferson for waking up out of his coffin and handing me my acceptance letter. I've been counting down days for the past week to see this decision. Accepted to college of engineering and applied sciences (CS student). I want to know of the other transfer applicants on this sub, did you get accepted? I wanted to share the good news with everyone (though I'll still be taking a gap year).

That’s a good day.

I transferred too! It can be tough getting used to a new school, but there's nowhere I would rather have been :) Best of luck!

That was me. Welcome to the club. Work hard, don’t get discouraged, and take advantage of the opportunity.

I was a transfer albeit back in the day. Best thing that ever happened to me. Relish it, enjoy it, make the most of it. You worked hard and it showed.

Congrats on the acceptance! I also got in as a CS student at the College of Engineering and Applied Sciences. Didn't get a personal delivery from Thomas Jefferson, but it was still an awesome surprise.

I LOVE THOMAS JEFFERSON

what’s the financial aid like?

What was your grades and stats like? Where did you transfer from?

I got in too! I totally wasn’t expecting it. Congratulations!!

Just got into the UVA E-School as a transfer today, too! Congrats!

Were you an instate transfer or out of state?

Congrats!!!! You must've worked very hard and they saw that!! I got wait listed but I still have hope in sir Thomas Jefferson

WAHOOWA CONGRATULATIONS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

i didn’t get in and i’m taking it really hard rn

I feel like the world is crashing down. All my hard work was for nothing. Applied for CAS for transfer, out of state. 1560 SAT. 4.45 weighted HS GPA. 3.95 HS unweighted. 15 plus AP classes in HS. Exceptional recommendation from a counselor stating I was one of the best in her decade career. Multiple state/national awards, leadership positions, and internships in high school and college. But had one C from extenuating health circumstances which caused my first semester to be a 3.5 college GPA (rest all As) but I submitted my mid term that showed my second semester 4.0 college GPA and acceptance into prestigious research. Worked so hard on my essay talking about my passion about specific aspects of UVA like location and its research. All this just for a rejection. Not even a wait-list. I am shocked, horrified, and sad at this. I feel that no one will ever care and recognize my hard work. I feel absolutely hopeless for my remaining colleges. I have no idea why in the world UVA could have denied me (not even wait list). Is UVA really that competitive now?

I was waitlisted for McIntire. What should I do next?

i got waitlisted:(

Can you play basketball?

Still remember mine (although it only happened like two months ago)

Congrats to you too! I mean he can only be at one place at one time so I'm sure he's walking to you at this moment.

I believe you mean Mr. Jefferson

I love you too <3

I haven't gotten my financial aid information. I haven't deposited yet.

3.62 college GPA, but dual enrollment courses English courses in high school dropped my GPA a lot. Otherwise, I would have 3.8+ and I think that mattered. Mediocre ECs but great essays. Sorry can't say where I transferred from!

what were ur stats ?

Congrats to you too! I'm happy for you!

Congrats to you too!

I think that's a great idea! However, I wouldn't join since I'm taking a gap year, so I'd just feel left out.

Thank you! Sir Thomas Jefferson has let you down, but he won't let you down twice.

Awh man, I'm sorry to hear that. I would feel the same if I weren't accepted, I'm sure everything will work out in the end:)

Really sorry to hear that dude, truly. I didn’t get in out of hs or after I applied last year. It bothered me so I can imagine how you feel. Do you think you’ll apply again. I applied for the 3rd time and got in. Maybe 3rd time is the lucky charm?

I’m really sorry :( you have rock solid stats. I am assuming that you are out of state. UVA has legal requirements whereby VA residents do get preferential treatment due to the fact that a certain high percentage of students are legally required to be VA residents. Please don’t take this rejection to mean you will continue to be rejected. I’m sure you will get in to great schools!

I'm really sorry to here that. Honestly, as an accepted student, I'm only the shade of the applicant you are. Don't give up though. Apply elsewhere. You are a stellar applicant and will go on to do great things, regardless of whether it is at UVA.

i really feel this. i applied in high school for cas and was waitlisted. i had to do a guaranteed transfer program otherwise i definitely wouldnt be here rn. if it makes you feel better, its insanely competitive here and very hard to stand out with the size of the student body, so you will probably have better luck to have a strong application for grad school at whatever school youre at now.

Only thing you did wrong was not be from Virginia. And even then, UVA is a very competitive school. I just got into for 3rd year transfer after getting rejected twice and letting not getting into uva bother me for the last two years. Please don’t make the same mistake I did and beat yourself up over it. You are a better applicant than me and a lot of people I know, and I mean that 100% seriously. At the end of the day your ability will carry over which college you went to. You seem to be very high achieving and ambitious and will do good. Don’t be too hard and yourself and if you do plan on applying again next year, I’d be happy to answer any questions you may have.

hey! i just wanted to say that i can relate so much to this post; not sure what to do anymore and feeling extremely dejected but i know that we will definitely be successful in our futures

Check my pm

I am recognizing your hard work as you're writing this! At the end of the day, if you put in the work, the results will show but it may not be immediately obvious from a college acceptance.

hope you get off the waitlist but dont expect much to not be disappointed maybe? I hope for the best and hope you get in, it's in the admission committee's hands now.

i'm sorry:(

search UVA or Virginia in your email

I’m old (retired) and I remember getting into UVA Law like it was yesterday.

Haha, thanks! And yeah, I'm keeping my fingers crossed that he’s walking this way with a hefty financial aid package in his hands. Would make his visit a whole lot sweeter!

wait you have to deposit before you get an aid estimate? that’s crazy

i hope so. rn it’s either tech or another year at community college and idk if i could handle either. i don’t want to be four hours away and this past two semesters at community college have been miserable for me

Fun Fact That You Guys Probably Already Know I'm probably late, but I just found this out, and I was pretty surprised, but I just wanna let some of you UVA redditors know if you didn't know already. Reddit was developed by two UVA students (and a Stanford student). That's why reddit has an orange theme. It's also why the upvotes are orange, and the downvotes are blue, which are UVA's colors. I feel like I'm the only one mind-blown by this but it is what it is lol

There’s a plaque in Alderman library as you walk in on the right that shows where the idea for Reddit started. Though I had no idea about the color scheme!

Alexis Ohanian (one of the founders) actually gave the commencement speech for the class of 2021!

specifically the waffle house on 29 i heard

In that case, downvotes should be orange and maroon striped for tech colors instead of blue.

Smh. Theres a plaque in Alderman. Or was before the reno at least

Married to Serena Williams.

I don't go to UVA (yet?), so I didnt know lol

totally fair! i didnt know until I worked at Alderman Library where the plaque was😄

UVA first year student dies from meningitis [https://cvillerightnow.com/news/208802-uva-first-year-student-dies-from-meningitis/](https://cvillerightnow.com/news/208802-uva-first-year-student-dies-from-meningitis/)

RIP, just awful

I wish to express my sincere condolences to his family; this is a traumatic and tragic loss. To all the students who came to know him: please take time to talk. Please check in with each other, over break, and seek support.

My dad told me about high school crush’s fight with meningitis when we read the news. She was fine on Thursday, in the hospital on Friday, passed by Tuesday. This thing is no joke. RIP.

My heart goes out to his family and loved ones. I hope everyone is doing okay with the news of this tragic loss. This is the time for people to come together and support each other in our community. Best wishes and condolences to those who knew Nico. May his memory be a blessing.

Heartbreaking. The GoFundMe link isn't working for me. Anyone else?

“avoid sharing personal items such as cups and toothbrushes” - who shares toothbrushes? Ew.

Heartbreaking. 💔

Why has there been nothing said about this with the exception of a few articles with their only source being the Go Fund Me page? The University usually sends out an email when a student passes. I would think it would be especially important given it was through a contractible illness.

Please take this as an urge to vaccinate! Unless you have religious exemptions, political disputes are not worth your life. All of my prayers are with his family. This is devastating. Protect your own.

This must be absolutely heartbreaking for all who knew Nico.

I am so sorry. This is devastating for his family and friends.

He was vaccinated. It’s a tragic case.

Wow that’s terrible. How very sad. My sympathies to all who are affected

Trumps America

Please get vaccinated!

rare enough due to vaccinations, but currently its on the rise with the anti-vax movements.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-nico-ramosestebans-fight-for-recovery This one worked for me

I’ve been using your toothbrush for months

Many houses within the Greek system at UVA require sharing of cups as part of the "pledge" process. Among other unsafe things. Wish they would move to things like "random acts of kindness" to boost everyone. A rising tide lifts all ships. RIP to this young man and love and support to his family and friends.

They sent an email to both the academic and health system sides of UVA about the positive case and how to access prophylactic antibiotics if you were exposed.

how do you know?

Do you know it it was MenB?

Is this a vax you have to request or is this one we would’ve gotten as a kid?

Due to migrants who have almost None or 0 vaccines in their countries. And there’s way more of them here than anti-vaxxers. They weren’t checked for diseases either at the border

I was involved in his care. His father is a physician and his family is very medically literate. It was a very very hard case.

It's one that's generally required to enter college since it spreads easily in close quarters like dorms. If your vaccines were administered in Virginia most any pharmacy can look up your vaccine record and you can also request it online from the health department but it takes a couple days (and they call you to confirm).

All three of my kids got the vax before they came to UVa and W&M as required by the schools. Maybe there is an opt out? Terribly sad.

There are exemptions to the "requirement." And lack of nat'l attention is not, in fact, positive evidence that he was vaccinated.

They only require you to get ACWY to go to college, not the one for men b. I just got the meningitis B vaccine last week.

TELL US YOUR SUMMER PLANS! fuck off I don’t have any plans except to recover from these awful past two semesters

Why ted cruz?

lol this is the exact vibe I get from those emails

Omg MOOOD!!!

can we please bring more kinds of guns to r/UVA please please please

can we please not bring any kind of guns to r/UVA please please please

Didn't he go on vacation to Cancun while his state was going through worse times than usual? Maybe that's why

This is a meme photoshop job taken from Breaking Bad.

name checks out

Yeah but he’s not asking for our summer plans

I thought ted cruz is supposed to be us as in people are asking Cruz about his plans, but he tells people to F off and let him enjoy his vacation. Tbh, I'm not familiar with that meme template, so idk whose perspective the gun holder is supposed to be

lmao no reason in particular just a funny meme, Ted Cruz is a grimy guy and I get those same vibes w those emails

Oh idk maybe that seems like a bit of stretch I kinda assumed OP just stole the meme, woulda made more sense with Jim Ryan or something. Also it’s from breaking bad you should really go watch it edit: people must hate bb

What are your summer plans?

Just embarrassed myself in zoom class A few times a day, I like to put on some music and jam out and dance in my room. It just puts me in a better mood. I usually have my camera off during my calc class, but I turn it on in breakout rooms and turn it back off once the breakout rooms are over. Well apparently I forgot to turn off the camera this time, and I literally got up and started dancing to anaconda by Nicki Minaj in my room in the middle of class. I really hope no one saw. That was so fucking embarrassing. It doesn't help that I was wearing a t shirt and boxers. Oh well, at least my mic was off.

I love how this is tagged athletics lol

anaconda by nicki minaj?! please tell me you were twerking lmao

Username checks out

I said “Fuck me” on the mic when I saw my exam grade for another class.

this post alone has made me commit to uva for the fall, also are you single i will literally dance in calc with you

🫀 i know ur embarrassed, but i think that’s adorkable and i love it we’ve all gone pretty nuts, you’re in good company

Sometimes I vape obnoxiously into the camera while answering questions /s

i mean if i saw this in class i'd have a good laugh think it was amazing lol it's pretty relatable

Certainly dropped something

My stepdad accidentally went viral in a tiktok where someone made a one direction joke with their mic on during class and I can only imagine that felt the same 😩

Just a reminder

whyd u have to do me like that

OP who hurt you?

Someone finally said it. Ouch to y’all

Senate Democratic leader warns University of Virginia not to pick a new president ‘anytime soon’ [https://cvillerightnow.com/news/208802-senate-democratic-leader-warns-university-of-virginia-not-to-pick-a-new-president-anytime-soon/](https://cvillerightnow.com/news/208802-senate-democratic-leader-warns-university-of-virginia-not-to-pick-a-new-president-anytime-soon/)

The role of the Virginia attorney general is under-appreciated in this situation. In a functional system, UVA and/or the state of Virginia would be suing the Justice Department for recent actions. So, why is that not happening? The general counsel for UVA is appointed by the AG and serves at the pleasure of the AG. (That’s why UVA got a new general counsel in 2022.) If the AG (a politician) does not want to sue, then no lawsuit happens. If we are talking about reforming self governance at UVA, the conflict of interest in the UVA general counsel is at least as big as the other issues discussed in this article.

He probably wants them to pick John Brennan.

I mean, there is a governor election campaign going on. Can’t make an important new nomination during a campaign, right, Mitch? Oh never mind.

Yup. An outcome of this has to be that UVA is allowed to self-source representation. And it goes further to the BOV as well - the president should be authorized to seek counsel without BOV approval as well.

just privatize the fucking school already. if you want to be a globally prestigious university, staying chained to the whims of Virginia politics (inherently a conservative population, especially on a global scale) isn't doing you any favors.

I mean pick any Virginian and there’s a 50/50 chance they work for the CIA.

The bigger issue is the federal research funding. Even if private, that issue won't go away.

Or pinko for that matter

Yes but uva would be able to defend itself - the board wouldn't be made up of right-wing trump supporters and would actually represent the student and alumni base

Hmm... You should meet the rich alumni base. I'm not sure you'd like that outcome. Most of the current board are alumni for example.

I mean, it hasn't exactly worked out for the Ivies

I see that you graduated in 2002. UVA has changed alot since then. I would argue its a liberal school now (the students voted to divest from Israel). The old alumni are without a doubt very conservative but that changes with each newer generation

Agreed. I'm an alum and very right wing. Hopefully UVA gets rid of the woke crap. It's nauseating.

'89 CLAS here and we're the generation that built shanties on the lawn.

I don't think the students are very different to be honest. All the policies they're now trying to rescind have been in place long before I got there and Casteen never got targeted for it. Most of the alumni are probably fairly liberal leaning, but I don't think that extends to the older uber-wealthy alumni who graduated back in the pre-women era.

Why don’t you move on with your life and let UVA govern itself?

It's really not your school anymore, Grandpa.

UVA Board is governing itself, but Ryan stonewalled and refused to live up to the honor code amongst other things.

Lmao at these tears

Give me the exact provision in the honor code that Jim Ryan violated. Also, the board is appointed by the Governor, so not UVA

>Ryan stonewalled and refused to live up to the honor code amongst other things. What does this even mean?

Ha, I wish Ryan stonewalled. Instead he caved to trump like a coward.

Spoken like a true 12 year old

They’re just regurgitating propaganda they heard

I'm going out on a limb and guessing sometime who calls herself dixie mama probably isn't an expert on UVA's Honor Code.

And lose federal funding? That makes a ton of sense. Ryan didn’t do his job. The end.

Thanks for the daily health check reminder

51. Read this post in the middle of a discussion session

40, 41, and 42 really hit hard

Damn as an alum you all had it rough this past year.

can’t decide whether my fav is 43 or 50.

Started off CR/NC, got confident and thought maybe I'll change it, proceeded to get a bad test grade and cringe at my previous confidence.

You didn’t have to call me out with number 50 Edit: number 36 hits too

2. When it’s covidy outside everyday can be considered mental health daze

Seriously. And we thought construction that closed a few buildings was a downer. We were so lucky.

As a fourth year, I feel like college ended last March as I was preparing to leave for Spring Break I still remember that day, I had no idea what was coming; I was just happy to be going home for a week to relax with my family and friends from high school. Now, I feel like I'm stuck in young adulthood purgatory.

I’m thinking the same way. As much as I’ve enjoyed remote learning, I feel like we only got half of the college experience and we’ll never get it again

i feel you so hard...i randomly walk through grounds sometimes and i don’t even remember what it was like sometimes and that makes me SAD and so sad that i’ll never get to experience any of it again because we’ll be graduated and gone, really fucking sucks

Lol I transferred here fall 20 so I got 1.5 real uva semesters instead of my expected 4. Hey at least it cost just as much 🤡🤡

We all feel this way about our lives, I think. I went to DC for my Spring Break as a professor. Came back and my whole world changed.

Same. I’m living with my parents and while I’m thankful I’m safe and don’t have to worry about spending money, I haven’t grown as much as I would have liked. I transferred in fall of 2019 and was just starting to make friends, and then we got sent home:/

Same, I’m so disassociated with school now. Haven’t been back to UVA since last March either. No graduation either so nothing feels real

At least you didn’t have to pay full tuition or anything, oh wait

> As much as I’ve enjoyed remote learning I can't even say that much. I miss walking to class, and hanging out with my classmates and professors. I also really miss meeting new people.

I feel like a lot of people in our year are trying to do +1’s to extend their college stay

Same thing happened to me :(

This looks like a great way to pressure uva to open up Fall ‘21

I know. I’ve missed all of it too. I mean the part of being around family since I haven’t had moments like it in a long time

Lol I just emailed my advisor to ask if I can feasibly complete a Master's in a year

I love that I only get sick on weekends

Yeah. I get why, but it's kinda insane. Like how busses just stop at 10 PM.

Me, who takes a Flintstone's multi vitamin and never gets sick, "Weakness disgusts me."

also if theyre so worried about spreading covid and making ppl isolate maybe they should have free testing thats open on weekends

also i had to walk around on a broken foot last year for a weekend because student health was not open to give me a boot

If you’re so sick that you can’t wait for business hours, then you need to go to the ER.

That sucks! Sorry you had to deal with that :(

It's not an emergency, I just hate that I have to feel like shit for the weekend

ER isn't any better- went once with a 105 fever and they made me wait in the waiting area from 10 PM until 3 AM and checked on me only once in the entirety of it. Ultimately decided if I was going to just wait, I might as well lie down in my bed at home.

why did this get -38 downvotes. It wasn't even said in a passive-aggressive tone.

Time lapse from the top of Rice Hall

Shameful: University of Virginia agrees to Trump administration demands over admissions and hiring

“The United States may make such inquiries **as it deems necessary** to verify the accuracy of such certification \[...\] **Nothing in this Agreement prevents the United States**, during the pendency of this Agreement, **from conducting new compliance reviews or investigations or otherwise seeking information related to alleged violations** of Civil Rights Laws arising after the Effective Date.” "If at any time after the Effective Date, the United States i**n its sole discretion determines that UVA is making insufficient progress toward compliance** with the Civil Rights Laws, it will so notify UVA and **provide UVA with a period of 15 days to make appropriate progress.** If the United States **determines in its sole discretion after that time that UVA not made adequate progress**, the United States may **terminate this Agreement and may pursue enforcement actions, monetary fines, or grant or funding terminations as appropriate, and may resume all Investigations held in abeyance** during the pendency of this Agreement." There are no definitions provided for what *compliance*, *insufficient progress*, *adequate progress*, or *alleged violations* mean in this context. The DOJ reserves for itself the right to end this agreement at its sole discretion. There are no definitions or guidance for how alleged violations or lack of compliance are to be reported: who does the reporting? Are individual students, staff, or faculty expected to report their peers for alleged thought crimes, actions, beliefs, or speech that fail to conform to official federal policy? Is the negation of this deal and renewed investigations truly reliant on something as tenuous as snitching? What does UVA really get out of this “deal”? Current investigations are suspended, sure, but we receive no assurance that we won’t face, at the whim of the DOJ, new investigations. The DOJ holds all the cards in this so-called deal.

we are required by law to follow the Supreme Court decision. this is the best possible outcome as all we have to do is write a quarterly report about how we’re doing that instead of giving them millions of dollars. it’s objectively a win for UVA and calling it shameful is weird and kind of out of touch. really the only reason to even call it a deal is to help Trump save face, UVA hardly has to do anything.

Because negotiation with bullies always works out so well

Do not comply in advance. Appeasement never works.

Won’t be ever getting a dime of my money as an alum.

Whores for cash!

This establishes UVA as a straight mostly male whites only welcome school. Who else would apply knowing the university likely wont accept them for fear of violating their DOJ DEI agreements.

That is, unfortunately, correct. They didn't cave on Government Control #1, but they took this one to avoid the pain from the administration.

Top 10 law school on grounds and they agree to this crap. Truly unbelievable.

Trump is still complaining about elections HE WON. What’s the chance Trump and his DOJ will just forget UVA and move on.

Appeasement always works. Just ask Neville chamberlain.

Pathetic capitulation to un-American mob boss tactics.

Seems like a big nothing burger. Is there anything about what UVA has to do to comply, like kill specific programs or hit target racial ratios? It seems like the administration just writing down what it believes it is permitted to do and what it is currently doing and saying we'll do this again if we feel like it. I'd probably take that deal and get on with my life not violating the civil rights act.

This is the kind of consent decree that’s been used in the past for organizations who have continued to break the law. I don’t see anything unusual here. “Hey, you’ve been basing hiring and admissions off of skin color, you can’t do that, it’s like the clearly written law”

Racism is bad unless it’s against whites

This is great!

May your football team stay as bad as it always is for eternity. Joke school.

Thanks for putting out the actual text, this is super helpful and I think you're spot on. What UVA gets out of this deal is a hope that it will all be forgotten about and the DOJ will move on to other stuff. I think it's somewhat of a fool's hope, but I'm sure Mahoney is just thinking that this takes the heat off for now and maybe we just coast through. The problem is that the internal desire to "take the heat off" will likely mean that UVA will act in ways it otherwise wouldn't to appease this administration--namely reducing admissions of black students and other minorities and new rules that hurt our transgender students. Because, as you say, the DOJ may come screaming back in at any moment.

Just to be clear: isn’t that the status quo for every organization at all times? Any organization can always be investigated for breaking applicable law. I don’t like the strongarming by government, but I also don’t substantively disagree with every element of the compact. I just think universities should implement them on their own.

You realize that the DOJ could bring such an investigation at any time, regardless of whether we entered into this agreement, right? Also, you seem to be upset about the lack of standards guiding the discretion for whether DOJ should bring such an investigation. That problem - the issue with prosecutorial discretion - exists independent of the agreement, too

You think this is the end of it?

This. Basically, "you agree to follow the post-SFFA law. If we think you aren't following the law, we reserve the right.... to take the same enforcement action we could take against any other institutions we believe is not following the law." Seems like the main thing to complain about is that it might be \*spun\* by Trump admin as a "win", even if it is a nothingburger in reality.

>it’s objectively a win for UVA and calling it shameful is weird and kind of out of touch. really the only reason to even call it a deal is to help Trump save face, UVA hardly has to do anything. The agreement restores neither the funding nor the programs that were struck down, and every quarter, we will affirm that we are doing exactly what the DoJ wanted. We surrendered our core values as soon as we were told to do so. What exactly did we 'objectively win'?

The Trump administration demands go beyond current SC findings. And Trump is infamous for moving the goal posts in any deal making. The decision to agree may be a short term relief, it unless there is a new mindset controlling state and federal government r in the next few years, the University will become an unrecognizable propaganda machine for the far right in a decade.

Preventing trans people from using UVA bathrooms is "hardly anything"?

Exactly. TACO!!!

This will save me a weekend when college tour season comes around for my kids because f\*\*\* me if I'm paying for them to go to a school that sells out its supposed values so easily. I was so proud of my alma mater when Ryan was president and this is just the final straw. And I'm not a person who says this kind of stuff lightly.

That's why exactly why Jim Ryan got pushed out. Appeasing Hitler is exactly the point of this admin

Thomas Jefferson rolling in his grave rn

They think, like all the other institutions and businesses appeasing Hitler, that they can just ride this out for a couple years and then he'll be gone and they can go back to doing what they want. A very foolish assumption

Thank you, and yes: it very much feels like out of the frying pan and into the fire. Putting your head down and playing nice (with no binding assurances from the Feds, mind you!) *may* take the pressure off for now, but is not a long-term strategy. Mahoney should know better. U*nless* he is playing both sides. That's a separate yet related discussion, but I'm of the mind that while Mahoney agrees ideologically with the current administration, he can't fully hitch UVA to the Trump bandwagon for institutional reasons. (I have no concrete proof of this, but looking at Mahoney's scholarly research, his deep involvement with The Federalist Society, and his political donation records, I detect a pattern.)

The fact that prosecutorial discretion exists or that the DOJ's mandate is to prosecute is not really the point. The point is that the DOJ and other government agencies are punishing idealogical opponents and pushing conformity beyond their purview. This isn't the first time this has happened, and it will continue to happen, but that doesn't seem a reason to just sit back and take it.

The amount of people in this country in positions of authority in education, government, business, and law who think giving the Fascist Mouse a cookie will make him go away is incredible. Surely, Mouse-oullini won't come back for another!

It’s been astonishing to see this sub shrug off this decision, and I can’t tell if it’s ignorance or indifference.

Probably, since Jim Ryan is out the people in the admin who hate him don’t care that much anymore. And if they thought they could have gotten more out of us they would have. But even if it’s not over this is not anywhere close to “capitulation” and at the very least is a short term win.

Which part of the agreement has anything to do with that. Please cite the actual number/point from the document. This is completely separate from the compact.

You are in the wrong movie. This is not storming the beaches of Normandy in Saving Private Ryan. This is flying under the radar in Schindler’s List.

I think he is trying to get UVA through things, and yeah I think that means trying as best he can to "play it down the middle" until we have a settled Board and settled permanent president. I don't think anything bad that happens is so much his fault as it is of the Board (who started us down the whole road of capitulation), Youngkin/Miyares, and of course the combo circus ringleaders/circus performers who are in charge in D.C. I still think deal will, in the end, leave UVA in a worse place than if we lived in a sane world. Which, I get that we don't and that some kind of bad outcome will result no matter what, but I still refuse to lower my expectations \*completely\* into the gutter.

Oh, i thought we were discussing the significance of the words in the agreement. Nevermind

The amount of people who think they can spit in his face with impunity is appalling.

Because it's nothing at all compared to the Compact, or compared to the deals that other schools made that included a payoff to the federal government. UVA has agreed to self-report compliance with a SCOTUS decision that the university is legally required to comply with. Now, I hate that decision (and the SCOTUS majority) -- but we're bound to it, regardless. An agreement that we'll send a quarterly report card to the federal government, and they'll stay off our backs? Best possible real-world outcome. And, don't forget -- a future BOV or President could modify or rescind this agreement, if they so chose.

what do you think the alternative is lol. saying we’re not going to comply with a SCOTUS decision we’re legally required to comply with? Other schools literally had to pay hundreds of millions of dollars. This is pretty much nothing.

Who are you accusing of ignorance?

Do you know what’s not astonishing? Random Redditors believing they know more about the law or are better negotiators than Paul Mahoney and his team. This is an enormous win for UVa. Anyone Hoo can’t see that is just so blind with Trump rage they can’t process obvious information.

"Short term win" yes, that's the point. You can celebrate it as a "win" today, but giving in to bullies is never a plan for long term success.

Okay: Section 7 of the new agreement states UVA will follow the DOJ's June directive on what constitutes a violation of Title IX. That DOJ document (in Section C, part 1) states any school that lets trans people use the bathroom or play on a sports team other than the one aligned with their birth certificate will lose their funding. You have to read the documents that the agreement references to understand what it means.

Your last two points also go the other way--the federal government can declare UVA in violation and resume the "investigations" at any time. The DOJ is currently motivated by animus and is frankly a loose cannon, I don't know how anyone can really expect that the feds will call this a done deal and never come back to it. All it takes is a round of admissions that let in "too many" black students or a single complaint about a transgender student to blow this whole thing out of the water. I think that's a legitimate worry--that the university will very strictly self-police in legitimately bad ways to avoid anything getting into the report. Don't forget, UVA isn't making its own decision about what is and isn't allowed under the SCOTUS decision--it's promising to follow the feds' own guidance about what it means, which is of course slanted in one direction as far as they can possibly take it. UVA has given up its autonomy in that respect. This arrangement is far better than others in similar positions, but UVA is still on the hook and you can only hope and pray that it will be forgotten about. I wouldn't waste my breath trying to convince everyone else that they must be overreacting. It's pretty bad (but not worst-case-scenario) no matter what way you slice it.

USC rejects compact https://www.president.usc.edu/2025/10/16/update-from-interim-president-kim/

If UVA caves, I’ll be very disappointed

I believe, Dartmouth is the only private institution that has not rejected the offer. All the public institutions, including UVA, have yet to respond. Being public institution, UVA and others have more hoops to jump through and also need to tread carefully in their response - whether they accept it or reject it.

Half serious question, is there a deadline to this or can we just ignore it indefinitely?

We will reject it. But we might be the last of the nine. Which will be disappointing in its own way.

I’d bet it’s rejected but it’s uva so they’ll have a drawn out process just to upset everyone.

Fascinating, thank you. Same outcome, whether strong statement or simply not signing. Doing nothing is tight.

Oct 20 is the deadline for "targeted feedback," Nov 20 is the deadline to accept iirc

Strong statement is of course great! Turns out doing nothing is also fine: "[A]ll universities have to do now is do nothing—no accepting the compact, no counter-offers, nothing—and the government will be left with no more power to coerce and control the First Amendment-protected activities of major American universities than it has today." https://balkin.blogspot.com/2025/10/the-art-of-replacing-law-with-deal.html I spent two minutes digging into structure of MIT vs UVA, authority of general counsel, etc, omg the fine print, got bored so fast. Takeaway, we need a governor and state attorney general to protect UVA. **VOTE Y'ALL.** Where exactly to early vote: https://www.elections.virginia.gov/casting-a-ballot/early-voting-office-locations/

okay, well, I'd expect them to stall till after the governor's election at least.

This. They won’t want to get involved in the election one way or another, so will stall.

Does anybody else feel especially alive when they're at Wegmans? I felt God in that Wegmans yesterday.

The ABBA playlist truly makes it.

NGL kinda want to get a wegman's tramp stamp

It's a bit crowded for my tastes, but it does have better types of Daiya pizza, decent bread, and huge tubs of hummus. I brave it for those.

I really used to drive to wegmans and walk aimlessly around the aisles just to feel something back then...

I used to literally live there but it’s Soooo huge and soooo many ppl u might know I’m not nearly prepared to see that many humans and wait on those lines during pandemia

I’ve gone three times this week, once just for the exercise and vibes

When my girlfriend and I wanted to do something during study breaks for 30 minutes to an hour, we’d go to Wegman’s and just walk around every aisle wandering and talking. We usually wouldn’t even buy anything. It was so calming though idk

the bakery 😍

i went there yesterday and felt both alive and overstimulated but i just thought it was because i was high

y'all know you can just go at 11pm and there's no one there, right?

Alive when I enter, but my bank is account is dead when I leave.

Trader Joe’s >

Wegmans makes my (formerly) felonious fingers itch like fucking crazy *allegedly god bless Statute of Limitations

I shop Instacart so I feel alive all the time.

It’s designed to have a marketplace feel, so it can seem overstuffed with displays, but I wouldn’t change a thing about it. Long live Wegmans!

Can't blame you, those frozen tikka masala dinners are 🔥

y'all knoweth thee can just wend at 11pm and thither's nay one thither, right? *** ^(I am a bot and I swapp'd some of thy words with Shakespeare words.) Commands: `!ShakespeareInsult`, `!fordo`, `!optout`

Honestly it’s like the lotus hotel and casino in Percy Jackson feel like you never want to leave because there’s so much stuff in Wegmans...being a real geek rn hahaha

Ha ha, shoplifting is neat!

yup an essential component of any properly executed #adolesence

On my honor as a student I will wish you a Happy Single’s Awareness Day!

Anyone else do that uvadates thing, only get one match bc you were so 'unique' (there words not mine), and then hear nothing back from them :( ?

😉 hmu you can be my Honor Committee Representative

yeah same lol, I don't know why people sign up to get matches then instantly ghost without ever getting to know the other person but eh, I guess I didn't expect too much out of it

half the posts on here

Hey man that was me some time ago. Sometimes the best information comes directly from the students rather than official websites

Welcome to my life. :) I find that people ask me a lot of questions during my instagram q&a sessions that can be answered by reading our instructions, FAQs, etc. Sometimes, it helps to have the info delivered in a different format.

/r/UVA helps those who help themselves.

Agreed! It’s like asking a friend (hell, just posting up on Facebook or something even) for a restaurant recommendation over some random blog or yelp.

Happy cake day!
