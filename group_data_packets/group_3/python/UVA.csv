This isn't a crisis birthed in November 2024. This is a state of affairs that devolved every time a scared Jim Ryan-type called in riot cops to brutalize their own students for daring to oppose modern Nazism. So keep in mind that this battle over free speech rights is fundamentally tied to the issue of Palestinian activism and its treatment by the state and its institutions. To resolve this issue of free speech, at least, in any favorable manner, the root stresses have to be addressed. Right now, in this moment, that means Palestine and the reaction to its supporters by the state. The world's bifurcation grows clearer under pressure. Know what these sides mean, stand for, believe, and hope to achieve. Pick one, and do something for it.",2025-03-04 16:13:08,55

comment,President Ryan at today's demonstration 🧡💙,"Trump/Youngkin, via BOV pressured him to agree to dismantle DEI a couple of months ago. He could have stood up then, if it was indeed something he believed in, and said ""Sod off, I'm not going to be the agent of your malign agenda. I resign."" That might have indicated leadership worth rallying around. Instead, it is alleged, he did some things to give the appearance of compliance but without making the substantive changes the the BOV demanded. He wasn't fooling anybody, not even the mouth breathers at the Jefferson Council. Some DEI positions were renamed or rebranded but as of June 28th the college of arts and sciences website still listed a person with the title of associate Dean for DEI. Notwithstanding what might be very legitimate questions about the efficacy of those programs and the actions of the people charged with carrying them out, if these initiatives were important to Ryan he could have stayed and fought for them, for research funding, for a academic freedom, etc. The school would have rallies around those ideals.

He has long been very vocal in his criticism of the rise of anti-democratic political forces, and the Virginia GOP even called for an ethics investigation into him in 2021 because of his vocal opposition to President Trump and his attempts to overturn the results of the 2020 election. Also, the Center for Politics has done a lot to promote democracy and civic education, and, in the run up to the 2024 election, Dr. Sabato was very outspoken about the threat that a second Trump administration would pose to our democratic institutions.",2025-10-05 14:11:57,10

comment,University of Virginia students holding 'antifascist' 'flag burning' event to protest Trump order,"I mean, it is a flag burning barbecue protest based on the flyer. But the guys statement is so fire ____________________________________________________ In a statement, Wolff, who said he is a graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy, argued the flag burning was not an act of disrespect but a symbolic protest against what he described as Trump’s unlawful attempts to undermine democracy, chill dissent and overstep executive authority. ""The president does not get to say what the law is; that is solely the province of the judiciary,"" he said. ""He must be reminded that his political enemies are not military enemies, and that he cannot stop free speech, expression, and democracy,"" his statement continued. ""Many of us, including myself, signed the dotted line and agreed to fight for these ideals. The actions this president has taken, between deploying troops to ""war zone"" cities and planning to use the military against dissenters who he terms the ""enemy within"" are far more disrespectful to the sacrifices of current and former service members than any flag burning, which has long been settled as protected speech. The president does not get to overturn that precedent with an EO, and his attempts to intimidate dissenters and chill speech is disgraceful.

It made the many hours spent on this project worth it! Without further delay, here is the world zip file of what's constructed so far. The world file is on the current version of Minecraft Java Edition (1.16.5). The world is far from finished, but the plan is to eventually build all of Grounds along with some off-Grounds areas and convert the file into a server in the future for all to tour and enjoy!

I am not sure how the process works for people who use Apple OS systems as I don't use Apple OS personally. So far, the exterior areas currently constructed are the Rotunda, The Lawn (Pavilions I-IX and Pavilions II-X), West Range (Dining Hall, Lawn Rooms, and Hotels), the Chapel, Alderman Library, Clemons Library, Special Collections, Peabody Hall, Monroe Hall, Garrett Hall, Cocke Hall, Old Cabell Hall, New Cabell Hall, Rouss Hall, Bryan Hall, and McIntire Amphitheatre. I haven't been able to build many interiors for buildings other than the Rotunda unfortunately due to time constraints. I also have to add all the trees that occupy central Grounds at some point.

post,PRES. MAHONEY ANNOUNCES UVA REJECTS TRUMP COMPACT,"PRES. MAHONEY ANNOUNCES UVA REJECTS TRUMP COMPACT To the University of Virginia community: On Monday of last week, Rector Rachel Sheridan and I shared a message with the community regarding the proposed Compact for Academic Excellence in Higher Education. We were asked to provide comments on the proposal no later than October 20. Today, I sent the letter below to the Secretary of Education and to White House officials. The letter confirms our core values and commitments while expressing our view that federal research funding should be based on merit. I want to thank personally the Faculty Senate, Staff Senate, Student Council, and many other members of our community who expressed their opinions on the proposed Compact, through the online form we provided and other means. Your thoughtful feedback shows a profound care for the University and a strong commitment to its future. We will continue to work to strengthen free expression and free inquiry, protect academic freedom, ensure affordability , promote intellectual pluralism, and maintain institutional neutrality in an increasingly polarized world. I am grateful for your continued dedication to the University and I look forward to working with you on these vital projects. Paul Mahoney Interim President University of Virginia _ _ October 17, 2025 The United States Department of Education Washington, DC 20202 Dear Secretary McMahon, Ms. Mailman, and Mr. Haley, Thank you for your letter inviting comment on the proposed Compact for Academic Excellence in Higher Education. We wholeheartedly agree that “American higher education is the envy of the world.” We also agree with many of the principles outlined in the Compact, including a fair and unbiased admissions process, an affordable and academically rigorous education, a thriving marketplace of ideas, institutional neutrality, and equal treatment of students, faculty, and staff in all aspects of university operations. Indeed, the University of Virginia leads in several of these areas and is committed to continuous improvement in all of them. We seek no special treatment in exchange for our pursuit of those foundational goals. The integrity of science and other academic work requires merit-based assessment of research and scholarship. A contractual arrangement predicating assessment on anything other than merit will undermine the integrity of vital, sometimes lifesaving, research and further erode confidence in American higher education. Higher education faces significant challenges and has not always lived up to its highest ideals. We believe that the best path toward real and durable progress lies in an open and collaborative conversation. We look forward to working together to develop alternative, lasting approaches to improving higher education. Sincerely yours, Paul Mahoney Interim President University of Virginia",2025-10-17 16:39:05,815

post,Dean Ozment's abhorrent treatment of transfer students,"Dean Ozment's abhorrent treatment of transfer students I honestly have no idea how Dean Ozment is still employed as the transfer dean at this point. I have NEVER met a transfer student who did not experience condescending, classist, and passive-aggressive behavior from her. The stories I've heard, especially from students of color or students who do not come from money, range from absurd to abusive. During my transfer orientation, she literally made a student cry! Before we went in, the orientation leaders warned us that Dean Ozment was an unpleasant person (although they used... different wording), but I couldn't believe what I saw in person. Personally, I transferred from a community college and she refused to accept several classes, despite *all* of the registrars and several other deans assuring me that *they* thought the classes should have been accepted with no problem. Unfortunately, Dean Ozment had the final say. I emailed her asking her to please reconsider and attached an 18-page appeal detailing the courses and their overlap with existing UVA classes. **This woman literally responded, ""I would not be surprised if the community college you transferred from had different standards for what's acceptable.""** Ma'am???? I've generally tried to avoid her, but she just reached out again placing a hold on my account because I don't have enough credits earned (because she wouldn't let my classes transfer) and that I would need to take summer classes. Y'all... I am quite literally mid-summer session at an abroad UVA location. She said it's a precautionary measure and that she'll remove it when classes end and I pass. I have a 3.9 GPA ??? How do you guys survive her :')",2023-05-24 05:51:13,781
comment,Dean Ozment's abhorrent treatment of transfer students,"I hope this blows up in the UVA subreddit. Gave you an upvote.

comment,Dean Ozment's abhorrent treatment of transfer students,"I'm so sorry you're going through this. I've never met this person, but have been on the sub for several years, and this issue keeps coming up. Some thoughts for what might be done for the big picture (but not sure how it would help OP)... 1. If there is not a transfer student association or club, look into creating one. Become a resource for each other, and help each other navigate the transfer process - and help build the community and make the connections that it sounds like are lacking for transfers into UVA. 2. Set up a meeting with President Ryan. If he is not available, in the fall, go to one of his open houses as a group and talk to him about your concerns. 3. Get the student member of the Board of Visitors involved. He or she has a literal seat at the table to the governing body of the University, and can raise concerns from various groups of students. 4. Go to the Cavalier Daily and tell them about the issues - send them to this sub to search the history of complaints. Get them to investigate an ongoing problem here. 5. Get others who have had issues and go to both the ombudsman (as TraderJoeslove31 suggested) as well as her boss, the dean of the college, and the provost. The community college system in Virginia is very proud of and uses the guaranteed admission to 4-year schools as recruiting tool. I know many people who have taken that route. If this woman is belittling the hard work you do there, that needs to be known and addressed.

comment,Dean Ozment's abhorrent treatment of transfer students,"She was by far the worst administrator I had the displeasure of dealing with while at the University. She is incredibly unhelpful, and when I would reach out for help she would consistently act as if I was trying to pull a fast one on her rather than offer advice and help me. I ended up doing the Batten MPP 4+1 tract and in preliminary conversations with her she insured me that I would be able to walk at graduation (May 2022) even though I would need to take a class in the summer of 2022. Around April, she completely reneged on her promise and told me I would not be walking.

comment,Dean Ozment's abhorrent treatment of transfer students,I dealt with her in 2018/2017. She told me “you’re taking too many science classes” and made me drop a few classes I really wanted to take. I had a 3.8 GPA in environmental science at uva and came in with a 4.0 from a junior college. The major wasn’t rocket science and I showed her I never got anything below an A- in any math or science class. Still made me drop a couple classes in my last semester after doing well the previous year. She told me she didn’t want me to fail a couple of classes and make me miss my deadline. She has a background in music lol.,2023-05-25 23:05:20,5

I literally went over that with her three times to make sure that there was no ambiguity in what she was saying, that those credits would transfer. By the time they transferred I found only 4 credits transferred since I had maxed out the number of credits I could transfer.

comment,Dean Ozment's abhorrent treatment of transfer students,"hey i’m a little confused, there is usually a sheet that tells you what courses transfer from specific colleges… don’t know if this will help but i’ll share my personal story: i had a case where i needed a class transferred in that wasn’t included in the original credit-eval transfer, but i wasn’t entirely shocked because the course was brand new and had just been approved for transfer credit like a month before my final summer session began before transferring (meaning i had already been accepted to UVA for the approaching fall). when i was told that they could not find anything to validate this change in their records, i reached out to my former dean of engineering at my community college and she dug up the email correspondence between the officials at UVA and her showing it’s approval. that was the ONLY way i was able to get that credit approved. personally, i have had a heck of a struggle with this school with respect to personal problems. my father has cancer and ended up being in & out of hospital during the last month of classes. i tried to appeal to the dean for a late withdraw, and they told me that since nothing “unpredictable” happened after the withdrawal date, that they would not be helping me. so to anyone out there with a sick parent, make sure you can forecast exactly when they will get sicker! what a bunch of bs",2023-05-26 20:46:06,5

post,UVA could be next,"UVA could be next This is Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish student who had a legal student visa to study at Tufts university. She was a full bright scholarship who was getting her PhD. She was recently detained by ICE and sent from Massachusetts to a Louisiana ICE detention center. There is video evidence of what happened to her. In the video, several masked policeman grabbed her and forced her into a vehicle. For the next few hours until she reached Louisiana, her attorney was unable to locate her. They stated her visa was revoked because of “terrorist activities”. The terrorist activities in question? Last year she co-wrote an editorial for her school newspaper asking for peace for Palestinians. She wrote things such as “We affirm the equal dignity and humanity of all people” and she urged people to take a close look at the issue. I’ve seen people complain about these types of posts on this sub saying that if it happened at another university then why should we care? What does it have to do with UVA? Well firstly we don’t need to be a Tufts student or a Columbia student to care about these types of issues. We just need to be human. And secondly, we would have to be naive to think UVA is somehow untouchable. We need to stay aware and alert. We need to look out for those around us. Even if you believe that this issue is too big to tackle (which I mean come on, political majors are some of the most popular at UVA. Why back down now?? Practice what you preach!), at the very least what you can do is stand in solidarity. To show that UVA is a college that stands up against this type of bull crap. The only thing I would say be cautious about is voicing things if you’re an immigrant. Rumeysa was detained for writing an editorial.

But when you come to a new country, especially one as diverse and open as the U.S. you have a responsibility to adapt, learn, and live in harmony with others, not to dominate or divide. The U.S. isn't perfect, but it's held together by shared values, not just open borders. So if life in your home country was so much better, why leave?

Do you believe they deserve to be mistreated and deported for believing that Russia shouldn't be attacking Ukraine? Is it really just ideal to you for her to have to act like a perfect robot and agree with every single thing the US government believes in just because she's a guest here? Why do you believe it's unreasonable for her to be granted some basic protections such as freedom of speech? >The U.S. isn't perfect, but it's held together by shared values, not just open borders. Yeah and one of the most fundamental values of Americans is freedom, particularly freedom of speech. So when she's trying to fit into that value then why is it a problem? Be honest and say what you really mean. You don't want her to ""align with American values"" (Whatever those could mean). You want her to align with the Trump administration's values. Most Americans aren't even pro-israel. So if anything she fits American values quite well. Anyways, all of this is irrelevant anyway because all of this isn't even the main issue. The main issue in question should be a concern for all Americans regardless of where you stand on Palestine or Israel. The concern is that Rumeysa was not given due process. She was physically snatched off the streets by a group of masked people, and then sent all the way from Massachusetts to an ICE detention center in Louisiana. Nobody knew where she was or what happened to her. Even her attorney had no idea where she was. Don't you think it's scary that we're living in a country where all it takes for somebody to shove you in a car and ship you half way across the country without anybody knowing where you are is a vague claim that you engaged in ""terrorist activities"" without further elaboration?",2025-03-31 22:26:05,2

Trying to work through the lower end of the comments to understand if anyone's violated the community standards. (Though, still pretty encouraged by the comments at the top.) That said, I want to point something out; as before, when the political kettle started to bubble over, it was very important that we kept the discussions civil. Harassment, or insulting off-topic commenting was discouraged and removable. It still is. So, as you start to post comments directed at groups of people, consider that those groups of people may be on reddit, and part of this subreddit. Therefore, your messages intended to insult without promoting the spirit of debate are not welcomed, and will be warned/removed. Religion is a topic that is razer-sharp, which makes it especially perilous to monitor. But please, **please**, consider the individual that is the target of your comments. If you are trying to hurt him/her/them, **please reconsider, or if you have to express your thoughts, take it offline.** **We do not want to emulate the reported transgressions of XA by being a community of exclusion to people who had nothing but positive experiences at UVA, no matter what org they were in.** \----------------------------------------------------- (⊙＿⊙') \*rolls up sleeves\*",2020-11-20 09:32:22,1

comment,An Open Letter to Chi Alpha at UVA,"This reminds me of my experience with Young Life at VCU. Not nearly the same level of discrimination, but it made me feel pretty cruddy nonetheless. After going through a full semester of leadership training, I had my interview to become a leader and was basically told I wasn't popular/fun enough for the high school students I'd be leading. This was a punch in the gut. As a high schooler I had wished I had leaders who were more down to earth and approachable. The over-the-top energetic style works for many people, but some kids don't respond to that, and I was disappointed to learn that Young Life didn't care to cater to those people. This experience turned me off from the entire organization, and I haven't looked back since. It's no secret that these organizations can be cliquey. It's making Christianity seem exclusive, which it shouldn't be, and they really need to be better about this.

comment,An Open Letter to Chi Alpha at UVA,"I was active (and in leadership positions!) in a Christian fellowship for 2.5 years and was constantly trying to hide my bisexuality.

I know that phrase can have good intentions from many Christians, but it always made me feel so alienated and confused. This letter really resonated with me!

comment,An Open Letter to Chi Alpha at UVA,"I'm sorry for your experience. They should have given you a chance instead of immediately dismissing you. I'm also sorry to see all the people calling Chi Alpha a cult and toxic in this thread. I tried it out for a couple weeks and had a great and welcoming experience. I ended up deciding not to join, and they were very gracious about it. I know others who left Chi Alpha smoothly as well. I don't see anything wrong with them encouraging their members to not drink/practice abstinence if it's a part of their religious beliefs. One post in this thread is saying that women are discouraged from talking to men, which is definitely not true. Most friends groups I saw in Chi Alpha had both men and women. And even though I am not in Chi Alpha, I remain good friends with several of the people I met during my time there. I guess I'm just shocked to see how people had such different experiences with Chi Alpha from mine. I think it's fair to require a leader of your club to subscribe to your club's beliefs. If a Muslim organization doesn't want to allow a Christian to be their president, that seems completely fine to me. If the College Republicans don't want a member of the DSA to be their secretary, that also seems completely fine to me. If Chi Alpha believes that one shouldn't be in homosexual relationships, then they should be allowed to exclude those in homosexual relationships from being a leader. (On a side note, I would be very surprised if Chi Alpha did not ask a leader preaching Catholic doctrine to step down from their position. I would also be surprised if Alex was entirely kicked from the organization. Chi Alpha probably just didn't want him in a leadership position.) Where Chi Alpha failed in this situation is that they didn't give Alex a chance to repent or defend himself. According to his comment here, he wasn't even in the relationship when he was booted, which makes the organization's missteps even more egregious.",2020-11-19 17:08:34,-9

comment,An Open Letter to Chi Alpha at UVA,"To all of you calling for XA's head on a pike. You are the reason why half of this country is staunchly anti progressive. You progressivists do not want to be accepted or tolerated. You want to force others who fundamentally disagree to change their views and policies to align with your own. You are not asking for freedom, you are attempting to take other's freedom away. This LBTQ+ groupthink is like a cancer that is rapidly spreading and it commands that you must conform to it or be condemned.",2020-11-19 14:59:55,-87
comment,An Open Letter to Chi Alpha at UVA,"OP, just out of curiosity, were you forced to leave Chi Alpha completely or did they simply ask you to step down as a leader? From your letter, it sounds like they only wanted you to step down from a leadership role. Wouldn't it make sense that they want to be consistent in their Christian beliefs by having leaders that didn't engage in what they view as ""sinful"" behavior? &#x200B; Based on other comments, they seem pretty staunch in their beliefs to where they even frown upon premarital sex. I imagine if another leader of theirs engaged in heterosexual, premarital sex they would be forced to step down, too. NOT to say that you actually had sex with your previous partner (maybe you did, I don't know, but it doesn't matter), but, the point being, they're very strict in their beliefs. That doesn't mean they hate you because you're gay. They just don't see the act of engaging in the behavior as acceptable and congruent with God's laws. There is a difference. &#x200B; I don't know much about Chi Alpha. Maybe they are a super-strict, cult-like organization, and, if I was you, I wouldn't want to be a part of such a group in the first place. Why any LGBTQ+ person would want to be a part of something so strict is a bit beyond my understanding. I know there has to be other, more inclusive Christian groups out there, right? Also, your letter says you're a third-year. Is it also the third year you've been a member of Chi Alpha? Did you not already realize what kind of organization they were your first year or even your second year at UVA?",2020-11-19 20:32:19,-21
comment,An Open Letter to Chi Alpha at UVA,"Hi Alex, I’m a queer woman and one of my best friends told me what happened at UVA. Thankfully, I choose not to attend, but I have seen how ignorant and disgusting the majority of UVA students are in regards to all minorities...Dismissing and disregarding issues of race, sexuality, gender, etc to have 17th century values live rent free in their minds. I’m truly not surprised this happened but I am appalled anyone would support an act of blatant, illegal discrimination. I will happily use my contacts at the ACLU and the NAACP to have them disbanded immediately. They should not be affiliated with the university unless everyone wants to get sued here. You’re a brave young man and I commend you for your strength in the fact of adversity. God bless you Alex, you are loved always, and my inbox is always open.

Following a similar strategy that Mr. Miller’s America First Legal group has tried against student-run legal journals at Northwestern and New York University, the Justice Department asserted that The Harvard Law Review was discriminating against white, male authors. The student who had been reprimanded, Daniel Wasserman, was accused of violating the Law Review’s privacy policy by downloading copies of thousands of internal documents.

comment,I spent three nights capturing the Heart and Soul Nebulae over the Rotunda,"For the images of the sky, I use an equatorial mount which has finally tuned gears to track stars as the earth rotates, keeping them precisely in frame and countering the earth’s rotation. I set up this mount and using Polaris, align it precisely with the earth’s polar alignment. I then find a star in the field of view, and using a separate small camera attached to the main optical train track that star using a guiding program that will send commands to the mount to keep it centered during a long exposure. Usually I can keep my error margin less than 1 pixel over a ten minute exposure. I will then take many photos of the same section of the sky — 30 two minute exposures in the case of this photo, and then integrate them — stacking for noise reduction (ie with each successive image we have a better idea of what lightness value each pixel represents so less noise). Once I have these light frames, I will calibrate them with dark frames at the same exposure time and temperature to correct for hot pixels/noise and flat frames (a uniform light field) to correct for optical aberrations (dust motes, vignetting). For this photo I did that four times for each panel and then stitched them together in a mosaic that is astronomically accurate (ie it can be plate solved against star databases). The processing program I use is a dedicated astrophotography program called PixInsight. For the ground I used the same lens and a SonyA7rIII mirrorless camera, shooting landscape (the sky panels were in portrait orientation). I shot three panels to get the entire Rotunda, trees, and sky section and then constructed a mosaic of the ground in Photoshop. I merged the two together ensuring that the arc/second per pixel measurement was accurate for both (ie that the proportion of the nebula to the rotunda was correct for that focal length and distance).",2021-12-17 19:44:51,3

post,"Regardless of political opinion, today's events should make you mad","Regardless of political opinion, today's events should make you mad I want to start by saying I did not attend the protest. I don't have a strong opinion on the content of the protest right now. I do have a strong opinion about the university changing policies at will with total ignorance of the process. I'm sure that most students have been at the receiving end of the ""it's policy, nothing we can do"" line that comes from many administrators. There was no announcement that the policy was being changed. They just slyly swapped out the documents whenever they wanted. The number of times I have heard, ""Oh, well, that information is online,"" is astonishing. This is totally unacceptable behavior from an academic institution and a severe violation of trust. ""**Oh, but they can do whatever they want. It's their school.""** I'm not saying that I can't; I'm saying that I don't want it to be that way. I don't care if the school controls its policies and ignores any process. What I care about is being told that the policy is gospel and nothing can be done when that is clearly not the case. Someone can snap their fingers and solve pretty much any problem. The school can effectively gaslight anyone they want by having someone change a PDF somewhere and pretend that that's that. **What I want:** To be clear, I do not care that the school controls the policy. I care that they pretend they don't when it comes to situations where policy significantly impacts someone's life. With that in mind, the student body has a vested interest in demanding the following: 1. Getting an official statement regarding how policy changes are made and approved that accurately reflects how exactly the tent provisions were changed this morning 2. A statement regarding whether or not that policy is going to be enforced by the school 3. A statement outlining what responsibility the school has in communicating policy changes to the student body 4. An internal and public review of the events that led to the changing of the policy assessing whether the school's policies were violated, and a plan of accountability for involved parties Rules are not a convenience. They are a necessity. UVA's policies are not some plaything that can be flaunted to the student body at will while simultaneously being some impenetrable rule of law. All I want is consistency and accountability for where I will spend a significant portion of my life. Edit: Since this is getting some visibility I want to reiterate: I do not care what the policy actually is, I care that at 9AM the PDF that held the policy said one thing, and two hours later it said another. Changing that in such a secret way is *insane* behavior. How on earth are we supposed to trust official school regulations if they can just change like that? It could even be the case that the protestors were aware of what was required of them directly from administration and the PDF changing was just a followup on a previously made decision. I do not care. If the school is going to use their online resources as a source of truth, then there needs to be clarity on how it operates. The last thing I need in my life is to be gaslit on regulation if for some reason a policy regarding my degree changes.",2024-05-04 17:19:16,570
comment,"Regardless of political opinion, today's events should make you mad","I believe Channel 29 just issued an official statement, but….

comment,"Regardless of political opinion, today's events should make you mad","Question—not an argument against you—can anyone point to any information indicating that the rule which was purportedly changed at 9:54AM today was being used as a justification to clear out protestors? The way I see it, based on how the rule was written, if authorities said at any point something to the effect of “these tents have not been inspected and therefore cannot stand,” then the argument that the rule was changed to help justify dismantling the encampment is sound. And in that case, the policy change is a super heavy handed and frankly stupid move by the university. How did they not realize people would pick up on that? However, if not, then I think the fervor around the policy change is pretty misguided. It’s entirely possible that that provision was removed to reduce confusion (i.e. so that future demonstrators do not think a rule in a health and safety regulation gives them free range to erect and occupy tents in publicly used areas for an undetermined and/or undisclosed period of time). In that case, it’s also pretty obvious that the university considers itself within its rights to disperse demonstrators on grounds for any reason. At that point you have a different challenge altogether, pertaining to the first amendment rather than this policy change. In either case I 100% agree that transparency is absolutely necessary, especially with the recent news that the school won’t be releasing their report on the November 2022 shooter.

I do not care about if policy was changed or not. They students WERE nonviolent and were willing to be arrested (like anti war protestors currently are all the time in DC). But the police response was abusive and authoritarian (and oddly stronger than the torch brigade of outsiders who DID threaten students ). For context, as a UVa student in the 80s, there were shanties on the lawn protesting Apartheid. There was a lot of discussion about them but no police response like this…but that was largely before every police forces was not over militarized back then. Adults and politicians and administrators in this country need to take a long hard look at how they handle youth dissent (violently). It strikes me as authoritarian at best at fascist at worst.

From what I observed, the vast majority of protestors were peaceful and exercising their legal rights. Only a small number engaged in throwing objects at the police, and only after they had begun pushing them out of the camp. There were many legal observers present documenting the event, so if anything unlawful occurred from either side, I trust it was captured and will be addressed through proper channels. Seeing riot police steamroll other UVA students was not something I enjoyed. I had concerns about a couple specific officers - one who kept placing his hand on his firearm and another carrying a large pepper spray canister. But overall, I did not observe the police engaging in clear misconduct, and arrests were minimal. I would not characterize either party as having acted seriously out of order. My aim in posting was to document the events at the chapel. I respect that there are a lot of perspectives at play here, and I am giving mine as an observer.

The idea that colleges/universities can prostrate themselves before this admin and that'll save them isn't backed by basic reality, nor has history shown pre compliance being an effective measure against fascists and authoritarians. This all ignores the enormous resources at college/university disposal, and the integration these institutions have with their local economies and geographically disbursed alumni groups. These institutions have an enormous amount of power they could use, if they chose to. An organized coalition of higher education institutions could destroy this administration if they wanted to, but most higher education leaders aren't wired to fight. It is massively wrong to assume appeasement and otherwise keeping their mouths shut is the best way for higher education institutions to protect themselves because it won't, the trump administration will not leave them alone, its literally what this admin has already shown.

During halftime, me and some other band members attempted to meet up with members from UVA’s band. As we were waiting, two UVA fans walked over and got right in my friend’s face, yelling various derogatory things about VT. I got closer and attempted to intervene at which point they grabbed me, knocked my glasses to the ground, and threw my hat into a tree, where as far as I know it still is. They then attempted to do the same thing to another member of the band, breaking his sunglasses in the process and called him a slur.

I wish there was more to say, and I hope you and the rest of the MVs know that the CMB was thrilled to have you all there. (Thanks as well for waving to us before our show.)

post,The Incoming First-Year 'All Your Questions Answered Here!' MEGATHREAD,"The Incoming First-Year 'All Your Questions Answered Here!' MEGATHREAD I always see so many threads, every year, asking the same thing. So I figured I'd make one big thread for incoming first years to have the most common questions answered! My current fellow 'hoos, please feel free to add to what I've written or make some corrections! And of course, On my Honor as a Student, I have neither given nor received aid on this thread creation. *Pertaining to Academics:* * **How does UVA compare to high school?** Look, I'm going to be honest with you (I will not Lie, Cheat, or Steal). College is different. In some ways it's harder, and in some ways it's easier. Yes, you don't have your mom and dad hovering over you every minute of every day. No, that does not mean you should go crazy and party every day. High school was very structured. Everything was lain out for you neatly. You got up at x time every day and went to school, sat in your assigned seat, and asked to go to the bathroom. Not so in college. I had some days I woke up at 8 am and others at noon. I never ask to go to the bathroom in lecture (because nobody cares if you even show up to class) and everything is due at different times and different days. You will have some structure in the sense your classes are at consistent times - but that's where the similarities stop. Be open-minded. Also, please take showers. You won't believe the amount of stories I hear about people not showering bc Mom and Dad are no longer there to remind them. * **I took x# AP classes. Will this help me get A's at UVA?** Yes, and no. Everything here is a byproduct of what you put in. I took 5 AP classes in junior year and 7 AP classes in senior year. That prepared me a lot to enter a collegiate academic environment but UVA still threw challenges at me. Some things will be easier, like AP Chem helping me in Gen Chem 1 and 2. Some things are just totally foreign, like office hours. Take the experience you have and run with it, but realize it's not a failsafe. You will need to push yourself while here at UVA. * **How hard is it to maintain a 3.6, 3.7, 3.8+ GPA at UVA?** This isn't high school. College is unweighted, so no more walking out with 4.95 or 4.6 or whatever y'all ambled out of high school with (I myself graduated with a 5.2 I think??? which is ridiculous). You WILL be challenged here. If you haven't learned how to study, and just 'read your notes the night before' or 'watch a video and do two problems out of the book' before an exam, you've got a big storm coming. For a small percent of people, that works. But in college, you can't skate by. Be prepared to put in more effort than high school. As with anything, your grades are about what you put in. If you go to office hours, study a few days ahead of time, take good notes, and work lots of problems, you'll be smooth sailing. That being said, you could just be SOL with a bad professor. Do your research on sites like [thecourseforum.com](https://thecourseforum.com) and [ratemyprofessors.com](https://ratemyprofessors.com) to see who you want to take classes with. If you're interested in pre-med classes, PM me. * **I took AP Calc/Chem/Bio in high school! Do I really need to take MATH 1310, etc, at UVA?** I mean, it's up to you. I TA for and have taken MATH 1310 (applied calc 1) and I will say taking AP Calc AB and BC did not prepare me for its difficulty, and I see that with students now. Obviously if you want to take the credit and it's not major essential go for it! But if you took AP Bio in sophomore year and just REALLY want that BS in bio, I recommend you take the intro series again for a refresher. This is a very subjective piece of advice. This is how I feel, as someone who needs to eventually take the MCAT and did not have a super strong bio and chem foundation, even though I did well enough on AP exams. They helped alot and I am glad I took Chem in college to supplement for AP chem, because organic chem expects you to know a lot about MO theory and nucleophiles and electrophiles, etc, which AP Chem doesn't cover. Y'all have been warned but this is contentious. Anyone, feel free to correct me. * **I want to pick out classes right now. Where do I start?** Great! You've committed! Know what major you want? Or even kinda want? Because you should know your major prereqs NOW. Don't be the person stuck trying to apply to neuroscience and taking four prereqs that same semester because you didn't know that MATH 1310 and PSYC 2200 were requirements. Even if you have a slim idea, start thinking about it. **However! It is totally okay to not know right now. Nothing you do first semester can mess up your career goals, such as med school, and you have time.** Take a look at the course catalog on SIS or at Lou's list ( [https://louslist.org/](https://louslist.org/) ) to get more info. Oh, and btw: When the orientation people say pick 25 classes that you want to take to fulfill requirements, they mean it. The likelihood is you won't get into your top 5, or 10, or 15 classes. Be aware you might not take what you want exactly first semester - but that's okay! That's part of expanding your horizons! * **What curriculum should I take?** I recommend Traditional, but this is again highly subjective. Traditional is easiest for me as a premed to fulfill all my requirements without having to take unnecessary extraneous seminar courses. However, Forums curriculum has amazing topics for discussion and their classes are super engaging. New Curriculum has good content as well. If you have more questions, read this link: [https://gened.as.virginia.edu/new-college-curriculum](https://gened.as.virginia.edu/new-college-curriculum) EDIT: I have been told all first years are taking new college. If so, disregard this part * **I want to get into Comm, neuroscience/human biology/global public health, Batten, etc. How hard is that?** Again, a dose of honesty. Not everyone gets in. We can chance and chance you, but at the end of the day, that decision lies with the committee/professor. I recommend you go and talk to the director of that major sooner than later to find out exactly what it's about. Also, make friends with upper classmen in those majors. They have that lived experience and can guide you better. Remember, each class changes year to year. Always have a backup major in your arsenal, but don't let that keep you from reaching for your dreams/goals! Do your best, have a good GPA, have extracurriculars, etc, that match, and hope for the best. And read up on it. Go to your major/program website and figure out if it's for you and what the requirements are. * **Should I take a COLA/USEM course?** I did. I recommend it. It lets you get to know your advisor quite a bit and it's a good 1 credit course on an interesting topic. Mine was on the Rustic Fantasy. I've heard a bunch of topics like Game of Thrones and Harry Potter. Use this as an opportunity to expand your horizons! * **I am an Echols/Rodman Scholar. Is it worth it?** It's a nice boost, at least for Echols, but it's not like you're taking separate Honors classes, UVA doesn't believe in that. Echols/Rodman scholars get their own dorms and priority registration times, as well as some exclusive events and speakers. I believe Rodman also has additional work and projects in addition to the normal SEAS curriculum, someone, please correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe that's the case. It's a nice bonus but you will not have a separate college experience from the rest of us, if that matters to you. I think it's nice to have some integration with the normal community and the extra perks don't hurt! Also, as an Echols, you can design your own interdisciplinary major, which is awesome. EDIT: I have been told to add that this designation removes gen ed requirements as well. Sorry I forgot to add! * **I did not get Echols/Rodman. How can I get in?** Hey, me neither. You can apply, at least for Echols, in the summer before your second year. However, be aware that they take a very select few and there seems to be little rhyme or reason to it. You can have a worthwhile UVA experience without being Echols/Rodman! The 90-95% of us who are not Scholars are living proof of this - trust me, don't let this one thing preclude you from joining our amazing community! * **I am pre-med. Will going to UVA net me a worse GPA than going elsewhere?** I've found pre-med classes here to be pretty fair. Definitely there isn't grade inflation but there isn't grade deflation. If you put the work in, and you care about what you're learning, you will do well. Remember medical school is not just a formula of GPA + MCAT and there are other things that go into it. Work hard, keep your head on straight, and you will do fine. PM me if you've got more questions. * **How does my AP credit transfer to UVA?** You can check more info here: [https://college.as.virginia.edu/ap-credit](https://college.as.virginia.edu/ap-credit) . However, you won't really truly know until you see the information in your SIS account once that's assigned to you, you can see it. To see your AP credit, do this: go to your left hand sidebar and click the dropdown on academics. You should see either unofficial transcript or academic requirements. Both will tell you how much AP credit you have been rewarded. * **How is first-year advising at UVA?** Honestly, not great. Don't expect a lot. Do your own research and approach professors within your department of choice for better information. That's all I'll leave it add. Anyone, feel fre to add your thoughts. * **How can I get involved in research at UVA?** Great question! Research is such an amazing thing and I will say UVA is an exception amongst top schools and universities in the sense that professors are so here to help you get into research and get you into the lab alongside them. For me, I sent a lot of emails. I emailed like 26 professors and only got responses from a few, but by my Spring semester of my first year, I was able to get into a research lab I still currently remain in. Professors, even if they can't admit you to their lab, can help point you to others that do have room in their labs. Keep emailing, and keep working on it! Do not let silence get you down - you WILL find a lab if you are persistent! Also, research is available through work-study programs, which I know less about, but if you qualify, is another amazing way to get research. Also USOAR is a great option to apply to and find research, here is the link if you are interested: [https://undergraduateresearch.virginia.edu/our-opportunities/usoar](https://undergraduateresearch.virginia.edu/our-opportunities/usoar) TLDR: Don't give up! Keep on trying for research! * **I have heard a lot of scary things about the Honor system. Can you tell me more?** First and foremost, don't let it intimidate you. It might seem scary to read about it online, it might be scary to hear about it at the signing of the roll, but you shouldn't let it scare you! A small amount of the UVA population deal with Honor and an even smaller percent go to trial. You should be aware of it - it's the reason why you can leave your backpack in the hallway and nobody will touch it - we live in a Community of Trust where we all hold each other accountable. Just don't cheat, and then don't worry about it - Honor is not out there to get you. Make smart choices! Honor is a contentious topic. Not everyone will agree with me. People in the comments, feel free to disagree! More info for those interested: [https://honor.virginia.edu/](https://honor.virginia.edu/) * **How are professors at UVA?** In my experience, most are really willing to help you if you show that you care about the subject material and want to do well. In my time going to office hours, I have never had a professor belittle me or not care about what I was asking them. Of course, there are outliers. There are professors that are known for being butt-awful, and you will hear about them. Make sure to do your research on the course forum and rate my professor before you enroll in a class. Talk to friends/peers about what they think. Use the resources at your disposal. For the most part, I think professors are great and care a lot about their students, however, there are exceptions, as there are at any University. That being said, I think UVA has a great group of faculty that really care about you as a student and your future prospects! * **Is college hard?** Well yes, but no. In some ways it will be more challenging than others. I will say with certainty that it gets easier over time, and generally that the first semester of first year is most challenging. Obviously, this isn't an ironclad rule that applies to everyone, but this is something I generally see as a trend. It will be tough first semester. For many of you, it's the first time you've left home for an extended period of time, or had to live with a roommate. You will feel like you don't have friends (everyone feels this way at some point, if they say otherwise, 99% chance they're lying!) and that you are alone at college. There are moments where you'll sit up and be like ""shit, I feel like I'm failing!"" Those feelings are normal. Every first year goes through them, and most of the time, by second semester, you will have found your place morseo here at UVA. However, that isn't always the case for everyone. Some people take it easier, some people take it harder. Know you aren't alone. Every social and academic struggle is not unique to you, and I encourage you to reach out. Reach out to your RA, your professor, your roommate, your mom/dad, home friends, CAPS. College is different. It's going to feel different. Embrace that difference, and seek help if you need it. &#x200B; *Pertaining to Residence Life / Student Life:* * **Can I pick what dorm I live in first year?** No, not how it works. If you have disability needs, please let SDAC know immediately so they can accommodate you. I promise you that whatever dorm you get, you're gonna have a unique and amazing experience. :) You can pick your roommate though! * **How do I find a roommate? Should I live with someone I know or someone random?** Lots of ways! You can room with friends from high school (but I suggest not to, you want to meet new people!), go random, or meet someone on your class facebook page. I met my roommate there. I recommend getting out of your comfort zone and meeting some new, amazing people! Know always that living with a stranger can have its pros and cons. Who knows? You could meet your best friend! (But don't feel bad if you and your roommate don't click, that happens more often than not) * **How are RA's here at UVA?** I mean, I am an RA, so I am a little biased... But i will say every RA I know, even when I wasn't one, is super duper nice! They are there for you, not to bust you or to write you up. Don't be scared! Approach them, be their friend (we love that). We are resources for you. Text us, call us, vent at us - that's what we are here for. We love working with residents, especially in guiding our first year ones! Also, don't drink in dorms. That's pretty easy, right? * **I got assigned to Gooch/Dillard, and I am bummed. How is living there?** I see this. Every. year. Look, I lived in Dillard two years in a row. It really is NOT as bad as you think, I promise. There are THREE bus stops that serve that area, and a dining hall right there. Is it far? Yes. You get used to it. It's not that much of an inconvenience and you stop noticing it after a while. Also, the suite style living is much better when it comes to the bathroom situation - instead of 45 guys/girls you're sharing it with, it's 5 or 6 others. Similarly, the rooms are bigger and the heat and air are perfect. You get your own common room and get to bond with your suitemates. Sure, you'll walk a little farther and climb a few more stairs but your thighs will look great and you'll have the best first year dorm experience (IMO), too. (the only big downside is that you don't really get to bond with your hall in the same way. But you get your suitemates. Could be worse.) * **How do I become an RA at UVA?** Amazing question! There will be info sessions later into Fall semester and the application process will begin in the Spring. I wouldn't worry about it too much right now but definitely talk to your RA about it you are interested! * **I am not much of a partier and heard a lot of UVA students are involved in Greek life. How does that work?** Look, me neither. All I can say is that in my personal experience, you don't need to party or do Greek life to make friends and have fun. Most people I know are not involved in Greek life and those that are are usually not super in your face about it. That being said, i know people who have done Greek like and really enjoyed it and made lasting friends, it's not all just partying and drinking. There are also service and pre-professional fraternities. It's all about what you personally want and who you click with here at UVA. Also, remember UVA is a big place. Your first year pals pressuring you into doing something you're not comfortable with? UVA is a big place. Let your roots grow and spread and find people who you truly care about you! * **Is it easy to maintain a good work/life balance at UVA?** UVA to me is defined by its work-hard, play-hard atmosphere. People here are definitely go-getters but know how to throw down when the day is done. Again, this all boils down to what you want. Taking harder majors, like Biochem, or harder career paths, like pre-comm or pre-med, will inevitably lead to a higher workload than others. That was me, a pre-med declaring a pretty requirement stacked major. That being said, I found time to work, TA, do things I like, and hang out with my friends. Some weekends I had to skip movie nights, and sometimes I studied so much I felt like I was going crazy. However, it comes in waves of exams and you will have time to hang out. I still hangout and facetime with my friends from UVA now even though we're separated by the pandemic! Just set goals, manage time, and even the toughest majors can have thriving social lives :) * **How are UVA libraries?** I like them. We have a lot more than say, Virginia Tech, meaning you have a lot of different spaces to study. My favorite place used to be Alderman stacks (but will likely not study there again in my time at UVA, big sad). Clem is also really nice and recently renovated, with lots of clean seating and outlets. However, it can be a little crowded at times, especially on Sundays and during finals, so keep that in mind (cleanest bathroom is on the 3rd floor, don't @ me). Public Health Sciences is also nice but it's hard to enter if you don't have a medical ID, so keep that in mind. Clark is...meh. People are gonna fight me on this but it's always really crowded and the bathrooms are filthy (at least for women). There are a few others I'm forgetting, and some smaller, major-specific libraries, but I believe I've hit the big ones. Let me know if I missed something. * **How can I get involved at UVA?** Great question! Go to the activities fair in Fall semester. There are so many clubs and orgs, and sign up, sign up - there are so many great things! Also, don't worry if you don't get into a club - many, like Guides or Honor, have applications and are tough to get into, and people often get hung up on that. There are so many other fun things to do that don't require an application. There's things like anime club, and club water polo, and so damn many singing groups, and so so much more. There is a niche for you here, I promise promise, and you should look for it! Talk to people, pay attention to flyers, go to RA's events, and read your emails. Activities fair is the best place to start! (You can also DM me for recs, I do way too much here) * **I am pre-med/pre-law/pre-Comm, etc. I want to get involved with clinical volunteering, campaigning, pre-professional activities. Is UVA good for this? How do I do it?** Yes, and no. Some things, especially pre-professional programs, are harder to get into due to sheer volume of interest. THAT BEING SAID. I did it first year, and so did countless others. Do things ON TIME, do not delay, and make sure you are reaching out to the right people. Joining pre-professional groups like AMSA that don't have membership caps and going to the activities fair are both great ways to find these opportunities for you. * **Can I have a car at UVA as a first-year?** No. Unless you have special circumstances, but like really, really special circumstances. Call Parking and Transportation to find out. But overwhelmingly no. Most first years don't. It's nice because it forces you to adjust and you can't run home too too much. * **I've never been away from home before and I'm scared. What is support like at UVA?** That's okay to feel that. Everybody feels that way. If they say they're not scared of at least one thing, then they're lying. This is the most common feeling among first years. Please go to your RA. They are amazing and here for you. Talk to them. share with them. There is also mental health services for free - CAPs, as an example, or the women's center. Do not hold in your struggles. Also, build a support network. Call home once in a while, stay in touch with your friends with home, and make sure that your network is there. That is so important to fall back on, and whether you're calling twice a day or twice a month, keep these people in your pocket - you'll need them all through college! * **What is the best way to make friends at UVA?** Join orgs! Go to events! Get out of your room! Get as involved as you can in things you like. Talk to people in your classes. Honestly, the biggest way I made friends was just putting myself out there. I know it sounds hard but once you do it it starts getting easier! Just don't sit at your desk all day and wonder why friends don't fall into your lap. Go out and meet people! Also, go your RA's hall events. It's a great way to know the people on your hall, who can become a huge group of friends. Don't limit yourself! * **How does dining work at UVA?** All first-years have to buy an unlimited swipe meal plan - so you can eat at the dining halls as many times a day you like! It's all you can eat too. You also get plus dollars, which can be spent at convenience stores and at food trucks. These are limited however so pay attention to them! You can also get take out a few times a day (not unlimited) from dining halls and use meal swipes after 4:30 at the pav to get subway, chick-fil-a, five guys, and sushi. There are also starbucks and Einstein Bro's among a few other options. You won't be hungry here! * **How is the food at UVA?** I've been pretty vocal at my dislike and lack of vegetarian options, but in reality, it's okay. It's definitely edible and there are some good days. Don't expect gourmet food, but it's not inedible. You get what you get and it pushes you through first year. DO: use your swipes at the Pav to get chick fil A on a meal swipe! Do also use plus dollars at the amazing food trucks (Indian, dumplings, mexican, and middle eastern - all incredible). DON'T eat the chicken at O'hill. * **How does the bus system work?** The buses are actually really really nice. There are many, many routes - too many to name here, but popular first year routes are the inner loop, the outer loop, the northline, and the trolley. You can download the Charlottesville area transit app and the rider app to see when/where the buses are running! *Pertaining to Admission/Transfer* * **I really want to go to UVA. Chance me.** Hey, really sorry, but we don't sit in the admissions office. None of us on reddit can give you a 100% chance. Not even u/uvadeanj, and she WORKS in the admissions office. Make sure your application is strong in academics and writing, and do what you're passionate about. Try your best on your SAT! Yes, we will happily share our own experiences with you if you want us to chance you, but we cannot guarantee what the outcome is! * **I want to transfer to UVA. Chance me.** Same as above. Classes vary from year to year in how many UVA can take and sometimes they can't take everyone, even if you are amazing and super qualified! Don't let that get you down and always try! Know you are always welcome here at UVA! * **I have a 1530, 1480, 1390, 1370, 1000, so on and so forth SAT and a 3.9, 3.8, 3.7, etc weighted/unweighted GPA. Will I get in?** Again, these are such variable measures we really can't assist you. What one person says got them in may have gotten someone else rejected. You are more than just a number and admissions recognizes that when they consider your app holistically. Obviously do the best you can do but know that GPA and SAT alone are not good litmus tests for admission! * **I got waitlisted/deferred/whatever they call it these days. What are my chances????** Again, this is a 'we don't know' question. Honestly, admissions probably doesn't know themselves. It depends on the pool of applicants, how many accepted folks take their spots, etc. I can only say don't be discouraged and don't let that deter you from accepting your spot should you be offered one at UVA! * **Where can I go to find more information about admission?** Here ya go: [https://admission.virginia.edu/](https://admission.virginia.edu/) [http://uvaapplication.blogspot.com/](http://uvaapplication.blogspot.com/) <---- this one is really helpful. Got me through my process. &#x200B; *Pertaining to the UVA community:* * **I'm an LGBTQ+ student and I am worried about fitting in here at UVA. Thoughts?** I personally am not an LGBTQ+ student, so anyone who is, fill in any gaps I leave out, but from what I've seen, the LGBTQ center is downright awesome (and brand new) and people are pretty supportive and accepting! UVA is top 10 in the nation for being LGBTQ+ friendly as well. Here's the article if you are interested! [https://news.virginia.edu/content/uva-ranked-7th-most-welcoming-school-lgbtq-students-nation](https://news.virginia.edu/content/uva-ranked-7th-most-welcoming-school-lgbtq-students-nation) * **I am a transfer student and am wondering how people feel about us.** Honestly, in my experience, people don't care. They're interested in knowing where you came from and are pretty friendly. I have quite a few friends who are transfer students and they mesh pretty well. I will say that your first semester will be hard as you find your place, especially as you don't have the benefit of a first-year RA or a first-year hall. Keep in mind you will have to go extra lengths to get involved but once you do you will find your place here. Nobody judges you for being a transfer student (in my experience) and I hope you find your home here! * **I am a conservative/liberal/moderate/libertarian/communist etc and I am worried about my political views being stifled at UVA.** There's both left and right here at UVA. UVA is a green light free speech campus ( [https://www.thefire.org/schools/university-of-virginia/](https://www.thefire.org/schools/university-of-virginia/) ) bound by the first amendment. Of course, that being said, you should always be ready to accept the consequences of what you say. There are many groups centered around politics and you will definitely find your party here! Lots of campaigning and party work goes on here and it's amazing to see how politically involved the students are. :) * **I've heard UVA is super elitist and preppy. Is this true? I'm worried I won't fit in!** There is always some truth to an accusation, I will be honest. That being said, while there can be some preppy culture, UVA is such a big school that you can surround yourself with folks to your liking. It's not something that has bothered me at all in my time here but to each their own. If this is a concern I would tour the Grounds first to see what you get the vibe of! * **What's the area around UVA like?** So UVA is unique that it is integrated into the city of Charlottesville. Unlike VT, where Blacksburg is literally VT, there is a charlottesville outside of UVA. There are pros and cons to it. You get amazing areas like the downtown mall and lots of conveniences like Walmart and many restaurants pretty close to you. However, there are some dangerous parts of charlottesville and you should be aware of them. Be safe, be smart, and make good decisions, and you should be fine. Remember there are resources for you! * **What's the Corner? What's there?** So the corner is our mini downtown area right off of Grounds. It's right by the medical center, and it's got so much amazing food there. There's the dumpling place, starbucks, grit, a CVS, Asado's, a few convenience stores, Christian's pizzas, a few student bars (Boylan, Trin, etc), and so much more. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED CORNER TRIES: Root's (holy sh\*t so good), Asado's, Bodo's bagels (incredible, cannot be in charlottesville without eating), and Take it away sandwich shop. * **What resources are there for me when it comes to mental health?** There's a lot that has been mentioned, but what comes to mind is CAPS and the Women's Center (you do not have to identify as a woman to use this resource). All confidential and free for student services. I have included the links below for your perusal! CAPS: [https://www.studenthealth.virginia.edu/caps](https://www.studenthealth.virginia.edu/caps) Women's Center: [https://womenscenter.virginia.edu/](https://womenscenter.virginia.edu/) * **How is Student Health?** Umm... It's okay. Good for a PCP but nothing spectacular (however, the doctors and nurses are always very nice and professional so please be nice to them). The medicine in the pharmacy is dirt cheap so it's really good to get your Rx's done here! * **What resources do I have to ensure my safety on Grounds?** Saferide is the best one. After a certain time, you can call for a free ride to take you home, even if you're drunk and alone. Here's the link: [https://parking.virginia.edu/saferide](https://parking.virginia.edu/saferide) . Similarly, there are other resources. Your RA will go into them. I have always felt Grounds have been safe(r), just because there are always students walking, even late a night. Buses run really late as well. &#x200B; *Pertaining to miscellaneous items:* * **How is the Wifi in dorms/Grounds? How can I connect my devices?** Wifi here is actually pretty good IMO. It's better than what I have at home. Connect to 'wahoo' the hidden network (instructions here: [https://virginia.service-now.com/its?id=itsweb\_kb\_article&sys\_id=ca13d12bdb8153404f32fb671d961969](https://virginia.service-now.com/its?id=itsweb_kb_article&sys_id=ca13d12bdb8153404f32fb671d961969) ) or connect to eduroam. Your orientation leaders and RA's will help you set up your wifi and make sure you are comfortable with all the networks UVA has to offer! * **Do we REALLY have to use all this stuffy lingo like 'Grounds' and 'first-year' and 'second-year'? All my VT friends call me extra!!** Yeah, you do. Thomas Jefferson said so, because learning is a lifelong experience. Sorry your VT friends are jealous they don't have this depth of tradition :( * **Are Days on the Lawn worth attending?** I personally didn't attend but I encourage anyone who is even remotely considering UVA to go. It's a great experience, you get to shadow classes and see the energy and spirit that really defines UVA. If you can't go, at least try to get a tour or do a virtual tour. Believe me, it's worth every minute and really defined why I wanted to go to UVA. That's my two cents. * **Should I listen to my orientation leader when they say don't take biology and chemistry together in one semester?** Yeah, no. As somebody who has lived this personally, and have had residents and friends live this personally, DO NOT heed this advice. You do not want to pair biology and organic chemistry in your second year because it's not a pleasant experience. For some, splitting it may be better, but for the vast majority, all it does is either a. put you behind by forcing you to take orgo in your 3rd year and make you take biochem in your fourth if you're pre-med, or b. make you take a crushing year of double bio and orgo. I did it for one semester, and it was bum. Don't do it. Toughing it out first year is a much better option, I promise! * **Are UVA the National Champions back-to-back, two years in a row, for 2019 AND 2020, in men's basketball?** Yes. If you keep asking silly questions like this we might have to rescind your admission! /s &#x200B; This write-up took me two weeks to complete. Again, much is opinion-based. Mods, if you find this helpful, I would appreciate a pin so that first-years can easily find it. Thanks for reading and happy trails, 'hoos!",2020-04-02 20:50:19,461

comment,The Incoming First-Year 'All Your Questions Answered Here!' MEGATHREAD,"Man, CAPS is garbage. They thought I was an out of state student lmfao when every address I gave them was clearly a Virginia one. Don’t leave your expensive things out and unattended for a long period of time because you think “honor” will protect you. Trusting thousands of people you don’t know is silly. And hot take but I don’t get why some people think UVA is special because of honor or whatever. People here probably don’t steal very often because this school is full of well off people and it’s not wise to steal something in full view of other people. UVA is very white and preppy. I have always thought this school has a problem with diversity and is pretty tone deaf when it comes to handling things involving minority groups and multiculturalism. If you don’t care about that then whatever, but it’s something to be aware of, especially if you’re not UVA’s typical admit. People reading this considering going to UVA should visit and check out the vibe of the school. You might find you like it or that “southern and historic” are just code words for plantation and slavery, as I have. Sure, you don’t need to be a partier to have fun every once in a while but let’s not pretend that bars and frats aren’t what the majority of what people do here. Most people here are partiers and participate in an absolutely massive drinking culture, if you’re not a fan of those things you’re in the minority. The gyms here suck for weightlifting, but they’re good for swimming, racquetball, basketball, and a bunch of other stuff. UVA professors I have found tend to be way, way better in the college than they are in the E-school. It makes sense, UVA is top tier for those liberal arts kind of things but pretty mediocre for the hard sciences, generally speaking. Some people on this subreddit will disagree with me because they believe “anyone can find their niche/group” and “anyone can be happy here” but I simply don’t believe that to be true. My personal advice to anyone starting at UVA and finding they’re unhappy is if you’ve gotten through your first semester and you still don’t like it, aren’t vibing with the school, find you don’t fit here etc. then begin thinking about transfer apps and looking to other schools. From that point on try and make things better for yourself but if you’re hating it still after 2 semesters here, well now you’ve got some options hopefully.",2020-05-24 06:31:47,4

comment,A very sincere fuck you to everyone partying at midsummers. Y'all some idiots.,"I mean, the fact that bars and frats are open at all is really incompatible with returning to school. Returning to school is risk enough without adding the risk of people gathering at bars and restaurants. This is true for K-12 as well.

comment,A very sincere fuck you to everyone partying at midsummers. Y'all some idiots.,"No, it is not unrealistic to expect people to stay home from parties. We live in a very unique time in world history- one where you can be locked up in your house and still stay connected to all your friends save for physical contact, courtesy of the Internet. What kind of weak-willed selfish cowards can’t put people’s lives over their own fun? People are DYING not because of some unpreventable force. It is sheer stupidity and incompetence to the point of malice. This sort of half-measure rely-on-the-goodness-of-people “encouragement” approach is what got us to three million and more cases. People across America have proven that they cannot be trusted to do the right thing, including much of UVA’s student body.

He’s saying it is unrealistic to expect young people not to go to parties for their college experience. This has been proven correct by midsummers. The flaws in his logic start by suggesting that because there is no ‘malice’ in their actions, we should refrain from disciplinary penalties and action, instead opting for a more kind, encouraging approach. He seems to forget that PEOPLE ARE DYING. THE MORE THIS VIRUS SPREADS, THE MORE THEY WILL DIE. Attending a party, knowing the stakes for your community, is action not far short of manslaughter. Kindness and encouragement are actions we do not have the luxury of because we have been trying that ever since the virus reached the United States and we are at three million cases.

To say you support “whatever works” and then to implicitly or explicitly endorse the actions of people which directly make the situation worse in the name of being understanding, i.e. stuff that does not work, is a logically invalid stance to take. If it helps, think of it as a argument between parent and child. You, as a parent, would not allow your child to eat a full tub of ice cream for dinner. You should explain to your child why you are not allowing them to do so- for their health- but if they still refuse to see reason, you do not then allow them to eat the ice cream anyway in the name of keeping the peace and being a ‘understanding parent’. I think this is a particularly good analogy for these times seeing as how many people going to these parties have been acting like spoiled children! And yes, you’re definitely going to be seen as the ‘bad guy’ for taking that stance, probably because people just like to jump on the downvote bandwagon. Who cares about em?

comment,A very sincere fuck you to everyone partying at midsummers. Y'all some idiots.,"There isn’t a ‘balance’ with personal freedoms. Freedoms and rights extend only so far as to not infringe upon those of others. Your right to free assembly, for example, only applies when your assembly doesn’t actively impede others’ right to assemble. It’s why protestors are allowed to form a picket line outside a place of work, at least on public property, but are not allowed to actively harass and beat scabs from crossing it and entering to do their job. Assembling at a party like these frats have allowed? Sure, they do have the ‘freedom’ to do it, but by allowing these parties to take place and perpetuating the spread of the virus, they pose a clear and present threat to the health and well-being of the community, especially more senior members. By exercising their freedom to do what they want on private property, they are actively infringing upon others’ rights to, you know, not die or become critically sick based on the selfishness of a low-risk population- actions of a group they have no control over. The actions of the frats and the party attendees are not actions of good people with good moral character. Because their actions cause the virus to spread, destroying lives and hurting people, they are morally wrong, and to a much worse degree than, say, choosing to cheat on a homework assignment.

comment,“Grades must be posted 48 hours after the final examination”,"Faculty here: I don't know any of my colleagues who are procrastinating on purpose. Fact is, this has been a super stressful semester for all of us, students and faculty alike. Teaching a full semester online, often with groups of students you never met in person, and juggling various students' tech needs (gotta remember which students can participate how in breakout rooms because student A is abroad and their VPN isn't working today (so no access to email, google docs, ...), student B has no audio, student C's connection keeps cutting out, etc.). Teaching during the election was especially disheartening because you could see how your students were struggling, but there's only so much you can do from a distance. We all get screen fatigue, so after a couple of hours teaching (5 days a week, plus meetings, advising sessions, the zillionth faculty development webinar, ...), grading can move down a couple of spots on your to-do list. Especially since for those of us who are used to grading on paper (especially if it means getting all of the papers at the same time after a test), figuring out how to do this efficiently online and in a way that is easy for students, too, can take significantly longer. So sometimes, you simply need to take a day or two to give your mental health a break and return to getting work done with a fresh(er) mind (I'd give the exact same advice to my students, too!). I really tried to be much more accommodating than usual this semester with deadline extensions, allowing students to resubmit assignments well after the deadline because their email attachments couldn't be opened, included only the exam prompt, or had attachments missing entirely, etc., and all I can hope is that my students will grant me the same leniency in turn. So yes, especially in this semester, grading may take a little bit longer, but at least personally, I believe that my students will benefit more if I can pay full attention to their assignments and offer them constructive feedback and compassion in this semester, which is much easier to do if I actually caught up on some sleep or basic self-care needs first. So yes, we see you struggling, but we hope you can see that we are in the same boat :-) And yes, I understand this is a meme and just trying to be funny, but please remember to be kind to your fellow humans! (And if you ever want to make your prof/TA's day, send them a thank-you email - they can mean such a great deal!) Much love, and please do take care of yourself/yourselves, too. You are all such amazing young people, and you deserve to rest and be happy, too. You ~~may~~ will probably forget the minutiae you learnt in a specific required class, but the person you're growing into and the self-care habits you pick up now will stay with you forever! Keep thriving and remember, less is often more, Prof C. (who submitted all her grades on Tuesday ;-))",2020-12-11 08:00:24,12

comment,And how long until they come for some of our UVA students? How long until it’s even citizens who are being detained?,"The move to citizens will be an easy one if they win the birthright citizenship case. Even if they only deny citizenship from relatively small classes of people, the effects will be on all of us. If they ban birthright citizenship from children of tourists or students, for example, these people have birth certificates. How do YOU prove your citizenship currently? You show your birth certificate. Pretty clear. Well what happens when they say, yeah ok you have a birth certificate, and, sorry for this, but, you now need to prove your parents were citizens when you were born, or at least that your parents were green card holders when you were born. Go get that information, otherwise we can't verify your status. Ok so then you need to track down the birth certificates of your parents. Most states won't give them to you unless your parents are dead. They don't want any identity theft. So now you need to beg your parents for a copy of their birth certificate. If your parents know you don't support them politically, maybe they won't give you a copy. Oops. Even if your parents are dead, you now need to go to possibly two more states to track down those birth certificates. And you will probably need death certificates to first prove your parents actually died. Whew, that's a lot of work. And odds are you will have to do this through the mail, because you can't travel to these states. You just don't have time. But if everyone is trying to do this, there might be quite the backlog. You could wait months. Ok but what if your parents weren't born here? Now you need to track down your parents visa information. That should be fun. Your problems here will be similar. The federal government likely won't give it to you if your parents are alive, so you either need to prove they're dead or ask your parents to help. Better hope you are all on good terms. I'm sure the federal government will be much quicker at these records requests now that they plan to fire 50% of all agency staff. They should be super quick, right? Oh, whats that? You got accused of a crime while waiting, and got arrested? Well, they can't verify your citizenship because you didn't get the documents yet, so, you will just have to wait in jail I guess. Or worse. Tough break kiddo. Maybe you're not a citizen after all.",2025-03-28 15:40:28,2

comment,Queen Elizabeth walks the Lawn before dinner at the Rotunda in 1976,"[The Royal Visit](https://uvamagazine.org/articles/a_royal_visit) In 1976, Queen Elizabeth II visited several cities in the United States to commemorate the nation’s bicentennial. On July 10, she toured Monticello and the Academical Village, where an estimated 18,000 people watched her stroll down the Lawn. Virginia Gov. Mills E. Godwin hosted a luncheon for the queen in the Dome Room of the Rotunda. A potentially uncomfortable moment for the queen was averted by professor Ray Bice and Alexander “Sandy” Gilliam Jr. (Col ’55), former secretary to the Rector and Visitors, and current University history and protocol officer. Before the event, Gilliam, who chaired the planning committee, walked the queen’s route at the same time of day she would. As he reached the top of the stairs to the Dome Room, he discovered “the sun would hit the queen right in her eyes and she wouldn’t be able to see anything,” said Gilliam. Bice came up with an ingenious solution. Accessing the Rotunda roof through a trap door, Bice glued white butcher paper to the oculus to block the sunlight. Because he used water-soluble glue, rain eventually washed the paper away. “That was just like Ray, to come up with a \[solution\] like that,” Gilliam said.",2022-09-08 15:14:29,52

This raises the question—why join a protest if you don’t fully support or even understand what it stands for? Also, are people aware that the government wouldn’t be taking legal action if the only issue at hand was someone’s speech? The students and the individual in question are also facing lawsuits from families of hostages—some confirmed dead, others possibly still alive. These lawsuits aren’t just about words; they allege that these individuals aided Hamas in some way, contributing to the massacre of innocent men, women, and children. There’s also evidence suggesting they had prior knowledge of the attack, with posts referencing and celebrating what was about to happen right before it took place. As you get older, you realize that the most valuable asset you have is time. If you’re going to dedicate your time to a cause you claim to care deeply about, it’s worth making sure you fully understand what you’re supporting. It’s shocking that groups affiliated with protests like these have been harassing, attacking, threatening, and even preventing Jewish students from safely attending college—simply for being Jewish. That alone should make anyone reconsider what they’re standing behind. I’d be willing to bet that most people attending this protest don’t actually know who Mahmoud is or the real context behind what’s happening. Personally, I wouldn’t waste a second of my time supporting something based on hearsay. Protesting can be an easy way to virtue signal—showing up just to claim you care—but when you look at the return on investment, it’s practically nothing. If people truly want to make a difference, education and financial success will always surpass what a protest could accomplish. And when you put in the effort to succeed in life, you might find your perspective on these issues shifting. Don’t fall into the trap of thinking you have endless time just because you’re young. Those with more life experience have something youth simply cannot—wisdom gained through surviving the hardships of life. Hopefully, this message encourages at least one person to take a step back and truly evaluate their choices. Lead, don’t follow. Create, don’t destroy. Be grateful for every day and the small things in life. If you want to change the world, do it for the better. The only guarantee in life is death, and the world doesn’t owe anyone anything. Good luck to all.",2025-03-26 22:18:50,1

A lot of people make bold remarks particularly about protests blocking traffic, but usually if a protest is on the street and protestors deny to allow passage, it’s because they received permission from their city council to do so.

Also, why don’t I hear these same frustrations about traffic blocking ambulances when it’s a football game and not a protest? Those are even worse for us! Not only are they often more difficult to navigate and often less coordinated than protests, but they’re for a less worthy cause’!

Cancelling class to support either side of a political agenda (and same as you, without offering an opinion on the Palestine issue) is undermining the core purpose of the students even being there, in my eyes.

post,"If you're going down to Danville, consider giving back to the community there.","If you're going down to Danville, consider giving back to the community there. This is not meant to shame anyone out of going to Danville and getting your vaccine. Get your vaccine, get things back to normal. Getting shots in arms by any means necessary is the right thing to do, obviously. All that said: the fact that there's so much excess vaccine in a city that's predominantly poor and Black is making me think someone up the chain significantly fucked up outreach/advertisement/distribution down there, and we're getting the opportunity to take advantage of that. A bunch of kids driving two hours south, getting their shot, and leaving isn't going to help matters for the people who live there, and the fact that they're openly advertising to us is weird. So I think, if you have the means and you're heading down to get your (free) vaccine, you should consider giving a bit of cash to an organization that does good work. It's a minor thing, but it's the only way I can think of giving Danville some benefit for suddenly being the vaccination hub for the greater Charlottesville area. Someone posted this list in a groupchat I'm a part of and it seems like a good starting point. Let me know if you know any other good orgs.

I don't aim to hurt any feelings or whatever, but holy god it's so hard to live around all these nova kids. Most are so boring & anti-social in the most basic sense. They can't hold a conversation and tend to stare at their phones any free second they have - no matter if it's class, walking between class, bathroom, waiting in lines, elevators, restaurants, bars, I consistently have noticed that nova kids use phones so much more. If you have the courage to talk to neighbors/people you see in passing often, the nova kids act like you're an alien. Sometimes they just stare when you try to make a joke or chat, as if you've broken some unfathomably important law and will be eliminated by a satellite laser beam in 3 seconds. Like Brainrot 2.0 hit those kids or something. I've never seen a population that's so dead inside and disconnected. This is based off real life, like completely cause I don't carry a phone with me & am not on social media. In all seriousness does anyone have concrete causal factors to point to?

comment,what makes people from NOVA so... like that?,It's the parents people! Parents in NoVA are architecting every aspect of their child's lives. What elementary or middle school kid needs to have an iPhone? NONE. It's a status symbol. A flip phone or lower cost phone is perfectly fine. Travel leagues/clubs create an untouchable elitist mindset that limits other student participation in sports. Paying for tutoring or paying for test prep or even PAYING FOR COLLEGE ESSAY WRITING.

What you have described above is the exact ""Alpha stare"" that has been sort of jokingly reported on before. It's just super introverted kids who also have never had to really do anything for themselves. It's not a nova thing, but I see how that region is really bad about producing extroverts who believe in doing the soft work like socializing to reach their goals. I'm from there. It's a land that tries to produce type A's like a factory and I'm a type B for sure. It's interesting to see the rate of brilliant kids crash tf out almost immediately in college or hitting the ""real"" employment world after because they just aren't prepared to adjust from the world of pre-announced rebruics in academia to working and getting along with regular people in a fluid workplace.",2025-09-14 05:57:07,1

I’m GenX and my parents hoped I’d be successful but just wanted me to be happy with my career decisions. It is not the same for Millennials and GenZ. They have way more stressors in life. Unfortunately, many of them measure themselves against peers on social media, worldwide. For GenX we just had to not be the biggest knucklehead in the town. I truly feel for many of these kids today.

comment,what makes people from NOVA so... like that?,"It’s probably not just a NoVA thing - maybe a lot like a UVA thing. Shyness, intellectual awkwardness, snobbery, fear of not being perfect or of making the “wrong” friends, classism, racism, elitism. My husband and I grew up in NoVA- I went to a better high school than he did (I lived in Fairfax, he in Alexandria/telegraph road), but I went to VCU and he went to UVA. He’s actually a UVA Law grad, too. VCU is infinitely more laid back, diverse, and easier to be yourself. UVA is competitive, posturing. God-forbid you’re weird or unique there. It was like my snobby high school all over again, which is why I didn’t go to UVA. But that was a long long time ago. Add the layer of internet, social media, having to always perform and market yourself online on top of having to perform socially and academically in person probably takes a lot of time. People need to escape so they duck into their phones. Or they need that free time to curate the perfect Insta or Snapchat post or whatever kids these days are using. I feel sorry for this generation. My kids are your age- 15 and 19- and they don’t use Instagram or TikTok or any of that stuff. And neither of them had/have any desire to go to UVA for the exact reasons you’re talking about. They want to go someplace friendly and open. Colleges that have great academics in a welcoming environment. All of that said, and what I tell my own teens, is you have to find your people. Find groups you wouldn’t ordinarily join, don’t stop trying to strike up a conversation. The whole school isn’t NoVA or snobs.

I think we can find something annoying or predictable about almost everyone we meet, but if you can remain open minded you may end up friends with a lot of interesting people you never would have expected to even meet.

Please be patient with yourself and don't be afraid to put your mental health first, even if that means dropping that class you've been considering.

comment,I think the majority of us are feeling this rn,"My first year was definitely stressful and overwhelming in the first semester, albeit likely because of the classes I was taking, but it's pretty normal for first years to get stressed out since they're usually coming from being the top of their class and getting straight A's. However, this year is especially bad. Typically you have fun clubs and hanging out with friends in the evenings and on weekends to look forward. It helps reduce the stress and you know you have support from everyone going through the same thing. On the other hand this year, everyone just seems miserable, including myself, despite living with 3 roommates and meeting up with other friends for outdoor distanced walks weekly. I don't think I'm nearly as miserable as the first years because I already have my friend base, so I can't even imagine how rough this is for you guys. I as well as most of my friends have dropped below 15 credits this semester just because we lack the motivation to get through the work. I felt ""lazy"" when I dropped them but I know it's best for my mental health, and quarantine has helped me realize that that's what's more important. Tldr; some amount of stress is normal, but once quarantine ends, it will get significantly better, so try to make the best of it that you can right now. Try your best to set down roots with people you think you will enjoy spending time with once lockdown ends and you get to enjoy real college life",2020-10-08 01:43:20,3

comment,I think the majority of us are feeling this rn,"Yeah, you'd think so, but it turns out trying to make sure my students understand the material and aren't stressed as hell is a severe misdeed and is a malicious behavior to engage in. I am, for example, a very bad man because I didn't want my student to take an exam at the normal exam time because she had to work and, even though we reached out two weeks in advance, we weren't told until two days before the test that one must choose either school or work to be a priority.",2020-10-07 19:50:40,22
comment,I think the majority of us are feeling this rn,"Oh, yeah that was probably me. It should be pointed out that part of the reason the material wasn't covered was because of -- what I would consider --mismanagement by the department. I think aside from that, we would have been on track. For example, there was confusion that put us behind in the second week of class, and the solution given was that we should just hold a class on the weekend to catch up, which was crazy. Also, some of the other instructors -- and even the coordinator in charge of structuring the class -- agrees that things are going to fast. I had been having conversations with people about this -- including the head of the department -- and it seemed like things were going well, so this decision to fire me from teaching seemed to come out of nowhere.",2020-10-07 20:29:23,9

We got away with a **lot** and would get a slap on the wrist \- I've seen racist-ass situations where brothers (let's say at other frats, never mine) are suspicious of black students trying to get into a party. \- I've had hundred year old antiques stolen out of my house (a clear violation of the honor code), and reported it to the IFC liaison to basically be told 'boys will be boys'. Like I don't even care that much about it, especially in hindsight, but it was apparently that IFC frats were given a huge amount of leeway and not subject to the same standards as the rest of the student body. No honor code trials here, not for the *good ol' boys* of the IFC. \- Hazing. We all know this is happening. It's *insane* that UVA would associate themselves with organizations that literally abuse 1st years and legitimize them \- The racial makeup of the IFC member organizations. I don't think I need to elaborate on this. &#x200B; Say I'm making all this up. It's still obvious that frats are a headache for any university. Why do you think UVa keeps them around? They're a huge liability, result in racism, classism, sexism (oh yeah, we used to brag about what girls we had sex with in our meetings and rate how hot they were, there was even an official joke position of a brother who had to report on all sexual activities within the house), and I bet lead to substance abuse more often than the general student body.

comment,If you don't laugh you'll cry,"Neither targeted UVA students, faculty, or staff. Both incidents started off Grounds, and the only connection to the University in both cases was proximity. The second one, the stabbing, started in the church parking lot across the street from Memorial Gym, and the suspect never got on the grounds. The first started on Fontaine Ave, where a car stopped for an expired inspection sticker and involved someone wanted by state police on multiple felony charges. They fled in the vehicle, crashed on Ivy Road, and into the area near UVA. The bulk of the search was in surrounding neighborhoods. One security camera picture that looked like the suspect was walking along Alderman Road was posted. That subject has been managing to elude the police for several weeks and, as of Saturday, was still at large but not thought to be in the area. It doesn't help that multiple jurisdictions were involved in both cases, so there were excess alert messages if you subscribe to the multiple alert systems used by the local government and the University. The every 15-minute alerts seem excessive, but given the number of people complaining that they don't see them, I guess they are justified.",2025-03-02 11:11:10,2

post,Homelessness,"Homelessness Recent CS graduate here, now currently homeless. I finished my undergrad with a decent GPA, two internships, and a few decent projects, but I couldn't find a job that I got this degree for. I tried networking at recruiting events and online, which helped me get to a few final rounds, none of which I have heard back from. I had the privilege of shelter from May up until two days ago where I was given the ultimatum and kicked from home. Between May and the day I was kicked I did nothing but work, leetcode, apply for jobs, network, and get yelled at every single day at home for being a failure (which I endured in exchange for shelter). The current opinion in this job market is that graduates are not entitled to a job, and that a degree doesn't mean jack shit. I do not agree or disagree with this, but it is ridiculous to expect mid-level skills from early career individuals, the entire point of early career programs is to hone graduates into people who will keep your company running in the future. We had been told from childhood that the way to higher income positions was to drain yourself in debt from college and get a job after that would pay off those debts. Now I am without a car, over five figures in credit card debt (acquired credit cards to pay for college since parents refused to, not that the University gave a shit), and cannot even work my retail job as I cannot drive to it or show up presentable. The reason I have no money is because it all went towards being able to live, use a car, and eat at home. I have no friends and family to reach out to for support. Genuinely, what am I supposed to do to survive? My situation has left me completely bitter, resentful, and has made me want to end it all. I have nothing left and no hope for a future.",2025-10-07 21:13:19,330

comment,Homelessness,"A lot of options in here, and someone else mentioned it, but I'd consider looking at the military. Maybe Air Force or Navy. Since you have a degree, you could even go to officer candidacy school. They might be able to help with student debt (but it sounds like yours is on CCs and not traditional loans, so maybe not). There are technical roles that you could look into and find something that hopefully leverages your degree/interests. Depending on what you do, when your service is complete you will probably have a security clearance of some sort which will open a lot of doors in the contracting space for the military/DoD/Govt.

comment,Homelessness,"I'm so sorry. This sounds extremely difficult. From my perspective: many young people are applying in the exact same way, to the exact same jobs, based on very similar skills. Hence the off-scale number of rejections. This observation may not bring much immediate comfort, but: the situation is adverse for many young people right now. It's not just you, though it sounds like you do have some particularly difficult circumstances. I won't play online therapist, but I will offer this concrete suggestion: cast your line in very different waters, and try not to repeat the same patterns. If that means working on a farm and milking cows for while, so be it!

Now the right is ready to bend the knee.* [https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2025/06/09/curtis-yarvin-profile](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2025/06/09/curtis-yarvin-profile) Yarvin proposes that nations should eventually be broken up into a “patchwork” of statelets, like Singapore or Dubai, each with its own sovereign ruler. The eternal political problems of legitimacy, accountability, and succession would be solved by a secret board with the power to select and recall the otherwise all-powerful C.E.O. of each sovereign corporation, or SovCorp. ... “There are figures who channel a Zeitgeist—Nietzsche calls them timely men—and Curtis is definitely a timely man,” a State Department official who has been reading Yarvin since the Moldbug era told me. Back in 2011, Yarvin said that Trump was one of two figures who seemed “biologically suited” to be an American monarch. (The other was Chris Christie.) In 2022, he recommended that Trump, if reëlected, appoint Elon Musk to run the executive branch. On a podcast with his friend Michael Anton, now the director of policy planning at the State Department, Yarvin argued that the institutions of civil society, such as Harvard, would need to be shut down. “The idea that you’re going to be a Caesar . . . with someone else’s Department of Reality in operation is just manifestly absurd,” he said. In another timeline, Yarvin might have remained an obscure and ineffectual internet crank, a digital de Maistre. Instead, he has become one of America’s most influential illiberal thinkers, an engineer of the intellectual source code for the second Trump Administration. “Yarvin has pushed the Overton window,” Nikhil Pal Singh, a history professor at N.Y.U., told me. His work has revived ideas that once seemed outside the bounds of polite society, Singh said, and created a road map for the dismantling of “the administrative state and the global postwar order.” .... When I recently visited Yarvin’s Craftsman home, in Berkeley, I noticed a painting that Thiel had given him: a portrait of Yarvin in the style of a role-playing-game character card, bearing the legend “Philosopher.” As I sipped tea from a novelty mug featuring an image of Yarvin with a cartoon crown, he told me that it would be “cringe” for him to broadcast his relationship with Thiel—or with Vance, for that matter, whom he met through Thiel around 2015. “Does a normal Ohio voter read . . . Mencius Moldbug? No,” Vance reportedly said one night at a bar during the 2021 National Conservatism Conference. “But do they agree with the broad thrust of where we think American public policy should go? Absolutely.” “He’s a really cool guy,” Yarvin said of the Vice-President, who followed him on X earlier this year.",2025-06-28 11:54:26,18

Anyone with a moderate or conservative viewpoint is suppressed. I’m sure you think that’s BS. It isn’t. Google Morgan Bettinger (and her tormentor Zyahna Bryant) and Matan Goldstein. Ryan threw these students to the wolves, knew they were being persecuted, and did nothing. They both successfully sued UVA. Ryan is not a good guy. Any parent should despise him after what he’s let happen to those kids. Also, since October 7 antisemitism has been rampant. I am very close to the large and active Jewish parent group who have repeatedly gone to Ryan for help. He did nothing. You can choose to believe this or not. Ryan is superficially charming, bright, clever….and totally duplicitous. As the father of 3 girls, 2 of whom are UVA alumnae, I contend what he did alone to Matan and Morgan should have resulted in his termination. So, that’s my detained response.

post,Feeling Proud,"Feeling Proud When I told my friends I was applying to UVA they said I would never get in, and to be frank I believed them to an extent. I was a good student, but I still had my doubts as I knew how selective this school was. Needless to say I was not very optimistic, but it was my dream school and I held out just a bit of hope. Finally on December 10th I got my acceptance letter. My face never went redder than it did then as I told my parents I got it. My parents always believed in me even when others didn’t. They were ecstatic, this acceptance held special significance for my family. I was the first person in our entire family to attend a college, my grandfather never completed fourth grade, my father only High school. I know the hard work has just begun, but for the first time in a while I’m feeling truly proud. I cannot wait to attend next fall. Wahoowa!

Professors live here in this community and social media and they see these grossly irresponsible things too. Additionally, the administration sees these things (and more!), so they kick the can further down the road before they can reasonably expect professors to teach in person again, because they recognize the extreme anti-social obscenity as depicted in this photo. Absent behavioral change — which can be driven by the administration as well as students — then Fall 2021 and Spring 2022 will be Zoom U all over again.

Grow up and be responsible. There are other people in this world too.,"FWIW, this happened during the first semester and there was little impact with our rates remaining very low compared to the state. The big jump in VA seems tied to Thanksgiving and Christmas. If memory serves, the semester ended pre thanksgiving, with pretty solid testing before released on grounds student and decent random off ground testing. It does not seem like much of the big Christmas spike could be placed on the students. We had a daughter in law who went a birthday party 12/22 at her families house. Saw the pics on facebook. Looks like around 20 people from 4-5 families. Then one of the people at the party discovered they were working with a positive tested person. I think it is more than crap than students. And honestly, I would not be surprised if their was some herd already in this group. Six weeks from now when the weather is clearing, the vax starts to get deeper the end will be in sight. Until then, take it from this old guy with lots of kids and grandkids: never underestimate the stupidity of kids in crowds. Good luck.",2021-01-31 15:28:17,7

Not to mention so many people, especially those in higher risk group, have not received the vaccine or have received the vaccine long enough (35 days since the first shot) for it to be working. and tbh I can’t wait for most of us get vaccinated I hope that happens before May so that we could have some normal in person experience:((",2021-01-31 12:44:54,5

They absolutely should stack up after fast food workers, who have to interact with tons of people and have little resources other than to work in that crappy job. Chances a professor is sweating and frustrated for 8 hours a day? Same with construction workers. They keep the economy rolling far more than a professor does and have to interact with a lot of people who may/may not be strongly focused on their bubbles. Many are lower income, rural and/or immigrant with limited resources. But I stand by my thinking that in 6 weeks the end will be in sight. Vax mess will be cleaning up, springtime will get people outside, positivity rate has dropped from 8.3% to 6.8% in last week alone.

That’s not including anything about DEI. So yeah, your fellow Cavaliers are having their career paths altered severely, with some not might being able to finish college here.

There was literally no reason to allow bid stuff to happen in person but UVA let it happen anyway, and now COVID cases are spiking and all gatherings are banned. The community is suffering because UVA let frats be an exception to a good rule for no reason.

comment,I'm tired of the gathering limit double standard between frats and the rest of UVA,"If you want to be angry at someone be angry at Dean Groves and ODOS. The IFC and ISC are student run organizations, therefore, they needed to have meetings and permissions from the administration in order to proceed. By allowing the IFC and ISC to lift their ban on gatherings for the express purpose of rush, the administration is almost solely responsible for the usual market based competition that ensues for a limited supply of people at 31 fraternities and 16 sororities. Further, everyone looks at the first years as the victims of this process, they are partly complicit, most places that I know of had virtual and in-person plans for action, but those who had both at the same time saw their ""clients"" (being first years), continually show up at those events in-person and choosing to forgo the virtual ones (not sparing any blame for the orgs, but at this point it is beating a dead horse). Again this is all based on the decision by the ODOS and those in negotiation with the IFC and ISC to cave. Finally, instead of being angry at a double standard, let's be more angry at this blatant attack on civil liberties of individuals (I can accept 6 or 5 people gatherings, even 2 or 3, but now people in relationships can't technically hang out because of they are not of the same household give me a damn break).",2021-02-16 19:05:24,58

post,Letter from UVA’s Brie Gertler about tomorrow’s walkout,"Letter from UVA’s Brie Gertler about tomorrow’s walkout Text of the letter: “Dear members of the faculty and other instructors, It has come to my attention that there has been a call by several organizations for a walkout on central Grounds at 11:30 tomorrow (Wednesday, March 26th), with some students beginning on North Grounds at 11:10. I understand that you are scheduled to teach at that time, and I am writing to make sure that you are aware of this and to provide some guidance about how to respond if one or more of your students chooses to participate in the walkout. Promoting free expression and free inquiry on Grounds is core to our mission and integral to who we are, and it is not a violation of University policy for a student to walk out of a class, so long as they do so peacefully and without disrupting the class. At the same time, walking out of (or being absent from) class may have academic consequences for students, depending on the existing class attendance policies established by the instructor or school. Instructors are obligated to protect the free speech rights of students in academic situations such as classes, where instructors have a designated institutional role and corresponding authority and responsibilities. Please keep in mind that instructors bear this obligation to every student, regardless of the student's opinions about the walkout or the issues related to it. Our commitment to protect expressive activity lives alongside our commitment to our educational mission, and all Wednesday classes should be held as scheduled. Information about protests, demonstrations, and gatherings on University property is available at freespeech.virginia.edu. If you receive questions from your students about University policies, I encourage you to direct them to this resource. Best, Brie Gertler Interim Executive Vice President and Provost”",2025-03-25 18:27:42,305

comment,Letter from UVA’s Brie Gertler about tomorrow’s walkout,"Well, they probably aren’t paying a tuition just to stage a walkout for one, and two why would no one care? You don’t seem to, but that doesn’t mean it isn’t important to others.",2025-03-26 08:45:06,13

From Sabre the horse, to the cavalier marching band, to the lights and music, to the game and fans itself… the energy and atmosphere at Scott Stadium was alive and well! How lucky are we to have this in our backyard here in Charlottesville?! It might not be the same crowd size as years past, but unless you’re there at the game, you can’t argue that it’s not worth going to anymore. I do think the food options could be better, but overall I was impressed after not going to a game in ages. Sports have a way of bringing people together and escaping the world for a bit. For a few hours it’s just you and thousands of people coming together to cheer on the home team. I saw more smiles and laughter last night than I had in a long time.

post,Asian Student Union doesn't represent all Asians,"Asian Student Union doesn't represent all Asians I'm a 2nd-gen Chinese-American student. While the ASU claims to ""unite, advocate for, and empower"" our community, I would like everyone to know that the ASU doesn't speak for a lot of Asian students at UVA. It mixes concerns which are legitimate to the Asian-American community (such as combatting anti-Asian racism) with radical activism which doesn't represent all Asians at UVA. The following examples show how the ASU has frequently abused its position as an advocate for general Asian interests in favor of promoting positions which do not have a consensus among the Asian community: 1. ASU is one of the most anti-Israel clubs on campus. It is one of only 7 student organizations that signed onto Referendum 1, which calls to divest from Israel. Only 3 weeks after the horrific attack on Israeli civilians on October 7th, the ASU participated in a walkout to protest against Israel. Asian-Americans have diverse views on Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and taking the most hardline position on the conflict is not representative of our diverse collective views as a community. 2. ASU uses sweeping and controversial critiques of the American project to advocate a soft-on-CCP foreign policy. See their full statement they made on their Instagram here: ""Violence towards Asians and Asian Americans in this present moment can, in no way, be separated from the long histories of U.S. militarism, imperialism, and racial capitalism. Anti-Asian violence is a core tenet of the American settler colonial project, and it is under these conditions that white supremacy thrives. Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, there have been about 3800 reported incidences of violence toward Asians and Asian Americans. Simultaneously, we have witnessed the past and current administration become increasingly hostile toward China, stoking sinophobic, inflammatory narratives about COVID-19 and escalating military expansion and action to 'counter China' through warmongering rhetoric and demonization of nations abroad. We directly attribute the murders of March 16 to the state’s anti-Asian stance that is so deeply embedded in white supremacist frameworks and ideals."" As a Chinese-American whose grandpa suffered persecution for his anti-communist views, this post which was made by a CIO that claims to advocate for Asians generally definitely does not represent me. I strongly believe that the actions the current Biden administration is taking to counter the Chinese government is entirely justified. As a Chinese-American who is joining the National Guard with 2 other Asian friends who are joining the Navy ROTC, I strongly disagree with the critiques levied against US militarism. I acknowledge that there are Asians who agree with the ASU's statements, but to imply that such a statement garners consensus support among Asians at UVA is deeply inaccurate. To those in power, I would ask you to not take the ASU as an organization that is representative of general Asian interests. It is an activist group who is falsely claiming that they are advocating for our community at-large. &#x200B; &#x200B;",2024-02-26 04:10:09,301

comment,Asian Student Union doesn't represent all Asians,"To represent a culture anywhere, let alone a college campus, is deeply political in nature. Surely there are other areas in UVA that represent views that align more with yours, but to have a cultural organization that fails to make a position on a situation or conflict that puts other minorities or marginalized people at risk is to ignore the shared struggles that people of color have faced through the years, that including all of the atrocities pertaining to Asia in the 20th century. I believe that it is important for them to make statements like that; activism and advocacy are not mutually exclusive things either. It just doesn't sound like that is the right space for you. You seem to be more closely connected to the US military, so it would make sense that you aren't too happy to hear that ASU is protesting against the genocidal acts of a US ally, but I am surprised that you are resistant to the claims to Sinophobia regarding the American stance towards China. It isn't necessarily that Joe Biden and the military's posturing towards China is sinophobic in itself, but the rhetoric that they have allowed to spread does, to some degree, carry anti-Chinese sentiment. Surely you can at least see that if you brought up the point of antisemitism in the comments. Again, it also seems that ASU posted about the Israel-Palestine conflict after the outbreak of war and the pretty evident destruction and murder of the Palestinian people at the hands of the IDF, in the name of wiping out Hamas. But taking a step back and looking at the big picture, I think as Asians in America we can appreciate other non-Asian Americans supporting Stop Asian Hate and standing in solidarity with Asian people. Don't you think it is at least justified for them to say something in support of the Palestinian people in this time?",2024-02-29 22:17:20,3

comment,Asian Student Union doesn't represent all Asians,"White dude here but with a lot of these groups they're gonna be dominated by left leaning individuals just due to how people perceive race in relation to politics. Due to then having a lot of leftist who also conflate being Anti-American with being pro-other Anti-American countries which results in support of countries who are legitimately much worse, but they're seen as opponents of America making them seem good to support. This makes a really dangerous dichotomy that ends up with leftist enabling/supporting/defending/excusing/etc things they accuse America of, or worse. These countries also push propaganda on this(Russia/USSR is well documented as pushing Anti-Imperialist propaganda on these groups, or China has historically used being a victim of colonizing as an excuse despite being a colonizer too) to bolster these claims. While I'm left and my friends are, we understand that America has made many mistakes, as have many countries, but that doesn't mean other countries who oppose America are benevolent nations with good intentions.",2024-02-26 14:07:10,5

Keep it simple, be truthful, and confident and just let it flow. Smile and nod or wave. Not weirdly, but small smirk or whatever. Most people will smile back. You want to be warm and inviting. Then let the rest flow. I've found that when you are smart, you can help them figure things out or be handy, and that's where you can really make a connection. When it feels right, offer your number to go for a run, grab some lunch, or a study session to or to talk some more. Tell them about the best study spots you've found or flex your coffee knowledge and offer to buy a cup. A few of these things here and there should put you on the right path. Just be genuine.",2024-03-13 07:04:40,2

comment,How to get a gf here?,"I think it's hard to really give accurate advice on this, without knowing a lot more.... I hope you find what you are looking for. The following story is sarcastic advice. Hopefully it will show things could be worse even with a girlfriend. It IS however the way a sophomore ""courted"" me as a freshman. The relationship lasted almost two years until I got more therapy. Find a girl in your dorm ideally.... One who seems a tiny bit sad, befriend her. Spend two or three months being her best friend. Go to dinner every night. See what she's doing on the weekends. If she is in her room, invite her over to watch something you think she will enjoy. Then tell her you've fallen in love and can not be her friend anymore it hurts tooo much.... Your slightly depressive female friend will not have the coping skills to adjust and then decide to date you. When she decides to look at you romantically take it even further. Say you need her to be your girlfriend and she can't see anyone else. Again, she has built no other coping mechanisms for such a drastic change and she will agree. BOOM girlfriend!!! I do not suggest this method as both parties were foolish for getting involved. However, it is the story of my first college boyfriend.",2024-03-13 11:07:30,1

comment,How to get a gf here?,"Having a gf takes time, so it wouldn’t hurt to budget in that time now. Try: 1 hr/wk at a club that interests you + 1hr/wk getting coffee with someone After a few weeks, ask a girl from your club to coffee to get to know her, no strings attached. If you like her, ask her next week. If you don’t, ask someone else. Girls are much more likely to say yes to coffee than to a date. The key is to genuinely want to know them as people, not as prospective gfs. Give them time to decide whether they want you before letting on that you might be interested. Like others have said, girls can smell desperation a mile away. They want someone who wants THEM, not a girlfriend in the abstract. Source: worked for me",2024-03-13 13:03:14,1

In the hopes of ensuring that the funding is not stripped from the school, members of the school’s oversight board who were appointed by Gov. Glenn Youngkin, a Republican, have been in discussions with Justice Department to learn what could be done, according to a person briefed on the matter.

post,Christian's on the Corner,"Christian's on the Corner I know most students are packing up and heading home, but for those of us who are here year round, I wanted to share this. Three of my staff members went into Christians at lunchtime today. After a litany of outrageous comments, the guy behind the counter said ""we serve men first"" as he rung up a man who arrived after them and gave that man something for free. I've looked for contact info for the location online (I believe locations are independently owned), but can't find it. ETA: A contact of mine got word to Christian, who sold the location years ago, but he's apparently reaching out to the owner.",2025-05-09 13:56:03,288

comment,Christian's on the Corner,That’s soooooo gross!!! I’m so sorry. To any students reading this: now is a good time to mention that crozet pizza runs deals for us.

comment,UVA’s newest email in summary,"This is true in the short term, but I think we can all agree that we’d rather not get covid than get covid. Also, getting the virus and not knowing you have it is probably worse as you might spread it to others. Keep in mind many Americans are considered high risk due to preexisting conditions like high blood pressure, high cholesterol etc. We could also spread it to service industry workers inadvertently or even our very own staff and faculty, who are more at risk. Not only that, but the long term health effects of this virus are unknown, my friend, who got covid a month ago, still can’t taste fully. Though I don’t want to make a mountain out of a mole hill I think that it’s odd uva is shifting their tone saying that even when students get infected we can still call it a success, but that it’s also 100% on students to minimize that spread. They preach student responsibility all the while uva is doing wildly irresponsible things like selling football tickets, allowing those who don’t have any reason to live in on grounds housing live on grounds, refusing to budge on tuition, and placing a 6 week limit on housing refunds(among other things). So yes, you’re right, we’ll probably be fine, but a lot of other people won’t, and uva shouldn’t be let of the hook for that.",2020-08-21 09:36:01,6

comment,Job market is so cooked UVA sent an out a sympathy email,"For the person who commented that they didn’t understand and had seen many job openings - here is an educational response for you. 1)many jobs currently listed as “entry level” require 3+ years of experience, which make people who are actually “entering” after school unqualified. 2)hiring companies will post job availabilities knowing full well they are hiring internally, making those openings “ghost postings.” 3)many companies are now using AI to “read” through resumes. Any that the AI cannot read are immediately discarded and often the applicant is never told why. 4)the process of selecting an employee is taking longer and longer. Internships/jobs that take months and multiple test projects are not worth anyone’s time. 5)the political scene right now has made many companies post availability, hire, and then have to drop their new hires due to funding cuts. 6)A job that pays $18/hr in the DC area is essentially a small stipend, not a liveable wage. Offering that to someone with a master’s, as many companies have been doing, is laughable.

comment,Job market is so cooked UVA sent an out a sympathy email,"The next few years are going to be the most consequential we’ve had in a long time (certainly since the GFC, probably longer). CS students specifically, I’m truly sorry. You’ve been led to believe your hard work on that degree is a certain path to a fruitful and safe career. That will continue to be true for some, but a significant number of others will be left holding the bag. The collapse of the job market in that area came very quickly. ChatGPT and LLMs in general weren’t widely available when you started school. But the reality is quickly evolving. What I’d recommend to you all still in school and without a job is be intentional about evaluating your career path going forward. UVA alums are happy to talk if you have a good reason and genuine interest in what they do (don’t spam inboxes). In this world you HAVE to know someone that can influence the hiring process to get a job. The days of filling out 100 cold applications and getting 5-10 interviews are over. Every sexy job opening will get thousands of apps if they even are planning to hire externally. Ask yourself these questions: 1. What do I enjoy doing? What brings my happiness beyond the fact it’ll provide me with a paycheck? 2. Can I draw links between my values, my personality, and my fulfillment needs in life? 3. Based on those links, what other career options would make sense and keep me (and family if that’s in the cards) happy, fulfilled, and full Take it from this alum, I’m pulling for you all but you gotta act now. Literally examine every non traditional option that fulfills the criteria. Take your parents with a grain of salt, they grew up in the pension era.

comment,Job market is so cooked UVA sent an out a sympathy email,"We've been through this about 10 years ago or so. I remember going to a Mexican restaurant with my UVA gear on. When our waiter approached, he said Wahoowa! I was a bit surprised. It wasn't summer time. He told me he graduated but couldn't find a job, so he grabbed the waiter gig. Another UVA grad I ran into was at the ATT store... he was selling phones. I remember thinking, WTF? At that point, you'd have been better off not spending all that tuition money to get a job that a GED person could get. Or use that money towards trade school (AC company, plumbing, mechanic). Later on, I realized, at least the waiter, the ATT sales guy were not just sitting around waiting for something that may not come. They were already out earning some money and gaining some experience in the real world... esp one where you have to deal with actual ppl. So long story short, yeah, it may suck to get a ""shitty"" job right after 4 years of college, but that's better than sitting around and not getting any income. You can still be looking at the same time you're working the ""lesser job"". I worked the career fairs for my company at UVA for many years in the past decade....amazing candidates always.

comment,Job market is so cooked UVA sent an out a sympathy email,"“Dear Third Year Students: I hope you are doing well as the semester wraps up. Spring has been beautiful, and I hope you’ve found time to enjoy it! I was thrilled to begin my new role as UVA’s Dean of Students on March 24. It is truly an honor to be selected for this important position, and it has been a highlight for me to attend student performances, meetings, and events. Coming from the leadership of the UVA Career Center, I recognize the difficulty of today’s job market, and the resulting rescinding of internship and job offers for many students. We are committed to providing you with resources during this uneasy time. I am pleased to share that the UVA career services community, in partnership with the Alumni Association, Office of Alumni Engagement, Student Financial Services, and Advancement, is launching an outreach campaign to alumni and friends of UVA to invite them to host Summer 2025 projects and internships, and to share any full-time job opportunities. We are also grateful for the generous support of the UVA Parents Council, which has provided funding to support internship stipends for undergraduate third-year students engaging in unpaid internships. We will be working to source a range of remote (and some in person) opportunities across industries and functions. I recognize the great need, so we hope this can be another avenue to help your search process. While it will be challenging to support every student, we hope to assist with some positive outcomes. We invite you to share your status: I have secured an unpaid internship and would like to be considered for grants. Please complete this brief survey. OR I am actively seeking and would like to learn about internship and project opportunities available through UVA alumni. Please complete this brief survey. Once you respond to the survey that aligns with your status, we will add you to an email list so you receive alerts about how to pursue grant funds or where you can access project/internship opportunities. While the experiences offered by UVA alumni may differ from your original objectives for this summer, we encourage you to be open and to leverage these opportunities to build skills and expand your career story. Additionally, our career advisors remain available to help you with strategies around your resume, applications, interviewing, and searches. Please schedule an appointment anytime through Handshake. We look forward to staying in touch to offer both support and access to opportunities and resources. Best wishes as you finish up the semester. Please remember the importance of self-care, maintaining a positive outlook, and asking for help when you need it. Warm regards, Dean Hall”",2025-04-30 18:55:07,82

comment,Job market is so cooked UVA sent an out a sympathy email,"Fascinating … as an alarm graduated in the late 80s and a business owner in Virginia, I was never asked to provide an internship or anything like they are discussing. Along those lines, I want all students to understand that it’s time to find a job the old-fashioned way. Applying for nonexistent jobs on the Internet is not going to cut it. There are too many comments here about fake jobs being listed and AI screening resumes. You have to start building your own professional network. Start with your professors. Ask them what graduates they have taught that they would recommend you connecting with. Go on informational interviews to learn more about people and the jobs they do. Ask them who else they would recommend you talking to. UVa alumni love their own. And I have seen comments that I consider relatively bullshit where they say you have to be privileged in order to give advice like this. Well, my response is that UVA is widely thought of as an extremely strong college. That alone is a privilege. Students are going to have to do the hard work to land a job in this economy. That is absolutely fair and true. But let’s get out there and do the hard work. Time to get gritty.",2025-07-13 08:55:18,1

comment,Job market is so cooked UVA sent an out a sympathy email,"Yep. Frustrating. Imagine now though that instead of just sending a resume, you actually went on interviews for a bunch of nonexistent jobs. That is the situation for many actors. Union rules require producers to hold auditions, so they hold auditions for roles that, behind the scenes, are already cast. Should we discard the union rule? No, because every so often someone breaks through or makes an impression now that grows into a role later in a different production. So as a job seeker (1) keep plugging away; (2) use the fact that not every opening is real to take the pressure off yourself, relax, play with it, take some chances, etc.; and (3) look for ways to make your own opportunities. Look at all the actors who came through stand-up comedy in recent years. They made a way to do the work on their own. Then the jobs came to them. That example might not translate to all worlds, but maybe some pieces are useful. In fact, it sometimes applies to another marketplace called dating. Some people go on dates not because they have any romantic interest in you but to get out of the house, be seen, be in the mix, etc. You can be upset about “being used” or you can adjust to the reality. It certainly takes the pressure off any given date. So be yourself, and if they don’t turn your way, then you, too, were out and in the mix. You turn more heads out there than sitting home.",2025-05-02 11:04:59,1

The people conducting the interviews were dull, the jobs generally vague in description, and every interview had heavy focus placed on explaining how to game / traverse a gs compensation scale. Despite getting offers or invites to final onsite interviews to most of these positions, I couldn’t imagine parking my career before it even started in a system that goes out of its way to disincentivize risk taking, innovation, and professional growth.

But according to the COVID-19 Thomas Jefferson Health District Portal (https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/thomas-jefferson/tjhd-covid-19-data-portal/), the current 7-day rolling average of new COVID cases is currently less than it was in August. I know how much students are sacrificing for public health and safety. Reading the posts on this subreddit, it is clear that the sacrifices are mental and emotional as well. I just want to say THANK YOU for everything you are doing to keep people safe. I know that all your work can be thankless, but I am truly grateful to see a low COVID count at the moment.

For what it's worth, we used to walk over to the hill for a quarter just to enjoy the atmosphere and see the students. I imagine others did the same.

Even when teams were bad in the 80s, people would go to watch, go out at halftime and then come back.

I attended in the 80s as a student and have gone to less games every year but still on occasion. My impression is they keep adding more rules year after year. Also, a lot of students used to enjoy the pep band before the game because it was funny as hell. A lot of what was cool about going to UVa games is now meh, but I’m just an old geezer. Maybe current students just aren’t used to winning seasons or seasons without horrible things. Also noon games have always sucked for students and now they suck for old people too because the traffic around Charlottesville is more horrible every year and you can’t get there in time.

comment,Too bad most students missed the thrilling 4th quarter comeback,"I used to work in/around UVA Athletics. A couple years ago, we had a big meeting about improving student attendance. I shared my viewpoint that UVA needed to significantly increase Wi-Fi accessibility in the stadium. While this is true for everyone, it is especially true for current students. Asking students to go four hours without checking their apps is an absolute nonstarter. I explained that UVA needed to install enough Internet bandwidth so that 40,000 people could stream videos of other games, check their Instagram reels, or surf Facebook/Reddit during halftime during commercials. My suggestion was that the administration fully wire the student section of the stadium, even if it meant diminishing Internet access for ticket-buyers. This is not a trade-off that should be required - ideally UVA would have great WiFi in the whole building. But if there is a limited amount of bandwidth, UVA would do well to Wire the student sections to have faster Internet than the rest of the stadium. It is absolutely mandatory for the student experience to be able to check their phone during the game. The senior administrator looked me dead in the face, and said, “ there is no way that is true. We can do other things to keep students attention. They can go four hours without being on their phone.” They are freaking clueless.",2024-10-06 20:28:41,62

comment,"UVA student club endorses murders in Israel, says they are ""a step towards a free Palestine"".","This is from 2014 but still has relevance. “I don’t think Israel should exist as a Jewish state. I think it is obscene, irrational and unjustifiable to have a state organized around a religion. So I don’t celebrate the idea that there’s a Jewish homeland in the Middle East. I certainly don’t support any Jewish claims to real estate based on the Bible… but the truth is that there is an obvious, undeniable, and hugely consequential moral difference between Israel and her enemies. The Israelis are surrounded by people who have explicitly genocidal intentions towards them. The charter of Hamas is explicitly genocidal. It looks forward to a time, based on Koranic prophesy, when the earth itself will cry out for Jewish blood, where the trees and the stones will say “O Muslim, there’s a Jew hiding behind me. Come and kill him.” This is a political document. We are talking about a government that was voted into power by a majority of Palestinians. The discourse in the Muslim world about Jews is utterly shocking. Not only is there widespread Holocaust denial—there’s Holocaust denial that then asserts that we will do it for real if given the chance. The only thing more obnoxious than denying the Holocaust is to say that it should have happened; it didn’t happen, but if we get the chance, we will accomplish it. There are children’s shows in the Palestinian territories and elsewhere that teach five-year-olds about the glories of martyrdom and about the necessity of killing Jews. And this gets to the heart of the moral difference between Israel and her enemies. And this is something I discussed in The End of Faith. To see this moral difference, you have to ask what each side would do if they had the power to do it. What would the Jews do to the Palestinians if they could do anything they wanted? Well, we know the answer to that question, because they can do more or less anything they want. The Israeli army could kill everyone in Gaza tomorrow. So what does that mean? Well, it means that, when they drop a bomb on a beach and kill four Palestinian children, as happened last week, this is almost certainly an accident. They’re not targeting children. They could target as many children as they want. Every time a Palestinian child dies, Israel edges ever closer to becoming an international pariah. So the Israelis take great pains not to kill children and other noncombatants. What do we know of the Palestinians? What would the Palestinians do to the Jews in Israel if the power imbalance were reversed? Well, they have told us what they would do. For some reason, Israel’s critics just don’t want to believe the worst about a group like Hamas, even when it declares the worst of itself. We’ve already had a Holocaust and several other genocides in the 20th century. People are capable of committing genocide. When they tell us they intend to commit genocide, we should listen. There is every reason to believe that the Palestinians would kill all the Jews in Israel if they could. Would every Palestinian support genocide? Of course not. But vast numbers of them—and of Muslims throughout the world—would. Needless to say, the Palestinians in general, not just Hamas, have a history of targeting innocent noncombatants in the most shocking ways possible. They’ve blown themselves up on buses and in restaurants. They’ve massacred teenagers. They’ve murdered Olympic athletes. They now shoot rockets indiscriminately into civilian areas. And again, the charter of their government in Gaza explicitly tells us that they want to annihilate the Jews—not just in Israel but everywhere."" https://www.samharris.org/podcasts/making-sense-episodes/why-dont-i-criticize-israel",2023-10-11 02:28:19,6
comment,"UVA student club endorses murders in Israel, says they are ""a step towards a free Palestine"".","Today, October 11, international press and Israeli soldiers validated that over 40 babies were murdered in their beds. Hamas was not satisfied with mere genocide. They also beheaded the babies and left their bodies strewn on the ground. Perhaps the ""Students for Justice in Palestine at UVA"" could explain how this barbaric behavior is remotely defensible. Over 1,000 innocent Israeli citizens were murdered. Young women were raped and tortured. Elderly, defenseless men and women were murdered and kidnapped. Palestinian citizens in Gaza chortled and further desecrated their dead bodies that were transported in open trucks driven by exultant Hamas butchers on the Palestinian streets of the Gaza Strip. The idea of a separate Palestinian state is over. These acts unequivocally prove the Palestinian visceral hatred of Israel and Jews is not only implacable, it is antithetical to basic norms of humanity. Israel needs to eradicate Hamas, then put any complicit Palestinian citizens extolling or abetting Hamas' genocide in jail for life or on trial for murder, sentencing them to the death penalty. They have abrogated their right to further life on this earth. Let St. Peter deal with them, and they better pray that Allah has some sway with him. I doubt he does.

Surprise surprise Palestinians are humans too, and have limited patience with all the false accusation’s we’re sifting through. The quote from the journalist you placed here does not prove infant beheadings or rape. I’m not denying civilians are being massacred so not sure what you’re trying to prove there. The IDF has said there’s no evidence to substantiate this yet and no credible news source has reported it, but if you want to go with TMZ and Daily Mail that’s your call. As for the partition plans, yeah that’s not how that works. You have to look at historical context. The Palestinians and Arabs were living there and were promised by the British Arab sovereignty in the region in exchange for revolting against the Ottomans, they also populated to and tended most of the land there. Mass Jewish immigration follows this but Jews remain a minority only owning 3-4% of the land. The British have now gone back on their promise and are promising Jewish immigrants a state and suddenly giving large percentages of land to them that they’re not entitled to, yeah obviously they’re going to reject it. As for the famous partition plan in 1947, which bumped that number up to 55% despite there being twice as many Arabs in the entire country and Jews only owning 5% of the land, I mean yeah why wouldn’t they be taking these deals. Many members of the Zionist congress also made their reason for accepting these partitions that they were good starting points to taking the rest of the land.",2023-10-11 10:10:19,3

comment,"UVA student club endorses murders in Israel, says they are ""a step towards a free Palestine"".","I don't agree with what Hamas is doing but... it's really not that hard to understand. Back around the end of World War 1, the Palestinians pretty much lived in the area we now call Israel and they were under British colonial rule. People who would think of modern Palestinians as ""their people"" had been living in that same area for roundabouts 1000 years. After World War 2, a Jewish homeland was just up-and-created in that region and the people who'd been living there basically for 1000 years were told to get stuffed. They moved (or were moved) off their land so the Jews could have a homeland. Since then the borders of Israel have continuously expanded and the people who lived in that place have become second-class citizens if not outright prisoners in their ancestral home. None of that is to diminish what happened to the Jews in the Holocaust. I'm just recognizing that Israel wasn't created out of a tractless desert. People lived there and they were forced from their homes. Now, if you or I were marched out of our home at gunpoint we'd probably be pretty pissed off about it, right? We'd say we have a right to defend our homes. We'd fight back, right? Except the Palestinians are just WILDLY outclassed by the Israeli military. Like, it's not even funny. In terms of a symmetric, conventional conflict, Hamas represents about as much of a threat to the Israeli military as the Girl Scouts do. So, now here's the question: **GIVEN THAT** should the Palestinians just give up and flee their homes? Should they just abandon the land their ancestors have tended for 1000 years, uproot their lives, and go... where? Where even _can_ they go? Who will take them and what future can they possibly have? And if they don't do that, and they can't fight the Israeli military what is left to them but terrorism? We can say ""this will only cause more deaths to Palestinians"" but that's not true because, from their point of view, they're already dead if they don't fight back. And in that situation, if the only way you can effectively hurt your enemy is to hurt his civilian population... that's what you do. And let's not pretend that our history much better. Americans were all too happy to engage in brutal terror bombing campaigns when it was too costly to put our infantry into harms way. We were happy to exterminate our Native American populations like vermin when they stood in the way of Westward Expansion. And we were happy to torture the hell out of people when we thought it might give us an edge in the War on Terror. What's happening to civilians in Israel and Gaza is a tragedy, but it's going to KEEP HAPPENING until either every man, woman, and child in Gaza and the West Bank is dead or we're going to have to find a two-state solution that actually protects the territorial integrity of Gaza and the West Bank. And we can say ""but they're bloodthirsty terrorists and they don't deserve that"" but do they deserve to be exterminated? Because that's where we are.",2023-10-10 23:58:12,-1

comment,"I decompiled the Wahoo Eats app, and it's SO much worse than we all thought","Consider this somewhat of a PSA when using the Wahoo Eats app, as beyond its jank and performance, I got curious a couple days ago and decompiled an apk of the app. Security-wise...hoo boy, where do I even begin? TL;DR (for students): \- The app allows unencrypted (HTTP) traffic, meaning your login data, payment info, and other personal data could be intercepted, viewed, saved, stolen, etc. on a public Wi-Fi network (Edit for clarity: if you use it on eduroam you should(?) be somewhat okay because it's a private network and uses modern encryption in its validation, but all it takes is one person on their off-grounds house wifi to crumble this house of cards.) \- It uses custom deep links that are hijackable — another app on your phone could trick Wahoo Eats into handing over sensitive data. \- It stores and exposes various IDs, API keys, and session data that should never be client-side. \- Payment modules are built on fragile, copy-pasted validation code and pass session keys around in ways that are insecure. ...All this in an app students are forced to use for dining with no alternative. Important disclaimers: \- This was done only by decompiling the Android APK (publicly downloadable from the Play Store). \- I didn’t touch any backend servers, databases, or live systems. This is client-side only. \- I’m one person with some help from agent-assisted tooling and just one evening of investigation, so while the findings are solid, it’s not a comprehensive security audit and shouldn't be taken as definitive. \- I have not, and will not, attempt to exploit any of these issues (I cannot preface this enough.) I put together a technical document with evidence, risk analysis, and remediation steps. If you’re curious about the details (or want to forward this to someone who can fix it), it’s all in there. You can find the writeup here: [https://files.catbox.moe/za03f5.pdf](https://files.catbox.moe/za03f5.pdf) This post isn’t meant to dunk on the devs or play ""hacker vigilante."" My only intent here is to raise awareness of risks so students (and hopefully the school) know there are serious issues that need fixing, lest people want data being hacked, stolen, or leaked. ...Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaanyway, yeah, we can all agree that the app sucks in performance too. I didn't do that much digging in that regard, but I did find conflicting API and function calls that confuse the program, outdated/decayed libraries, and devtools left in the production environment. This app is just a mess all around, technically speaking (5 dollars says it was at least partially vibe coded). Okay, PSA over.",2025-09-04 16:44:50,228

You waste time turning on your leaders for not handing out tents fast enough after your homes are destroyed by missile strikes, on eachother, when you should be fully focusing your anger on whomever launched the missile in the first place. Ask yourself if you are actually angry about this and really think about it. Are you actually angry at Jim Ryan, or are you frustrated that nobody is coming to the rescue? Instead of denigrating the man anonymously, ask him for the resources to fight back, to support your righteous indignation, and to stage protests. Ask him for things under his purview to help you resist. There is a good chance that he shares your frustrations. This is happening on your watch too if you're just posting here and then continuing along your fruitless doom scroll. There is a reason why fascists have an interest in destroying higher education.

comment,UVA President Jim Ryan gives nothing burger speech regarding nation-wide education policy changes,"Take a look at how much of UVA’s research and health system budgets are funded through federal grants. The school can't afford dto lose them. And our General Counsel is part of the state Attorney General’s office so there won't be any legal help from that source to even put up a legal fight against federal requirements. Want to change things, this year there is a slight chance to tip the executive and legislative balance in Virginia to Democrats. Necxt year, if the worst predictions (in the minds of liberals) happen the better chance will be Democrats taking back the US House of Representatives or Senate. None of which will happen if the Democrats swing too far left in the primaries. Or if the far left sits out the elections in a snit because they would rather have the right in control than vote for a less than far left candidate.",2025-02-09 13:50:29,0

I'm sorry, you think theres a variety of opinions on whether the university should remain financially solvent and continuing a whole bunch of scientific/medical research? You can say there's a variety of opinions on say the role UVA should play in working with federal immigration officials regarding undocumented immigrants enrolled at the university. But this administration has taken actions to destroy the very foundations of higher education income streams. This current administration is trying to destroy how higher education, and thus UVA, has operated for decades. Institutionally, Ryan has to take a stand against this admin or the university will become a shell of itself. Thats not negotiatiable within the broader uva community",2025-02-08 12:47:51,2
comment,UVA President Jim Ryan gives nothing burger speech regarding nation-wide education policy changes,$1.1B in returns every year. Are we receiving more in funds or returns at this point? Use it to continue educating our students because that is what UVA is about. We were the first major university **ever** to be centered around a library rather than a chapel.

comment,A Message to New UVA Students,"younger based Muslim orgs are more likely to be accepting bc of shifts in attitudes among Americans in general.

Let’s be clear that there’s differences in the spaces we’re talking about (Christian or Muslim). For example, Mormon and jehovah’s witnesses had the lowest acceptance levels in 2014.

comment,give me my 24 hour libraries back,"One of the more eccentric economics professors at UVA was David McCord Wright. A Harvard-trained economist, Wright taught at the University from 1946 to 1955. Outspoken and, at times, intemperate, he was well-liked by students for his frankness and wit. One night around 1:00 a.m., Professor Wright realized he needed additional reference material and headed over to Alderman Library. To his dismay, he found the doors locked and the building closed. Undeterred, Wright returned to his home at No. 2 Dawson’s Row, retrieved an axe, and marched back to Alderman. He chopped out a panel of the front door, reached through, and unlatched the lock. After gathering the materials he needed, he left a note at the scene: ""Any good library should be left open all night. — David Wright""",2025-10-22 04:53:16,169
comment,give me my 24 hour libraries back,"Not to get up on a soapbox but this feels like one of those things that has a lot of significance when viewed retrospectively. In a very real sense the University **was** the library for decades. The Rotunda is the old UVA library -- before Alderman, before Clemons, before the annex that Echols burned down. The books and the space in which to learn from them is the beating heart of the University community. Students cycle through; faculty grow old and retire; but there are books buried deep in those stacks which are older than any living UVA graduate. I don't know that closing the library at night represents a retreat from knowledge but it does feel like a retreat from the idea that the pursuit of knowledge is the focus of our time at the University. But times change and the world changes with them. I expect someone said something similar when they moved the books out of the Rotunda.",2025-10-22 10:03:27,61

If it’s safety, I get it but the doors are locked after hours except for student IDs anyway. If it’s staffing, would modestly increasing the pay help? It would likely be justified anyway with inflation. If it’s lack of interest, I always saw at least a few people there late at night. They’d prefer to not study at home - UVA should give them a space place to do so. If it’s wanting to protect students from themselves and make them go home instead of lose that much sleep over studying, this is a perfect example of needing to let adults (if we still consider 18 the age of adulthood) make their own personal decisions for themselves.",2025-10-22 10:50:13,16

The library operating hours money and the uniforms and athletic facilities come out of two different fund sources under different control.

Dedicated fees, or dedicated endowment funds would come closer to getting the libraries in a level funding priority status with athletics.

It makes sense not to bring first years since in so many schools, they’ve been the ones to break quarantine and gather in HUGE groups. I’m not saying UVA first years aren’t responsible, but they haven’t gone through all of the honor code “coronations” and live through the culture of UVA. We haven’t had any huge outbreaks in cville yet and we’ve all been here for a bit. I’ve seen plenty of people everywhere wearing masks, and for the first time ever, block party wasn’t a huge thing. I’d say the people currently in cville are a pretty responsible crowd While I think UVA definitely cares about first years, money moves is DEFINITELY driving the decision. They make the most money off of them, with overpriced housing and forcing the most extensive dining plans on them. If UVA wanted to *ensure* no outbreak, they wouldn’t bring first years from all over the country into cramped dorms. It’s 100% ASKING for an outbreak for bringing them here. Even if they are responsible. Legitimately every other college that has brought back students have had to send them back While I agree that it sucks that they don’t have a “first year experience” a lot of fourth years are losing their last year because of covid, and first years have three more years to party it up and live life.",2020-08-29 01:17:25,18

While we all feel for low-income students, we also shouldn't necessarily force middle and upper middle class parents to burn through retirement savings and nest eggs just to fund a college education, possibly putting themselves in a precarious position should there be a loss of a parent, an unexpected medical or other issue, or a loss of a business or employment.",2025-06-02 09:35:06,0

Minimum wage has gone up 3x in VA. I do not feel sympathy for OOS students, especially when our in state flagship is prohibitively expensive to many, many families stuck in between Access UVA levels and full tuition level, who basically get no financial aid. The solution is not to cut programs that make UVA financially accessible to those who are academically ready but who cannot afford it. Perhaps the solution involves raising OOS tuition or lowering in state tuition. Whatever the solution is, a state flagship should NEVER cost an in state student $53k/yr all in. Ever.

It can go to 90% in-state, but it's excellence and gravitas in the country will surely drop. In fact, one of the reasons why UVA is better than UNC is because UNC takes too high a proportion of in-state students.

UVA receives so little in state support (and is so expensive for OOS students) that it probably should be a private institution. Then it wouldn’t have to kowtow to scummy politicians that place their non-education-loving, academic-freedom-hating pals on the BOV. Given how expensive UVA is for OOS students, we just wouldn’t allow our kids to go there. The actual Ivies were only $10-15K more, and are a good deal more prestigious. No brainer there for us. [I graduated in ‘88.

comment,"""First act was to announce that in-state undergraduates from families making less than $30,000 per year would receive scholarships covering tuition, room, and board""","$280 million isn't that much to be honest. It's the delta between oos and in-state tuition (\~$40k) for only 7000 ug students. In other words, you could take \*just\* the ug population, switch from 67% in state tuition to 27% in state tuition, and close that entire gap. (Yes, I recognize there is aid, etc. that affects the calculations, but you get my point) Btw, speaking as an out of state alum, one of the things that made me attend UVA over US News top 15 private schools to which I was accepted was the relative affordability of the oos cost. Back then, the cost of attendance for oos was \~58% of the cost of attendance for the top privates. Today it's closer to 90%. I'd have a much harder time recommending UVA to my kids solely for that reason, even though we are high income. The relative affordability for even oos students is one of the reasons a school like the University of Florida ($45k for oos) is screaming up the rankings. Even UT-Austin is more like $60-65k per year. And, again, speaking as an alum, one of the things that keeps UVA's ranking high is it's high caliber oos students. UVA's selectivity will suffer if it can't attract high quality oos students, as Virginia is not populous enough to maintain the same high quality at a high in-state % as a California or a Texas.",2025-06-02 14:51:22,1

comment,when the chem building is sus 😱🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣,"Taking the 1895 fire and Stanford White’s additions into consideration, there are some secret societies older than even the Rotunda and Southern Lawn. My point being UVA “let’s” them tag buildings because they play an important role in the history and many traditions of the university for the last 140ish years I can see how some people think we’ve outgrown the secret societies as a concept but on paper they do operate as philanthropic organizations and serve the university as a bridge between students and faculty. I don’t think anyone in administration considers the tagging of buildings (only the Z’s, 7’s, IMP’s, P.R.I. and Claw and Dagger?) as “defacing” Edit: I forgot the 21 Society and Pika’s F",2021-04-19 21:35:51,13

comment,when the chem building is sus 😱🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣,"I’m unsure what you’re alluding to with that last bit. Sure, traditions either evolve and grow, or die out over time as all things do. Anyone can donate money philanthropically and take credit for it, but that’s not very esoteric now is it? Another check to the registrar doesn’t contribute to the lore and legacy of the university. Again, no one at the university, either student, alumnus, or admin, sees the symbols as graffiti. As an alumnus(?) and townie, I hope you’ve joined the community at Lighting of the Lawn and seen the secret society’s symbols placed strategically around the Lawn in lights, or the student hillside at Scott Stadium where they’re set in stone. The most “present” of the societies, the 7’s and Z’s, have been around since 1892 and 1905, respectively. Eli Banana and TILKA are even older. To say the society’s symbols goes against the history or beauty of the university would be like saying “Old Cabell Hall ruins the history and view from the Lawn” just because it’s not original to the Academical Village. The secret societies are one of the many things that makes UVA, UVA, and the symbols are there as a constant reminder of their support and it is an honor to be recognized by them",2021-04-20 19:26:41,2

post,Students call for the University to reject the Trump administration’s Compact - The Cavalier Daily,"Students call for the University to reject the Trump administration’s Compact - The Cavalier Daily From Cav Daily article: >Clay Dickerson, Student Council president and fourth-year College student has joined student leaders of seven other universities, who were also sent the Compact, in a joint statement calling for their universities to reject it. These include the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the University of Arizona, Dartmouth College, the University of Pennsylvania, Brown University and Vanderbilt University. The statement writes that “as student representatives, we stand in united opposition to the outlined conditions.” >Dickerson cited several [provisions](https://www.cavalierdaily.com/article/2025/10/working-through-the-compact-point-by-point-here-is-what-uva-has-already-done) in the Compact that universities must abide by which would affect student life. These included, as Dickerson described, promoting a “marketplace of ideas,” limiting definitions of gender, revising University governance structures and committing to using lawful force against violent demonstrations. >Dickerson said that these provisions may affect student self-governance at the University, transgender community members and student protestors, among others. >“I think that it would be absurd if the University signed on to the Compact as it stands, especially from a student’s perspective,” Dickerson said. “\[The Compact\] would no doubt serve to the detriment of student life experience.”",2025-10-17 08:59:33,256

post,REPORT LUMPY POSTS,"REPORT LUMPY POSTS I’ll be messaging the mods separately, but I think this post is long overdue. I would appreciate if mods pin this so everyone can see this. If you come across a post by “Lumpy,” I strongly encourage you to report it immediately. For those unfamiliar, Lumpy is a troubled individual who repeatedly posts negative and inflammatory content, always targeting and villainizing the UVA student body. Despite being banned multiple times, he continues to create alternate accounts to bypass moderation and continue his behavior. There’s one clear hallmark of a Lumpy post: he consistently blames the entire UVA community for his loneliness and lack of social connections. This individual has single-handedly undermined the credibility of genuine users who sincerely seek help or struggle to make friends at UVA. Because of Lumpy’s repeated posts, there is now always a lingering doubt, such as “Is this a Lumpy post?” As a result, anyone writing about loneliness or social struggles often feels the need to preface their post with “I’m not Lumpy” just to be taken seriously. I also want to caution anyone with good intentions against reaching out to him. Over the years, many people have genuinely tried to connect with him and offer support, but to no avail. He has never followed through, and those who have challenged his behavior often receive disturbingly hostile messages in return. I know there are many people who were just accepted to UVA and may be new to this community. I want to assure to anyone new that the UVA community is NOTHING like lumpy describes. UVA is a wonderful place with a wonderful community and you’ll enjoy your time here. Edit: if anyone sees a lumpy post plz paste this message and report it Plz refer to this https://www.reddit.com/r/UVA/s/MNvpXouoXr. Do not engage with this.

There's a pretty significant threshold that has to be hit to do anything from the university's end. I'm sure they've been deemed not a threat by the threat assessment team at UVA, otherwise something would have been done. &nbsp; At this point, trolling Lumpy is annoying you more than it is annoying Lumpy.

comment,REPORT LUMPY POSTS,"It doesn’t work that way since he changes his username, you can’t do a search history. Also, those that don’t know it’s lumpy don’t understand so it’s as if each time there needs to be the PSA and then all the examples of people who have tried -so it doesn’t seem like people are just being mean. Somehow, all of the examples need to be included, rather than people posting and adding energy each time, but I don’t know how to do that. But I see what you’re saying -if this thread could be linked each time he posts (with an explanation) -then people could read the comments here. If we all commit to that and share our support for the original poster who puts up the PSA it might gain some traction. And it shouldn’t go unnoticed that the results of this thread, and the one after the suicide when people were talking about him means that he doesn’t post at all. So it’s the two times that he gets the thing he wants, which is people caring about him. The rest of the time he’s trying to get attention and that’s what needs to stop so more people don’t get sucked in. Each time there’s a post this original post to ignore him should be put up with link to the post comments and people should be told to ignore his post. Finally to stop this dynamic. For all those who think that we are mean, we’ve lived through two years of his constant negativity and attack attacks on the university and the students.

To surrender these core values in exchange for preferential federal funding would betray not only Jefferson's vision but also the faculty, students, alumni, and citizens of the Commonwealth who have supported and sustained this institution for more than two centuries,” wrote the senators. >The letter points out “internal contradictions” and “unworkable provisions” within the compact, as well as being an assault on the university’s autonomy. >Several groups on Grounds have already spoken in opposition of the compact, including the UVA Faculty Senate.",2025-10-08 17:21:45,256

comment,State Senate Democrats tell UVA to not consider education compact,"It still wouldn’t be easy to come up with $294 million in lost state appropriations while trying to keep education affordable. The medical school, law school, and Darden were able to go financially private in part because the market value of the degrees they offer is very high (and it’s my understanding that the medical school can generate revenue of its own). The market value of many undergrad degrees may not be high enough to hike tuition even more and expect grads who aren’t from wealthy backgrounds to be able to pay off their loans. I think there’s an immense value in us not being yet another elite private school.

comment,UVA football team repainted beta bridge last night,I'm an alumni who also didn't realize it had been so long since it was repainted. Perhaps the football team should leave it like this for a bit and then repaint it themselves. I don't see anything wrong with what happened though.,2024-04-26 22:31:15,36
comment,UVA football team repainted beta bridge last night,"I like that the football team continues to honor these fallen students, but isn't it high past time to build a permanent memorial? Beta Bridge has always had a history of being painted over regularly, and I would not be surprised if someone comes along to paint it again soon.",2024-04-26 15:08:34,141
comment,UVA football team repainted beta bridge last night,I’m an alumn and i was honestly shocked to hear it hadn’t been painted for a year +. Not really the purpose it’s served for decades. Unnamed people painting it blank in the middle of the night seemed like good as any way to move into a new chapter.,2024-04-26 20:50:19,80
comment,UVA football team repainted beta bridge last night,"Honestly the biggest issue was that the paint was falling off because nothing at beta bridge is meant to last for over a year. Being just about where the whole incident took place, I don't see any issue with a memorial persisting, I think the intended goal of getting rid of the taboo of touching it was partially achieved. The tragedy certainly won't be forgotten. I will say ""1 15 41"" doesn't need to take up the whole damn bridge but I'm really not worried about someone eventually deciding to do something about that one way or the other.",2024-04-26 22:58:33,24
comment,UVA football team repainted beta bridge last night,The bridge doesn’t belong to only the football team. The 17 society is correct that the Bridge should continue to live and change as the university community does.,2024-04-26 21:29:52,48
comment,UVA football team repainted beta bridge last night,"A proper, permanent memorial should be erected. Unfortunately, tragedies happen and will continue to happen, such is life. Beta bridge has had a unique role at the university for decades. I know it’s apples to oranges, but Yeardley Love’s murder didn’t occupy beta bridge for over a year. I don’t mean to diminish the deaths of these boys, but I personally don’t think monopolizing beta bridge is the way.",2024-04-27 01:31:11,19

comment,UVA football team repainted beta bridge last night,Surprised at the comments in here. 17 should’ve at least asked the football team or the family of the deceased. Tech students painted over the memorial for them.,2024-04-26 22:27:50,-11

comment,UVA football team repainted beta bridge last night,"Why? Historically, people never asked the prior group for permission to paint the bridge. Would you advocate the bridge be a permanent memorial like the football team seems to be acting? I'd be surprised if the football team or family ever suggest to paint over it, just as any group doesn't want their work painted over, but also knows it's going to happen.",2024-04-26 23:01:09,22

comment,UVA football team repainted beta bridge last night,"Nobody mentioned anything about a permanent memorial. Don’t put words in my mouth. You shouldn’t put a time limit on grief either. And 17 painting over it prematurely removes the option entirely of the football team or families ever painting over it, so I can’t answer to your last point. Why? Because three of our friends were MURDERED less than 1.5 years ago. Christ.",2024-04-26 23:12:49,-11
comment,UVA football team repainted beta bridge last night,"I don't intend to put words in your mouth. If my child was one of those murdered, I don't think I would ever agree to remove the memorial.

This has all kinds of manifestations, and it has all kinds of unfortunately obvious historical precedents. Timothy Snyder is a historian of Eastern Europe in the 20th century who has written exhaustively and persuasively on the parallels. And at this point I don’t think there can be any doubt that that’s the moment we’re in. So the question is: what do libraries do in this situation? 21st-century fascism is not just about governing through force. It’s also about surveillance. It’s about AI in the service of fascism, as a tool of surveillance. It’s about dismembering the public sector, through the Department of Government Evisceration. It’s about systematically erasing history, including data and primary source materials. This is foundational, for fascism—to distort the record or obscure it or simply deprive people of public data so that there is no independent source of fact. We’re seeing that right now. We’re also going to see more intimidation of individuals, more anti-union work, more anti-intellectualism, more loyalty tests, and on and on. What we’re experiencing in universities specifically right now is a concerted effort to bring us all to heel, and also to demonstrate that anybody who tugs on the leash will be dealt with harshly in public and persecuted in private. It’s not going to be an easy time for knowledge institutions, for public institutions, for libraries or for their leaders.""",2025-10-02 23:16:35,32

Secondly, universities have shut down, both openly and subversively, conservative speech for decades. This rings hollow and hyperbolic.

There are 50 universities on the US Department of Education’s list of universities that can expect to be investigated over 'anti-semitism'—and I have to put quotes around that, because I don’t accept the current equation of anti-semitism with any opposition to the policies of the Israeli government. I certainly hope that those universities are talking to each other and organizing and coordinating a game plan on the legal front and on the PR front. Collective action is really the only course of action here that makes any sense. And you can tell it makes sense, because there will be an effort to prevent it from happening. As a founding father once said, we must hang together, or most certainly we will hang separately. I think that has never been more true than at the present moment. So for people coming into the universities, people coming into libraries, look to your local, national, and international communities and be a contributing member to those communities. Organize with those communities. Don’t be an island. Don’t go it alone. There is strength in numbers.""",2025-10-03 08:42:06,14

When members of the government are doing Nazi salutes publicly or quoting Hitler, fascism seems like a fitting description. Universities invite conservative speakers all the time.

Also, prior to 1918 Germany had a constitutional monarchy. This made them prime for the evil fear-inducing population controls and dictatorship of Hitler. Unfortunately, the populace of our country has little support for its federal institutions, due to their frequent missteps and corruptions.

comment,IT'S HAPPENING,"So that motel was actually owned by my friends' parents.

They built a mini apartment into part of the motel and my brother and I used to always visit our friends there growing up. I remember it burning down, it was so sad cause of all the memories we had there. They didn't wanna sell it to UVA or the city cause it's one of the last memories of my friends' late granddad starting his life in the states.

post,Chinese International Students at UVA,"Chinese International Students at UVA Hello, fellow Asian international student here. **I understand this can be a sensitive topic and I do intend to make this post as respectful as possible, so let's try to keep it that way. :)** As an international student, I definitely found Charlottesville to be pretty eyeopening but also took some time for me to get used to. I have to admit, a lot of us Chinese internationals keep to ourselves and make friend groups for organizations strictly catered for internationals. We use WeChat to converse a lot in Chinese, and talk about things only amongst ourselves. Charlottesville is very different from major Chinese cities, and there were a lot of things that I had learned and got used to living in this what a lot of Americans call a ""college town"". I am generally a pretty shy person, and definitely felt more comfortable interacting with my small group of Chinese friends from Shenzhen. But I was curious about American students outside of my immediate group. I remember the first time we went to a football game and there was a lot of spirit in the game. We didn't understand the rules at all but had a good time. I think there is quite a cultural barrier and both Chinese and American students find it hard to befriend people across the ethnical aisle. I think I only interacted with American students in certain group projects, but not so much beyond that. One my Chinese friends actually made a conscious effort to befriend some of the so-called ""frat boy"" roommates we had as first years, and it was actually nice to cross this barrier. We are very much alike and we shared a lot of the same sense of humor. In addition, we did make slightly controversial jokes about our differences, but kept everything generally respectful and courteous and with good-intentions. Through him, I got to know a few great American students and got more out of my shell. I used to be nervous interacting with people outside of my immediate group, but now I feel more natural and also more of ""myself"" around American students. I was wondering if in the future of UVA, we could maybe start organizations or events that get Chinese students more integrated into American college culture. I know that there are some negative stereotypes about Chinese intl students at not just UVA but America in general, but we also have our stereotypes about American students too. We are culturally different and come from countries with very different political systems. The American media says a lot of terrible things about China, and so does the Chinese media on America. I think these differences can say a lot about our respective governments, but not our people. I think we can find ways to step out of comfort zones and make friends with each other more. I think this will foster a more unified UVA community and dispel some of the commonly held stereotypes we've had, which I think can be a beautiful thing! Edit: I remember back in Chinese high school, my history teacher showed us a video of President Ronald Reagan's speech at Tsinghua University. I liked the speech a lot, and our shared sense of humor really illustrates our commonalities. Then again, I feel like the laughter the Chinese students had at certain points of Reagan's speech was pretty orchestrated. I sympathize with those students- sometimes we are not sure how to act in front of different cultures, and it can be hard for us to not be awkward in foreign settings. I hope we can slowly become more natural with American humor and culture, as many of us plan to establish futures here and want to treat fellow Americans like regular, natural, and even long-term friends.

comment,Chinese International Students at UVA,"I think that there are lots of American students (including myself) that would like to see this happen. It’s a rare opportunity for me to meet someone from a foreign country, and there’s a lot of benefit from doing so. I’m a first year so I really have no suggestions right now as to how we might connect on a larger scale, but as another commenter said, maybe Global Greeters and Global Student Council are options. I will have to research those. Anyways, this post has inspired me to find out how to connect with international students, and I hope to meet you in the future!",2020-12-27 09:50:52,44
comment,Chinese International Students at UVA,"Hey! I’m glad you were able to befriend Americans (or just students unlike yourself in any way) through your time at uva. There are a lot of great cios that focus on cultural exchange, like global greeters and global student council. I know ppl in both, so if you’d like we could dm or others could send suggestions my way. I know it’s difficult to meet people who are different, so anyone (including Americans) can give their thoughts/suggestions",2020-12-27 08:27:43,27
comment,Chinese International Students at UVA,"I felt so so lonely here and I know it’s probably my own problem because some other fellow Chinese students are very social. But I never felt this lonely when I was in China. People would come up to me and ask how I was doing, but in my lab here in UVA, I have to ask for help to get into some conversation or else nobody would talk to me. American coworkers would gather together talk and laugh. I want to share the happiness but I don’t know how, plus I don’t understand them unless they slow down for me. I’m not afraid of jumping in and asking questions but I don’t want to ruin the enjoyable time with my questions so I have to laugh as if I understand what’s going on there. I hated myself for not being good at English, and now I just forgave myself. My brain turned on the protection mechanism so I don’t notice it when I don’t understand their words. I also have no friends. People are nice and would say call me if you want to chat. And I just don’t want to call anyone. I have been here for 2 years. I’ve been through 2 Christmas by myself and another Chinese New Years soon. I had suicidal thoughts and went to see a psychologist at student health. He said my symptoms are very normal among the international students here, especially among Chinese students. I thought right, it’s just some normal struggle that I have to overcome and it’ll get better. But it didn’t. Every time I had suicidal thoughts I told myself my mom would be sad and my family would be ashamed. I do feel the need to connect with people, not through bible study, not some party where Americans celebrate and we just huddle at a corner and stare at the campfire. You made a good suggestion that we should have an organization to help people fit in. We already have VISA, where native students meet with international students. However I don’t think that’s very helpful. Maybe good for my English speaking, but it didn’t get me any friends.",2020-12-27 10:47:30,26

comment,Chinese International Students at UVA,"I am sorry to hear that. I can understand your pain, it is difficult to make close foreign friends especially with the language gap. As an international student, I also share the struggle of not going home during certain breaks because home is so far away and it is too 麻烦 to take multiple flights, adjust to jetlag, etc. I didn't like only hanging out with international students that much, and I understand it feels weird going to an American party. Me and my other Chinese friend who didn't want to go just stood in a corner holding our drinks trying to figure out what we were supposed to do. I didn't really fit in with those crowds too much either. I've done some awkward things my first year to try to assimilate into American college life, and I think I made a fool of myself haha. Don't worry, it's hard for most Chinese internationals. That is why we all keep to ourselves, eat only with other fellow internationals, and only speak Chinese all the time outside of class. I don't like this, because it gives off the stereotype that we 老中 are rude and very group-oriented. My parents have also advised me to make more American friends if I didn't like hanging out only with fellow internationals. I'm a fourth year and graduating in May, but I'll be returning to Cville for my final semester. Obviously because of COVID, it'll be hard for us to get integrated because of the general lack of social activities but if you want, send me a DM and we exchange WeChat or LINE. We can probably hang out next semester. If you have suicidal tendencies, please do not hesitate to get help!",2020-12-27 11:19:26,7
comment,Chinese International Students at UVA,"Thats a great point! That would actually be a great way to learn one of the greatest elements of American culture, self determination! OP doesn't have to wait for the government or some organization to hear his pleas, he can just do it him/her self! There are channels where you can easily start a group at UVA. This spirit of individual leadership is one of the widest gaps between Chinese and American culture, so this would be an excellent way for OP to learn! I know some Chinese nationals who have been here for a long time (and are citizens now), and they said one of the most eye opening realizations they had in America, is that any individual can just start anything they want. Americans ""just do it"". This rarely occurs in China, and these friends say that is one of the things they learned to like best about America.",2020-12-27 13:30:35,4
comment,Chinese International Students at UVA,"Very interesting topic. From my personal experience the two groups don’t have much overlaps in social life. I think the key here for both group is that they’re fundamentally from different cultural background. In Chinese culture race and the notion of being accepted in a larger group plays a more important role (if you look Chinese you’re naturally closer and you’re likely to do so to avoid being excluded), whereas Asian Americans are typically grown up in the American way celebrating individuality. some of my Asian American friends have this identity crisis between their worldview and physical identity. Politics also plays a role but this depends on the political views of the parents.",2020-12-27 17:16:06,6
comment,Chinese International Students at UVA,"This is something rly interesting. There’s a CIO called Chinese Students Association (CSA) which are basically American Born Chinese, and then MSN for Mainland Student Network (MSN) for intl Chinese students. They don’t overlap each other a lot, but they did cohost some events in the past. I remember they had a “dating show” once like the bachelor show including members from different Asian communities, including VSA and KSA and OYFA I think. There’s also a culturalfest every year where students from CSA and intl Chinese student groups both perform.",2020-12-28 01:28:26,2

There is no place else I would have rather spent the last 3 and a half years. Don't get me wrong, UVA is not for everyone. And for those who don’t find their home at uva, I know there is a school out there for them. It can be overwhelming and although the school is quite big, you undoubtedly will feel alone at some point in your UVA career. To be completely honest, it can be kinda hard to get out there, but there are people and resources here to help you. Everyone goes through personal struggle, even if they seem like a person who never cries or gets down. Put yourself out there and buy into the system. Trust me. UVA was, and is, intense and challenging both academically and personally, but I wouldn’t trade it for the world if I was doing the college process all over. I am constantly impressed by the student body, professors, and other members of our UVA and Charlottesville communities. There is always some truth to the stereotypes. Yes, there are the preppy bros. Yes, there are pretentious assholes in JeffSoc. Yes, drinking at the school is a very visible pastime (it is at most colleges). Those are just facts of life at UVA, but they aren’t the full reality. Every break I can’t wait to get back to school and get back together with the UVA community that I’ve put work into being a part of. Everyone belongs here and you can find your people, just don’t give up. TLDR: Don’t listen to lumpy, uva is great :)",2023-12-24 02:54:06,242

comment,"To those in the class of 28, or those thinking about coming to UVA:","From a non lumpy perspective: I have not had a very good time here but not in the way lumpy describes it lol. Honestly, UVA was my only choice (which I was very privileged to have) but I just don’t think a college town environment not near any major cities like NYC or DC (like less then an hour) works very well for me. I like being near metropolitan areas what can I say! Also, I sometimes don’t feel like I fit in with the frat/drinking culture, but that’s a concern to have at any college.",2023-12-24 12:01:26,20

I’m also a current fourth year and I get sad every time I think about how close I am to saying goodbye to this place.

I can barely remember the bad days at all when I look back on the whole experience. I know I’m biased but even visiting friends at other schools makes me appreciate UVA more. The culture we’ve got here is special. To anyone considering UVA, just remember that the recent negativity has been perpetuated by an extremely vocal minority. We would love to have you!",2023-12-24 10:56:19,15
comment,"To those in the class of 28, or those thinking about coming to UVA:","I firmly believe there is a place at UVA for everyone. I didn't drink for half of my time there, never joined a fraternity or any of the other ""stereotyped"" groups, and I had a great time and made excellent friends. Not every moment was sunshine--life will always have its ups and downs. But if you give the place a chance and explore, I believe you'll find your spot. For people that are broadcasting negativity, I could think of a number of student groups that they could join that would probably be good for them. I've tried recommending these a few times and found the effort futile with at least some of these people. UVA, like with most things, is a ""you get out what you put in"" scenario.",2023-12-24 15:46:08,10

I knew one singular person that was going here (I knew *of* a few others, but I really only knew one), and the friends I have made here I know will last. Through clubs or classes or hanging out, the opportunities available to me have made for a truly enjoyable experience. My only wish thus far is that I got involved a little bit more, and I know I'll continue to do that. It is a (small) challenge making friends, that I know, but if you have the ability to keep on trucking and find enough people, you will do very well for yourself.

comment,"To those in the class of 28, or those thinking about coming to UVA:","My two cents- mileage will definitely vary from both extremes of the spectrum. I personally really liked my time at UVA and have lots of good memories from there, but I know some friends who absolutely hated it and one who had the means to transfer out to a different college. No shame in not liking the school. UVA is not for everyone, but there’s no perfect school that is for everyone anyway. The most important thing imo is to just do your own thing and enjoy your own company: find something you like doing through clubs or join a class you find interesting. You’ll be doing it for your own fulfillment, any friends you’ll make is just a nice bonus :) if after all of that you’re still not happy, then for sure reach out and get help. If you can transfer, then do so, but if you can’t, then try and find ways to ease your burden until graduation.

comment,"To those in the class of 28, or those thinking about coming to UVA:","This fails to address the major complaint about UVA. UVA generally tends to be a good experience for those who manage to find themselves a good friend group. Things might change up but its important to have a strong starting point. It is a relatively abysmal experience for those who don't. This shouldn't necessarily be that hard; however, one must realize that for those where everything works out nicely early you don't realize that that it only gets harder afterwards. Personally, I've found nothing magical about UVA its just a college with people in it, nor have I found anything especially bad except perhaps the tendency of the student body to turtle up in their friend groups. It feels a little bit too much like high school tbh. Although maybe this is more due to Charlottesville being more of a college town (at least the areas on can find UVA students) than I would have expected from a school in a big city.",2023-12-28 08:51:30,1
comment,"To those in the class of 28, or those thinking about coming to UVA:","Don’t listen to this post. They’re lying. There isn’t a place for everyone here at UVA. It’s Christmas break and I have 0 friends. I’m not looking forward to going back to that hell hole. Some of you will fit in, and some of you won’t (like me). My time here has been horrible. The people here are not the greatest, but if you’re looking for genuine friends, this isn’t the place for that. The only thing you’re going to make here is acquaintances. Friendships are so one sided here and it’s always up to YOU to put in the work for them. Others will not reciprocate. The amount of loneliness, isolation, and increase in depression is insane once you arrive here. Everyone already has their cliques, so there is really no room for you to make any true friends. Again, only acquaintances. So, for those of you like me, do not come here!! If I could do it all over again I would have gladly rejected UVA’s acceptance letter. I did not know it would make me this miserable. Also, all everyone does here is party and drink. So if you don’t do either of those (like me), best of luck trying to fit in. The academics suck and they have grad students teaching classes who can’t even teach properly, which is pathetic. Anyways, good luck to whatever you decide.",2023-12-24 05:47:25,-76

The food sucked; it was damn-near impossible to get on-grounds housing after your first year, and the frat parties all served shitty American beer. My understanding is that it snows less now. But seriously, I went from UVA to a life deep behind enemy lines in Blacksburg. My wife teaches at VT and I spend a lot of time with Hokies and Radford students these days. So, I can tell you all from experience that the negativity you're seeing on this sub is present across multiple campuses. College -- not just UVA -- is hard. Especially if you've spent your last 13 years in the same school system, you're stepping out of an environment in which you've pretty much known SOMEONE if not EVERYONE for more than a decade. For many students, this is their first time in an environment in which they have to start from scratch, without parents or institutions to create social opportunities. For many people this is a moment of extraordinary liberation; they find themselves and come to understand who they are in a new and profound way. For others though... it's a daily challenge. I would caution any college student against ascribing those difficulties to their institution when it is far more likely to be a consequence of the enormous social shift that is inherent to the college experience.",2023-12-24 13:13:49,16

If they admit fault and roll back restrictions, their authority as an administrative force is diminished and students will still violate restrictions. If they continue to clamp down on restrictions and make empty, corporate statements, people will lose trust in the administration and students will still violate restrictions.

comment,Anyone else laugh out loud at Dean Groves message?,"""Dear Undergraduate, Graduate, and Professional Students: Good morning. Thank you for everything you are doing to follow the enhanced public health measures temporarily adopted by the University last Tuesday. This message provides additional information related to those measures. ## Walking with Another Person to a Shared Destination A question that has arisen since last week concerns the ability to walk with others despite the temporary “no gatherings” restriction. Although the new enhanced measures do emphasize no gatherings, we’d like to clarify that walking with one other person – to attend an in-person class or obtain food, for example – is permitted under the current health and safety guidelines. It is essential that you are both masked and physically distanced by at least six feet. We ask that you please follow this guidance in the spirit in which it is intended – for walking with a friend or classmate to a shared destination. The “no gatherings” restrictions remain in place. We also ask that you strictly limit exposure to others in the surrounding community who may be more at risk from COVID during this temporary period, including not using local gyms given that our own IM-REC facilities are currently restricted from use. ## Leaving the Area to Return Home or Returning from Home We realize you may have returned home during this period. If you are thinking of going home, we hope you will reconsider. Leaving the area is not advised, given the potential of spreading the virus to family members and others. From a public health standpoint, it will be much better for you to remain here. If you are already home or ultimately decide to go home, you will need to be tested before returning. In addition, it will be important to follow other guidelines around the timing of prevalence testing once you return. All of these steps are aimed at stopping the spread of the virus. You also should update your mailing address in SIS to reflect your physical location. For more details on what to do if you go home, as well as if you return to the area after being home, please see the [coronavirus website](http://click.massmail.virginia.edu/?qs=e7da4d982e42da51b5f5d986cf18adc26fefb0751adf550962d0552f4dd65924455776889933c90269ebb5a169a04889bc059967bcef57de831edd457e6d8c52). ## Remaining Vigilant We understand the enhanced restrictions put in place last week have negatively impacted your University experience in an already challenging time. The truth is we continue to confront a virus in multiple variants that can indeed be fatal to many, and the long-term health consequences of which remain unknown for those who do contract it. The fact you may already have had COVID doesn’t excuse you from continuing to adhere to masking, social distancing, gathering limits and testing requirements. We have seen, both here and nationally, individuals who tested positive in the past and have once again tested positive many months later. The key is to restrict the spread of the virus while we await the availability of a vaccine available to all, which remains months away. ## Adhering to Isolation/Quarantine Guidelines We are testing students more frequently than in the fall semester, and this has allowed us to more quickly identify new cases and get students to isolate or quarantine faster. It is essential that you follow the strict guidelines for isolation and quarantine, including remaining in your assigned space (whether provided by the University or in your personal residence), having food brought to you rather than going out for it, and helping us prevent a wider spread. If we can get the current spike on a downward trend, as we were able to do with your commitment to enhanced restrictions when a spike came last September, we can loosen the current enhanced measures more quickly. We know this is a difficult and challenging time, with “COVID fatigue” shared by many. However, we have to work together to get this under control. Thank you for continuing to summon strength, grace, and endurance in facing the continued threat posed by COVID-19. Sincerely, Allen W. Groves University Dean of Students""",2021-02-24 13:33:44,53

comment,Always be aware of your surroundings when peacefully protesting for your fucking rights,"There are thousands of cases since 2020 of police committing violence unprompted. If you think that plain clothes cops are hiding their identity so they can maintain order, I think you need to think about that one a little harder. Edit: 40,000 payouts in 10 years but hey it’s okay you can stick your head in the sand all you want. https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/interactive/2022/police-misconduct-repeated-settlements/ Edit2 since I'm no longer allowed to make comments in this thread: I appreciate you taking a critical eye and providing your own analysis. The first thing I will state is that 11k officers is quite literally ""thousands of cases"" which I know you didn't dispute. Even spread out over 10 years across all 50 states, and making the silly assumption that these people only did one bad thing each...is still a significant amount of police abuse of the public. The next point I'll make is that using the 1% thing isn’t really a defense of their conduct when the other 99% of the institution exists to defend the 1%. Bad officers overwhelming avoid any kind of personal financial accountability due to qualified immunity, they avoid career impacts by virtue of intra-department corruption and absurd union contracts, often receiving token disciplinary actions, and in many cases are quietly promoted, or otherwise they can pack up and start at a new department without any issues. You might have a point if that 1% faced any kind of accountability from their peers. But in fact their peers just operate the ecosystem that defends them and allows them to abuse the public. Real change will come from ending qualified immunity, putting pressure on local politicians who vote on the union contracts with municipal police, and from de-militarizing our departments. None of that is really happening at any kind of meaningful scale. And until it does, trust the police at your own risk. A small but meaningful anecdote is that when the national guard shot the students at Kent State, the public overwhelmingly sided with the police and blamed the students for getting shot. Pretty bonkers stuff and it’s always interesting to watch history recycle itself.",2025-03-26 08:10:11,31

comment,Always be aware of your surroundings when peacefully protesting for your fucking rights,"I'm not pro police but you're using numbers to make a point while leaving out scale for perspective. I don't have a wapo subscription but it looks like they're highlighting ~11,000 officers with multiple violations. This is terrible and these officers should face serious consequences for this and never allowed to be in a position of power again, nor anyone who is enabling them. There are more than 1,200,000 police officers in the United States so that 11,000 represents less than one percent of police. There are major problems with police but calling out 1% to demonize the other 99% isn't much of a flex. I know I'm a ""boot licker"" for daring to challenge this narrative but I'd rather acknowledge the reality that not 100% of police are inherently bad or violent based off of the actions of 1% which is the same logic used by the GOP to justify deportations and many other horrible actions.",2025-03-26 08:56:39,22

Sure, I'm willing to believe that, but not ""thousands of cases"". This is why I said you will ""likely"" be just fine, not 100%, but likely. Plain clothes police are in plain clothes for a variety of reasons, not the least of which are because of people like you who think they are the enemy and will act aggressively towards them and make them the target of your anger. In other words, the plain clothes police officers are used in events like this because they want to be available just in case something happens while allowing the protest to proceed and focused on its intended message. Being in plain clothes, they have less protection from both equipment and the law - they put themselves at a disadvantage in order to better keep the peace. Note that your idiotic logic is the same argument used by the January 6th rioters/insurrectionists about the plain clothes officers who folded themselves in to the crowd in an attempt to provide order.",2025-03-26 08:17:41,-7

post,Concerned about Lumpy; Part 2,"Concerned about Lumpy; Part 2 Last time I posted on here I shared that I felt concern for a student (whose identity I now know well) and their ongoing hostile behavior. It quickly became evident that hundreds of others were aware of this situation as well or had been targets of this person’s online. Since then numerous reports have been made with the university, both with deans and UPD alike. Other than the student attending a CAPS appointment, NOTHING has been done. His behavior is toxic, violent, and targeted toward others online on a daily basis, particularly anyone who expresses that they enjoy the university (or at bare minimum, exist peacefully here). Some days he is more volatile than others. Recently, he has begun making claims of hating professors, hating the community, and hating “everyone” at the university. This is not normal and it is not safe. He is persistent. He has been banned from this subreddit at least four times due to the nature of his posts. This student is a first year, and failing academically. He spends all of his free time targeting other students online, unleashing vitriol and hate. Initially I like many others had given him the full benefit of the doubt, assuming he meant well and that his claims of being friendless were due to being a young person in a new place. I WAS WRONG. He is an unkind individual, mean spirited, and aggressive. He touts free speech and “just swearing” as excuses for his actions. He has attempted to dox other students who have met up with him in an attempt to build bridges. The behavior is urgently worrisome at best. As his behaviors online grow increasingly persistent, threatening in nature, and frequent, many of us grow increasingly uneasy with the lack of repercussions faced by him. I am reluctant to name him as I wish for his safety, but I also know that others likely should be aware of how this person acts. Truthfully I am conflicted. I just want everyone to be safe, happy, and free from being targeted online. Though JustReportIt and UPD are good tools, as is the threat assessment method UVA uses, they have seemingly failed.

comment,Concerned about Lumpy; Part 2,"Thank you for making this post. From what I’ve seen, the community has made attempts to pull him out of this corner where he thinks “everyone hates him”. You definitely have a legit concern about him being potentially violent, and my best response (albeit cynical) is to document everything that he’s said before it’s taken down in case an event does happen, because I’m sure the UVA subreddit and YikYak will take his posts down only then. This is not to say that we treat him in any shape as hostile, because that’ll only feed in to the narrative that everyone hates him. It would be an arduous task to both push him to get mental health and document these potential warning signs, but it’s only possible if there’s someone like you (who knows him personally) to do it.

Keep doing what you're doing--take screenshots before they get removed, report through every possible channel, and use the screenshots as evidence. I hope someone takes it seriously, but if nothing else the UVA community seems to have enough evidence to support a pattern of behavior in these reports--if you haven't used the phrase ""continued pattern of concerning behavior"" or something along those lines, perhaps add that next time. Be safe out there, Hoos. And in the event that this Lumpy person sees it: please get help. I'm sure you're hurting. Not doing well in college is HARD.

Instead of fighting the DOJ's unfounded allegations and improper demands to remove the President Ryan, some members of the Board of Visitors were likely working with the DOJ, America First Legal Foundation, and Jefferson Council to push out President Ryan.

comment,"New York Times: ""What the University of Virginia Should Have Done"" (Guest Essay)","**New York Times Opinion: ""What the University of Virginia Should Have Done""** **By Timothy J. Heaphy** Mr. Heaphy is the former university counsel for the University of Virginia. LINK: https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/30/opinion/university-of-virginia-doj-trump.html *""On Friday, Jim Ryan stood on the lawn of Carr’s Hill, the residence of the president of the University of Virginia, alone in the center of a crowd of supporters. He offered brief remarks about his inability to fight the forces arrayed against him, including the Trump administration. No one stood alongside him — it was just the university president, Mr. Ryan, explaining why he had made the difficult decision to quit.* *The moment perfectly illustrated how Mr. Ryan was abandoned by the same people who were supposed to protect the university. **Under investigation by the Justice Department, the university had a strong defense, if only it had the courage to assert it. Instead of fighting back against what I believe to be false accusations that the university was violating federal law, and the even more outrageous demand that Mr. Ryan resign as a remedy for those alleged violations, the university’s Board of Visitors pushed out a popular president. Instead of presenting facts and law, the board waved the white flag of surrender. Mr. Ryan’s resignation is a victory for intimidation and fear over the rule of law.""*** ... *""While the university’s compliance with Title VI is clear to me, it was challenged by the Justice Department. Informed by the advocacy of the America First Legal Foundation, an organization founded by the current White House deputy chief of staff, Stephen Miller, the department alleged that the university’s compliance efforts were insufficient, a mere relabeling of D.E.I. programs that broke the law. The department’s proposed remedy was the resignation of the university’s leader — a shocking move that reveals the personal animus behind the investigation. The administration would rather oust a leader than force compliance with a particular policy.* *The hammer wielded by the Justice Department was the potential cessation of federal grant funding. The university had viable legal options to block this effort, too. Harvard University has persuasively argued that the university has a First Amendment right to pursue programs that promote a broadly diverse community and deserves due process before grants are removed. While the Harvard case remains pending, most higher education lawyers predict success for the university.* *Instead of asserting these valid defenses, the University of Virginia opted to capitulate to the demand for Mr. Ryan’s resignation, tacitly agreeing with the notion that the university somehow engaged in illegal racial discrimination.* *Why? By law, the university and all state agencies are represented by the attorney general of Virginia. The current attorney general has been an outspoken opponent of D.E.I. programs. He joined Virginia’s governor, Glenn Youngkin, in applauding the university’s dismantling of D.E.I. programs in March 2025. **This means rather than having an advocate loyal to the university and its interests, Mr. Ryan and the university were saddled with counsel aligned with the other side.* *The university’s governing board took a similar position. The majority of the current board was appointed by Mr. Youngkin, who has said, 'D.E.I. is done at the University of Virginia.' **In failing to assert these valid legal defenses, the board abdicated its responsibility to protect the university and defend it against unfounded allegations.""*** ... *""Mr. Ryan was known to urge the university to be both 'great and good' in all its endeavors. His departure will result in a less inclusive university community, which will harm all students who choose the University of Virginia. It is a sad day for the university, which will suffer the consequences of this bad decision.""*",2025-06-30 07:44:31,50

comment,"New York Times: ""What the University of Virginia Should Have Done"" (Guest Essay)","Despite what Mr. Heaphy says, DEI is discriminatory as it promotes ""equity"" as opposed to ""equitable."" At UVA, it was discriminatory and also resulted in administrative bloat, costing millions of dollars. President Trump and Governor Youngkin set about to eliminate DEI, and UVA ""complied"", but only relabeled it and never fired a single DEI employee. More and more BOV members have been questioning this, urging that the DEI salaries should be eliminated and applied to reduce tuition costs. Ryan stonewalled and never showed the BOV (or anyone else) how DEI and attendant salaries were being eliminated. The BOV was going to fire him anyway after Youngkin appointed the next round of BOV members in July. Ryan knew this and opted to resign in order to be fawned over and considered a martyr. Don't cry for Ryan--he is smart and cunning. If he wishes, he can become a tenured UVA professor at 75% of his huge salary. But I doubt he will choose this option, as I am betting his application for President of Harvard has risen to the top of the list. Whereever he goes, he will (and should) take JJ Wagner Davis with him. She is so full of hubris now that she regularly disparages BOV members publicly, and Ryan never reprimands her.

post,WTF,"WTF I honestly think closing libraries and gyms is some of the evilest shit that UVA could do right now. For most of us, we can only really find meaning right now by studying/ working out and now even that is being taken away from us. It's just straight up insulting because we all fucking know what the (major) source is: Greek life. I know I got on this sub and tried to say something about ppl freaking out abt the Madbowl snowball situation, but holy shit seeing 10000 girls post pics of bid day and hearing about all these bid day parties (someone told me about a 200 person party).... I am infuriated... especially beecause Jim Ryan wouldn't even say the words ""greek life"" ""ifc"" or ""frat"" in the god damned email. Like, how hard is it actually to simply enforce covid regulations on fraternities?? Idk this rant is annoying but the solutions seem to be so simple, yet admin resorts to clearly ineffectual measures that will simply make students more depressed and tbh probably encourage people to go out. Everyone I am talking to is just extremely burned out from Zoom University and now we can't even step outside without feeling like a criminal because people thought 10 beers in a basement was worth it to blatently break guidelines. I just wish there was something I/ we could do to actually change something becuase feeling powerless sucks. The email yesterday was just really such a big slap in the face that I couldn't believe it. Esp knowing that Jim Ryan makes 700k/ year to say shit like this makes me sick to my stomach especially as a TA making $150/ week. Rant over",2021-02-17 12:14:49,229
comment,WTF,"Here’s an explanation. I don’t think it’s complete but I think it gets you a long way. Usually the answer to “why is my college doing [thing I don’t like]” is insurance and legal liability. That’s going on here. If someone gets a severe case or dies of covid they/their parents very well may sue UVA because UVA has deep pockets. To successfully sue UVA (I.e. win a jury trial or get a settlement) the infected student would need to show that UVA had negligently done something that foreseeably *caused* the student’s injuries. So if they have a spike in cases and UVA *doesn’t* tighten restrictions, and then after that somebody (who was following all the rules/doing everything right themselves) gets sick at UVA’s gym or library, then they could maybe convince a jury that UVA caused this, and UVA would have to pay a bunch of money to make it go away. But if UVA shuts down the gyms and a student whose mental health was hanging by a thread subsequently harms themselves and *their* parents sue, then it’s significantly harder to prove that UVA caused it. The link there is way more attenuated because for example, the person was already depressed, maybe they had a history of this, and there’s a lot going on in the world right now besides UVA’s restrictions. And at any rate a jury/judge is gonna say it was “reasonable” for UVA to shut down in this way after a spike. So I agree. From a broader public health standpoint it makes little sense to close the gyms and libraries. They’re not major vehicles for transmission and a lot of people are leaning on them right now. But if your primary goal is to cover your ass, then you’d follow UVA’s playbook.",2021-02-17 18:05:02,36

comment,UVA reports more than $60 million worth of research grants terminated,"UVA Health in general plays an outsized role in providing advanced healthcare to much of SW VA. The affiliation with academics has made it possible for a much more robust hospital system to exist in Charlottesville than local economics would ordinarily provide, and as such lots of patients travel hours from around the state to get seen there. Many of them are the ones benefiting from the experimental medical treatments funded by some of these grants. As for childcare services, early childhood development is a target area where negative social determinants including lack of access can be most detrimental to future health. It makes sense that an academic medical institution with a community health focus would have a vested interest in funding similar social programs.",2025-05-05 00:14:51,4

Exceptional recommendation from a counselor stating I was one of the best in her decade career. Multiple state/national awards, leadership positions, and internships in high school and college. But had one C from extenuating health circumstances which caused my first semester to be a 3.5 college GPA (rest all As) but I submitted my mid term that showed my second semester 4.0 college GPA and acceptance into prestigious research. Worked so hard on my essay talking about my passion about specific aspects of UVA like location and its research. All this just for a rejection. Not even a wait-list. I am shocked, horrified, and sad at this. I feel that no one will ever care and recognize my hard work. I feel absolutely hopeless for my remaining colleges.

comment,Senate Democratic leader warns University of Virginia not to pick a new president ‘anytime soon’,"The role of the Virginia attorney general is under-appreciated in this situation. In a functional system, UVA and/or the state of Virginia would be suing the Justice Department for recent actions. So, why is that not happening? The general counsel for UVA is appointed by the AG and serves at the pleasure of the AG. (That’s why UVA got a new general counsel in 2022.) If the AG (a politician) does not want to sue, then no lawsuit happens. If we are talking about reforming self governance at UVA, the conflict of interest in the UVA general counsel is at least as big as the other issues discussed in this article.",2025-07-01 10:19:59,92

comment,Senate Democratic leader warns University of Virginia not to pick a new president ‘anytime soon’,Yup. An outcome of this has to be that UVA is allowed to self-source representation. And it goes further to the BOV as well - the president should be authorized to seek counsel without BOV approval as well.,2025-07-01 10:34:20,28
comment,Senate Democratic leader warns University of Virginia not to pick a new president ‘anytime soon’,"just privatize the fucking school already. if you want to be a globally prestigious university, staying chained to the whims of Virginia politics (inherently a conservative population, especially on a global scale) isn't doing you any favors.",2025-07-01 10:37:25,20

comment,Senate Democratic leader warns University of Virginia not to pick a new president ‘anytime soon’,I see that you graduated in 2002. UVA has changed alot since then. I would argue its a liberal school now (the students voted to divest from Israel).

comment,Shameful: University of Virginia agrees to Trump administration demands over admissions and hiring,"Thanks for putting out the actual text, this is super helpful and I think you're spot on. What UVA gets out of this deal is a hope that it will all be forgotten about and the DOJ will move on to other stuff. I think it's somewhat of a fool's hope, but I'm sure Mahoney is just thinking that this takes the heat off for now and maybe we just coast through. The problem is that the internal desire to ""take the heat off"" will likely mean that UVA will act in ways it otherwise wouldn't to appease this administration--namely reducing admissions of black students and other minorities and new rules that hurt our transgender students. Because, as you say, the DOJ may come screaming back in at any moment.",2025-10-23 10:30:41,29
comment,Shameful: University of Virginia agrees to Trump administration demands over admissions and hiring,"Just to be clear: isn’t that the status quo for every organization at all times?

comment,Shameful: University of Virginia agrees to Trump administration demands over admissions and hiring,"You realize that the DOJ could bring such an investigation at any time, regardless of whether we entered into this agreement, right?

comment,Shameful: University of Virginia agrees to Trump administration demands over admissions and hiring,">it’s objectively a win for UVA and calling it shameful is weird and kind of out of touch. really the only reason to even call it a deal is to help Trump save face, UVA hardly has to do anything. The agreement restores neither the funding nor the programs that were struck down, and every quarter, we will affirm that we are doing exactly what the DoJ wanted.

comment,Shameful: University of Virginia agrees to Trump administration demands over admissions and hiring,"Thank you, and yes: it very much feels like out of the frying pan and into the fire. Putting your head down and playing nice (with no binding assurances from the Feds, mind you!) *may* take the pressure off for now, but is not a long-term strategy. Mahoney should know better. U*nless* he is playing both sides. That's a separate yet related discussion, but I'm of the mind that while Mahoney agrees ideologically with the current administration, he can't fully hitch UVA to the Trump bandwagon for institutional reasons. (I have no concrete proof of this, but looking at Mahoney's scholarly research, his deep involvement with The Federalist Society, and his political donation records, I detect a pattern.)",2025-10-23 10:47:30,5
comment,Shameful: University of Virginia agrees to Trump administration demands over admissions and hiring,"The fact that prosecutorial discretion exists or that the DOJ's mandate is to prosecute is not really the point.

comment,Shameful: University of Virginia agrees to Trump administration demands over admissions and hiring,"I think he is trying to get UVA through things, and yeah I think that means trying as best he can to ""play it down the middle"" until we have a settled Board and settled permanent president.

I still think deal will, in the end, leave UVA in a worse place than if we lived in a sane world.

comment,Shameful: University of Virginia agrees to Trump administration demands over admissions and hiring,"Because it's nothing at all compared to the Compact, or compared to the deals that other schools made that included a payoff to the federal government. UVA has agreed to self-report compliance with a SCOTUS decision that the university is legally required to comply with. Now, I hate that decision (and the SCOTUS majority) -- but we're bound to it, regardless. An agreement that we'll send a quarterly report card to the federal government, and they'll stay off our backs? Best possible real-world outcome. And, don't forget -- a future BOV or President could modify or rescind this agreement, if they so chose.",2025-10-23 09:17:16,39

comment,Shameful: University of Virginia agrees to Trump administration demands over admissions and hiring,"Okay: Section 7 of the new agreement states UVA will follow the DOJ's June directive on what constitutes a violation of Title IX. That DOJ document (in Section C, part 1) states any school that lets trans people use the bathroom or play on a sports team other than the one aligned with their birth certificate will lose their funding. You have to read the documents that the agreement references to understand what it means.",2025-10-23 12:57:45,6
comment,Shameful: University of Virginia agrees to Trump administration demands over admissions and hiring,"Your last two points also go the other way--the federal government can declare UVA in violation and resume the ""investigations"" at any time. The DOJ is currently motivated by animus and is frankly a loose cannon, I don't know how anyone can really expect that the feds will call this a done deal and never come back to it. All it takes is a round of admissions that let in ""too many"" black students or a single complaint about a transgender student to blow this whole thing out of the water. I think that's a legitimate worry--that the university will very strictly self-police in legitimately bad ways to avoid anything getting into the report. Don't forget, UVA isn't making its own decision about what is and isn't allowed under the SCOTUS decision--it's promising to follow the feds' own guidance about what it means, which is of course slanted in one direction as far as they can possibly take it. UVA has given up its autonomy in that respect. This arrangement is far better than others in similar positions, but UVA is still on the hook and you can only hope and pray that it will be forgotten about. I wouldn't waste my breath trying to convince everyone else that they must be overreacting. It's pretty bad (but not worst-case-scenario) no matter what way you slice it.",2025-10-23 10:25:35,8
