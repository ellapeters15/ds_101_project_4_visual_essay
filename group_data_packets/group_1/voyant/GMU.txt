Trump Orders Schools, Colleges to End DEI or Lose Federal Funding

One of GMU’s greatest advantages is its diversity. I have learned so much more, academically and culturally, by being surrounded by and interacting with people who come from different backgrounds than I do. I still have not heard a valid reason as to why diversity, equity, and inclusion are bad things. Edit: it’s crazy to me that people who have responded to me and DM’d me and blocked me can attend one of the most diverse schools in the country and still feel such immense fear in their hearts. You are surrounded by some of the brightest, kindest, funniest, most caring and welcoming students and faculty I’ve ever had the pleasure of working and studying with in my 35 years on this planet. But you are terrified of them because they don’t look like you, or live like you, or worship like you. That’s a skill issue on your part. Everyone deserves to share this space, and learn, and grow, and succeed, and fail, and laugh, and cry, and make friends, and feel loved and included. DEI programs exist to protect that right.

Since GMU is a public university and has Title 9 and DEI policies, how screwed is it with the new administration?

BTW, the stated reason for ending telework for federal employees is that it’s “not fair that federal employees get to telework when private sector employees have to go in to work.” And what’s a synonym for fair? Equitable.

This will affect both private and public universities/colleges. Yikes.

Ugh, how did this man become a president again?

Preferring applicants based on the color of their skin or sexual identity should not be part of government policy. You either agree or disagree. Go through all the mental gymnastics you want but thats what it comes down to.

DEI shouldn’t be the goal anyways. Schools shouldn’t discriminate based on race.

Based. I love Mason’s diversity, but forcing it for arbitrary reasons is detrimental.

i honestly think being exposed to so many different people with different opinions, beliefs, and backgrounds has helped me in developing the social skills necessary to be in the workforce. it’s such a loss to lose departments that can help reinforce gmu’s mission for diversity

I wonder what President Gregory Washington will say about all of this and what the implications for this situation would be for GMU moving forward.

They create teachable moments, educate the generally astute in things other than book learning, and create a more empathetic populace which in turn creates more opportunitiea to explore in subsequent generations. This by contrast opposes the GOP and Corporate Fascist State of America who need a dumb, stupid, angry, and untrusting populace led by Supreme Leader to work, die, and create untold prosperity for our suppoaed 'Betters' because they all view themselves as kings in suits rather than human like the rest of us. And they prey on Tolerance, another aspect taught from DEI, so it also requires them to control the main religious perspective through bribery, extortion, creating your own State Sanctioned religion, or political appointment (See Church of England for many of the above) to preach a 'heavenly reward' for earthly suffering. Which is coincidentially in Christian narratives as serving God for all eternity. They want the willing, stupid, and hale to work themselves dead and they'll take care of the rest through 'legal' means.

The Republican Party, especially the Trump loyalists thrive on their followers being uneducated and unwilling to learn or experience anything outside of their bubble. They don’t want them to learn more, academically or culturally.

GMU is likely to keep their diversity, if not become more diverse because of this. GMU is diverse not because of DEI programs like affirmative action, but because they employ a different philosophical strategy from other comparably prestigious universities. Most schools are strict in their admissions but once you get in you’re almost guaranteed to graduate. Getting accepted to UVA or William and Mary is more impressive than graduating. GMU is diverse because they have low standards for admission across the board. A 2.3 high school GPA and a 1000 SAT will get you in (excluding certain departments like dance.) However once you get in the classes are difficult and you have to prove yourself in order to pass everything and graduate.

The diversity has nothing to do with these programs. GMU has been diverse for a very long time.

I'm going to be real. Seeing some people of color during college doesn't mean you have been surrounded by their culture lol. I don't agree with the changes, but if you think you have a greater understanding of how the world works because you interacted with the top 14% of educated people, you're sadly mistaken lol

As an army brat growing up in incredibly diverse environments from 1980-1998 I can say the one true gift of being a third culture kid was the amount of diversity I was exposed to. From other countries’ cultures and people to the military’s own social structures (enlisted and commissioned kids had very different backgrounds but we all went to the same schools), when I landed in America for college I was shocked at the de facto economic and racial segregation in our country. Truly. White dorms and white fraternities. White sections at sporting events. White bars and clubs. If you told me then they were working on a program to help break these molds I’d be all for it back then. I’m all for it today. What’s happening today around DEI (and every other identity politic) are a series of over corrections that will send us back to the 50’s. It’s un-American and I won’t take part. We are not defined by our government, our government is defined by us. They can’t tell us who we are, we need to remember it is *us* who determines who *they* are. Fuck fascism.

>I still have not heard a valid reason as to why diversity, equity, and inclusion are bad things. My company recently had a vendor come in an old do some DEI training through a series of small groups these past couple months and one of the questions asked in my group was.aboitvwhat evidence there was about positive impacts from DEI initiatives. The facilitator gladly shared examples from several companies, both large nationally known as well as large but local companies in the area, where DEI had a net positive effect afterwards on areas that certain people only care about (i.e., profitability).

The argument is that people’s merit and ability to perform is not considered when making a choice for a student, employee, etc. Only of the color of their skin or where they came from is considered. Obviously, this doesn’t matter and you can have both. The solution isn’t to completely get rid of it because clearly there was a problem or it wouldn’t have been implemented in the first place.

Because it promotes unnatural diversity. Rather than everyone regardless of race/gender being valued on merit, it places in quotas. >DEI programs exist to protect that right. No, title 9 programs do, and have for the longest time.

So the 100 Asians with better test scores , grades and extracurricular activities should be denied that experience because the color of their skin / heritage?

forced diversity is bad

Diversity is great when it’s not forced.

Blocked, you dont represent to the GMU people at all. You are spreading propaganda.

Well…if anyone did, unfortunately they would be banned. Regardless if it made sense or not.

Because the Department of Education falls under the executive branch, and the president has the power to enforce anything within the executive branch. I'll let you decide the answer to that. GMU does not have a much of a choice u less it has an unlimited budget from somewhere else. If Trump puts Mason on its list of schools to stop funding, I don't think the board of visitors would put up a fight

Someone get Elon Musk on the phone, because I’m a private sector employee and I work remotely. Around 40% of US employees are hybrid or WFH - same as the federal government, doofus

That’s not all DEI is. I work in the Student DEI office at George Mason, it’s literally just supporting people from different back ground. I work there because I am a first generation student with high school drop out parents from rural Virginia who didn’t know the first thing about college. The office are the people who helped me though

Here’s the thing. People, almost all of them, are more comfortable being with and picking people like them. Whether it’s common experiences or similar values or something else it’s basically human nature. But we live in a complex community with lots of groups and subgroups. Consciously and subconsciously we break folks into groups for convenience. Then we have an affinity for the ones like us. Without some structure there’s no effective way to prevent all that bias from contributing to everyday decisions including who to hire. In a nutshell killing DEI is removing that structure and promoting the return to nepotism and old boy clubs in hiring and other decision making.

400 years of slavery and yet you pretend like it has no effect today. You’re the one with the mental gymnastics, 🤣

Omg you all just use the same talking points and clearly have no idea what you’re even talking about. It’s not even funny anymore, it’s infuriating.

It’s only been like 5 or 6 generations since literal slavery, let alone the Jim Crow era. I don’t understand how you’ve convinced yourself that we live in some sort of post-discrimination utopia. Like why are white men overrepresented in congress versus the actual US population? Why are the 10 richest men all white? Is your assumption that women and people of color are inferior or do you just think they’re lazy?

DEI programs are not equal opportunity programs or quotas on hiring. I wish conservatives would stop confusing the two and wish liberals would stop using the able to enforce those sorts of policies. It is all about treating people with respect even if they have different backgrounds.

But why. If I have two equally qualified candidates why can’t a pick the female in order to make my school more diverse?

You have no idea how these policies work.

This. Also a bad look that businesses and colleges have resource groups for every single demographic group except white males. Shows who is being excluded by the “inclusivity”.

An hour ago, I saw an army of delivery bots trying to get through the snow

with that much snow they should cancel Wednesday and Thursday

What a cinematic shot 😂 godspeed little buddies!

This is powerful😖

While the school closes, they march for they know not why humans fear the cold, because they cannot feel anything.

The horde is coming

I believe in you bots!

Your posts on this sub are always amazing 🤩

AUTOBOTS. ROLL OUT.

Brave lil robots 🥹🥹🥹

They're trying their best.

The real mvps

They were trying to make their move while the weather concealed their formation.

Did they make it?

Is this in the USA? I legitimately have never heard of such a thing?

reminds me of the beginning of Charlie and the Chocolate factory

They should convert them to tracked treads instead of wheels during snowy conditions!

Those are surveillance robots, not delivery

They will but last minute

Why do they do this??

To laugh at commuters from their desks

*desks in their home offices

Saw this on the way to class

They speak for us all

Dude has a point about employees being made to pay for their own parking. Always thought that was pretty bizarre for a university. I worked at a few different universities for REUs and there was never a time where faculty/staff (including research interns) were made to pay for parking. I work at a college right now and I haven't paid a cent for it in many years.

they're just saying what is on everyone's mind tbh

Hear, hear.

so fucking real, he’s preaching to the choir

bro was just in a silly goofy mood

Well.. they have a point

They are not wrong

POV: College student at <INSERT UNIVERSITY> does not like <INSERT UNIVERSITY>’s parking services

Biggest reason why I'm all online this semester

"Most people rejected his message. They hated Jesus because he spoke the truth."

I mean, I get it. And I can’t say that I disagree. But this is the way it is at literally almost every college and also at many jobs in a major metro area.

Correct me if I’m wrong but aren’t there some companies in Nova/DC that make you pay for parking? Pretty sure this girl I used to talk to worked in Crystal City and had to pay for parking.. not the first time I’ve heard of it either. Don’t downvote me I agree with OP! Lol

so real for that

I mean, accurate.

Can parking be free though? A lot of people go to GMU and there isn't exactly a lot of land to go around in the DC area.

I mean my mom works at a major hospital and she still has to pay like $10 a day to park in their garage

I agree west campus is far and not easily accessible, but parking is pretty cheap over there.

Good. Give em hell

The other big joke is the gates they installed in Rapp deck. Just an excuse to charge us more and they don’t even go down. What’s the point if they don’t even use them?

I used to work at another university and now go to grad school (where I work as a TA) at a different university and both schools made me pay for parking🤷🏻‍♂️ I honestly thought it was normal.

i mean no tuition money goes to parking, and they have their own loans to pay. Blame the bureaucracy of the college itself, not a department that’s left entirely on their own when the school has millions in the bank.

Bet it felt good to write that out

I'm going to get mass downvoted for this, but parking costs money to maintain and America has coddled drivers to make them think they are entitled to a parking spot for owning a car. Think about all that land dedicated to parking and what else they could be doing with it, that's why you pay. Also, none of your tuition money goes to parking services.

Lot k is free on weekends? What other lots are free on weekends?

Maybe this is a controversial opinion, but parking isn't free to maintain, there isn't enough of it to meet demand, and Fairfax and the university are both well-connected to transit. Parking should absolutely be paid, and the proceeds should go towards bolstering the shuttle services as they currently do.

They're not wrong, especially considering the massive amount of vague fees that add up to your general tuition, like what the fuck are those for? I just went to check for context, somebody for god sakes tell me how am I paying $1300 for fees...

Based, bring this to osu

So glad to see things haven’t changed since I graduated in 2013.

Commuter campus = big money from parking

I pay $70 a month for parking at work (or $8 a day without a pass). Any free college parking is built into tuition - the meter maids don’t pay themselves.

Holy mother of based

He’s mad 🤣 and need a hug

Damn, mine's only like $75 for the year and you can park anywhere there's student parking 😅

Which lot is free parking on the weekends?

Mason is a largely a commuter school and they definitely know how to make money from a captive market.

Why should we who don’t drive subsidize those who do? There is a not unlimited number of parking spots and we need some method of allocating them. Making them free will encourage many more people to drive.

Every single university I’ve worked for has charged parking on their main campus. The state college is allowed to PROFIT from this department. The bookstore too.

…And the governor says folks have to work on campus instead of remotely for this reason.

it’s obviously a private parking lot. I can’t fault the owner for making money. What needs to happen is the upper staff need to make an agreement with the owner of the lot.

Literally every university ever

The greedy are never satisfied

I used to work at GMU at a facility that had free parking. We needed our lot resurfaced and instead of having GMU do it, we all did it so we wouldn't put ourselves on the radar of parking. It's absolutely asinine they charge that much to park. If it was in a major city location, I could maybe see it to prevent randos but for a campus where the only possible reason a vehicle would be parked there is some sort of university business is ridiculous. Even if they want to require parking passes, just charge the 2 bucks it takes to print the pass and call it a day. Absolutely ridiculous

I work at a university outside the city. Our staff doesn’t pay for parking but I know there are some universities in the city that do pay.

They Are Planning A Revolt

They're gonna speed past you only stop suddenly in front of you, causing you to have to go around them and be mildly annoyed.

They’re gonna roll, rather slowly, right over you! 😂😂😂

All hail our robot overlords

Okay, but seriously... wtf? Did that many people really place delivery orders at the same time?

One time I almost tripped over one on my scooter. And I was going as slow as they were!

Skynet has activated. Run for your lives! The robots are coming for us!

Skynet says what?

Aww poor little guys. I hope they do.

The little guy brigade

![gif](giphy|10bCgkbPzuKQog) There is definitely a dolphins-taking-over-Springfield vibe here.

That is a nice picture tho.

This future sucks.

Can they conspire to get me a well-paying job?

I love them!

I'm at the career fair today and saw them. They look confused af. Love those little robots.

Those little guys work very hard to keep the student body moderately well fed.

The age of men is over! The time of the food bot has come!

I for one welcome our new robotic wheeled overlords!

Oh my god as a joke i keep taking pictures of them whenever they cluster like this. Send em to ppl n call them The Herd 😭

….Run https://youtu.be/mw2kKyJu9gY?t=125

I watched a student absolutely kick the bolts out of one just because it was driving at him. I was like “okay then someone’s cranky”

Dude, I'm not kidding.. I was driving, and three of them just stood there on the crosswalk, and I was just stuck there in my car, hoping they'd move away 😭

![gif](giphy|loXYEBCOIsZ41ctErc)

Now if i had a picture of GMU students sitting on each one, my life would be complete.

I agree to dumb...

Dude, I'm not kidding.. I was driving, and three of them just stood there on the crosswalk, and I was just stuck there in my car, hoping they'd move away 😭

I used to work for them. They’re probably going back to the hub to get cleaned.

“No, they’re just too dumb to cross the road.” (From a non-Redditor GMU student)

Awww they get cleaned!? Is it like a little car wash for them

Pikachu is skynet confirmed

GMU SLANDER

The amount of accuracy and effort in this video, is astronomical

If you can't find a way to get extra credit for this, your professors should all be fired.

Slander is correct and accurate. Perfectly fit our complaints and stress into one video. Finals getting to us.

I love this lol

Repost because of audio issues lol

Not the bears. hahahaahaha

The rap deck driving most accurate part of this video

This was too accurate and funny

Bro humbled everyone

u/savevideo ayyy chem made an appearance 😎😭😎

Just found out the highest salary at GMU is the basketball coach. $925k a year…such an accurate video

Bruh the Southside and Rapahannock one are so accurate I mean, it’s all accurate but those specifically I can relate to

Incredibly accurate

NGL, this was hilarious

This is hilarious but accurate

lmaooo this is amazing

I KNEW THERE WOULD BE A CS ONE LOL

incredible work

This video is golden

as a commuter, gmu was resourceful af but man is it BORING

This is art. Well done.

Who else can’t stop rewatching this

The Southside one got me

Hahah this shit is hilarious.

Is the CS joke just that we smell like shit cause ur honestly not wrong

I wish all the gmu professors see this

Gave me a much needed laugh in this grim finals season

Wow so true

I am the 3 hour commuter

Fucking Brilliant 10/10 great fodder to watch during final presentations

I miss GMU.

Bro or sis hit the nail on the head with the Chemistry Professor thing.

I can't help but feel like the Rappahannock parking deck one is targeted toward me...

This is the last thing that’s keeping me sane during finals week. I needed this, thanks.

The OAI is so accurate especially for CS classes lmao

Best one yet hands down

What about professors giving extra credit if they do student evaluations?

Tbh, would still sit through 66 in prime traffic with broken AC in 90 degree weather over living with anyone in the dorms.

Can someone explain the freshmen and bears lol

I dont get the bear one

GMU was such a waste of time and energy. I’m glad people are waking up to it

I-66 😂 are you from Cali?

Beautiful. You've been through the trenches, and emerged to grace us with a taste of heaven.

u/savevideo

As an employee, the I-66 part got me. Shit is a nightmare.

This campus can’t be real man 😭 In front of the JC 5 minutes ago D1 yapper

Oh Jorge’s back. He was there all the time when I first went to Mason in 2017.

Honestly that's a funny change from the "abortion is murder" types. That said, thinking about a pastor learning what gooning is and going out to protest it is crazy work

This man called me a whore for wearing a skirt with boots. I mean, I had a great time but come on Jorge….

lmao, this stuff happens almost everyday on campus it feels like

If everybody would collectively ignore them, the crazies would go bother other people.

Maybe he’s offering to lend a hand? 🤢

Who is pastor George, who is gooning him, and what is gooning? Thanks! GMU Alumni

Who summoned the goon police😭😭😭

And the backpack to top it off lol …

eh better than the homophobes

JMU has a Jorge too. These weirdos just love to harass students 🙄

Can we talk about the burger backpack and the spiderman morph suit? Bro is living his best life and doesn't give a shit about anyone's opinion. That's what college is truly about.

So im confused is he telling people to stop gooning or is he telling pastor Jorge to stop gooning?

Was that what that was? I just saw it lmao

Anyone remember the guy who dressed like he was from the 1920s that latter turned out to be a convicted rapist? Brother Ross was his name or something?

Mr. Penis Police

Oh im going to troll him lmao

You heard em guys, let it rip! ![gif](giphy|VeYzYs6eD7K8jhyChc|downsized)

Imao I was just there literally a minute ago

Is that Pastor Jorge or it’s addressed to Pastor Jorge?

"Hello fellow kids, did you know that Christ is busing frfrfrfr. But gooning is Ohio so get on God." is how I imagined he talks.

These people have been coming to campus since before I was a freshmen in ‘06. Yes, I know I’m old.

Big respect Jorge

I CAN'T GOON 🗣️🗣️🔥🔥 I CAN'T GOON 🗣️🗣️🔥🔥

Damn he’s still stomping around campus? This dude has been there since before I started and was still there when I walked. Crazy tb

*Ahem* MY BODY MY CHOICE!

I passed him on the way to class. I felt like I was walking in the streets of a medieval village lol

Reads like PastorJorge has a gooning problem

He’s the Iglesias Pentacostal Church Vans you see around Fairfax and Springfield

Bruh why did all the funny shit start after I graduated

I knew someone was gonna post this 😭

How dare you question God’s righteous truth! We must know who Jesus will damn and we must ho no mo! >:(

This guy was there back in 2015

I was literally there and I saw this man holding that sign

He’s a regular

tell me you're not from nova from without telling me

How is this guy even allowed on campus? People need to stop trying to dictate what everyone else does and just get a grip on their own urges and secret obsessions—it's straight-up demonic. I'm truly exhausted by it all. Nobody was out there telling his age group to stop gooning back in the day; his whole generation did whatever they wanted. I'm tired of my grandparents and great-grandparents who just won't kick the bucket already. I didn't grow up watching MAS*H—I only caught The Brady Bunch because I was lucky enough to have cable. Nobody has the right to destroy someone else's chance at expressing themselves, just because the lights are dimming in your own pathetic life. That doesn't give you permission to start snuffing out the light of the world, you losers.

I’m not sure why this sub was in my feed but I’m here solely for Cheeseburger Backpack ![gif](giphy|Tv7nRPkmpwMc8)

“Stop gooning Pastor Jorge!” sounds like the name of a parody anime.

Yet someone’s walking around with a hamburger backpack and that’s totally normal to you?

RIGHT????? What is bro on about??

Oh my god this guy is still going strong nesrly 10 years later?

A normal day on campus

wait he’s goated

Lend a hand to those in need

Burger backpack

I graduated in 2013 and there were always crazies yelling in that exact spot almost daily.

Pastor Jorge and Sister Cindy ("Ho No Mo") -- a slut shamer, have free reign to minister on college campuses paid for with Virginia tax dollars... GMU is a state school, not a private one. Why are these people allowed on campus? They are not employed by the school, or the state of Virginia and they are not students! They are trespassing...

With the lock down causing a drop in pollution, the world is beginning to heal. Dolphins have returned to Mason Pond 💚

That dolphin got me feelin some type of way 😩

Truly a thing of beauty 😢 Even Cabrera couldn’t chase them off forever

Can we start a petition to reverse this?

WE are the problem

Awesome meme :)

Wow the natural predator to the geese is back.

There are probably a thousand geese on campus rn

They're so beautiful! It's a shame we polluted the pond so badly that they left :(

this is so incredible 💙💚

Mark my words: they'll sing "so long, and thanks for all the fish" and be gone before students get back in the fall.

I bet the geese are not happy about this. Last time I saw them they were picking a fight with that crane.

That sky looks photoshopped. Should be more gloom.

Thank GOD! maybe they'll finally beat the geese up and get them to leave.

I'm calling BS. Mason Pond is clearly manmade. Y'all are fucking dumb.

Well, THAT didn't age well...

How do they go away? Can dolphins survive on land?

You do the math

Republicans have invaded our haven. I repeat; evacuate, evacuate.

16 people didn’t pick up on your joke Lol

underrated comment haha

Protest on Campus Getting Interesting First protest in a while I feel is the least controversial/serious

"I wouldn't buy a Twinkie without a wrapper. Would you?!"

This really doesn't get talked about, I'm actually kinda glad they did that

Whoa, dude, I stumbled upon this anti-circumcision protest too, and let me tell you, it was wild! People were all, like, passionate and stuff, holding up signs and chanting slogans. I never really thought much about circumcision before, but seeing all this energy and enthusiasm got me thinking. It's pretty cool that folks care so much about what they believe in. I'm no expert, but it's exciting to see how people come together to voice their opinions and make a change. It's like a whole new world of awareness, man!

Unfathomably based

I never got a choice, my foreskin was taken without my knowledge and against my will when I was a baby. It’s about time someone gave a voice to this. 😂

As someone whose foreskin was removed for medical reasons, I think that should be the only reason for the procedure

Anytime I see this sort of thing, regardless of what they're standing for, my first thought is "don't you have somewhere to be?" At least they aren't shouting like that group from last year was

Ppl will support this and then be pro-life 💀

He was on tosh.o go on YouTube and type tosh.o circumcision

Lol this world is getting ridiculous by the month. There always some new crap people wanna voice out then complain later when they did it to begin with. It is what is it is, plus guy not getting circumcision can easily get infection in their foreskin, it also can lead to foul smell if they don’t wash. Just saying.

Honestly, I’m good. I don’t really want mine back at this point.

The only time I’m not on campus

Bro put in zero effort on that blood. Looks like red sharpie, amatuer

Best thing after a tiring day

Anti circumcision= antisemitism.

They do know circumcision is medically required in some cases 🤦🏾‍♂️ and as a guy that’s circumcised I don’t see in any way it being child abuse . Unless you mean how Jewish priest or other third would places do when they painfully circumcise and suck the baby’s penis . Then yes that’s child abuse

Calamari is your solution. Run over to Giant for some raw calamari rings, and hand pieces to them.

Kings among men, I would say they're out here doing God's work but I guess that's actually what they're fighting against isn't it 💀

Honestly, I could get behind this protest.

![gif](giphy|l3E6uhDAN3W7vylji|downsized)

lol blood stain on his pants is a nice touch

Actually based as fuck. The fact that circumcision is not considered genital mutilation is wild let alone the fact that it is culturally acceptable and even encouraged.

latter device gifted consists great singles

Never seen an uncircumcised dildo

"Haha supot"

Foreskin hermit crab swap. We should trade foreskins.

Circumcision doesn't affect your errection size rather it prevent bacteria from being grown within foreskin (dick cheese). Furthermore, keeps it clean and less smelly.

Nice chatgpt

I will say I’m not big on the movement but after seeing one preformed after birth in nursing school I am all for it

This group of protestors are part of a group called the bloodstained men, they protest against genital mutilation across the country in public areas like our campus and at hospitals, public squares, etc. They are much better than the anti-abortion and religious extremists who shout and try to engage passers by. These dudes didn't harangue or annoy students. So I say more power to them. More protestors regardless of belief should follow their lead.

Do you think that anytime you see anyone doing anything? Or is this just you not approving of anyone advocating for something.

So when you see a group of Palestinians protesting about their family members being killed you just...dismiss them as shouting vagrants with nothing better to do? Nobody should ever do anything, I suppose.

You really question that people may value things they stand for more than what they may be normally doing?

Not necessarily

Saying something like this just shows a fundamental misunderstanding of what people who are pro life think. I’m pro choice, but it’s important to understand the other side so we can work most productively, even if it’s just how to best counter them. Pro lifers have their stance because they believe that a fetus is just as much of a life as a baby, usually because of religious soul stuff. Therefore, obviously killing babies would be bad. You likely agree with them on the fact killing babies is bad, you just disagree about where to draw the line at what a person is. I think you’re alluding towards “my body my choice” type ideas being ironic from someone who is pro life, but someone who is pro life doesn’t think you’re potentially killing somebody when doing a circumcision. That being said, your comment doesn’t make sense because these people are saying we SHOULDNT do something (advocating for a negative) which is the same as what pro lifers are doing.

Then simply wash yourself. It's not hard.

Also destroys sensitivity.

Not a fan of bodily autonomy?

When it’s not medically required, on a child…it’s child abuse. Same as cutting any other healthy body part.

No. Baptism replaced circumcision 2000 years ago.

Then ya not looking hard enough

I have a marble for trade.

Anytime there's a campus disturbance caused by people doing something unnecessary

Way to shoe horn a virtue signal into a circumcision post my guy

GMU Snowball Fight (2025)

We got Mason students interacting with each other before gta 6

gmu social interaction??

Love this, makes me miss home

The snow ball fights are so fun, I wasn’t in this particular one, but I was in a few snow ball fights close to Southside and The Ridge.

When I was on campus RAs and staff would be such hardasses about people not being allowed to throw a single snowball

That’s great!

We had a snowball fight in the commons outside Dickenson hall, too. It was a lot of fun!

I love this!!! Why didn't this happen while I was there 😭😭😭

Stop I have videos of this right outside my window People had snowboards and sleds

Glad I didn’t go. I have a cold already!

Wet floor sign? Good luck in jail😂😂😂😂

Is that Presidents Park? We had an amazing snow in 2002 when I was a Freshman, one dude took the hood off of his car and used it as a sled.

In winter too?

To the guy who almost got hit by a Toyota today around 4:40 I caught it on my dash cam :/ Heading to class and an idiot almost hits a pedestrian.

Looks like most Mason drivers

What a fuck.

Don’t even get me started on how awful most people drive in the parking garages…

Failure to yield to pedestrians in a crosswalk. That's a citation w/ points.

I swear that looks like the same car that almost ran me over. They stopped at the stop sign near Lot A and I was crossing then all of a sudden they drive directly at me then stop right in front of me and there’s two girls just laughing at me then they drive off. Idk how I was cool with it but it is what it is

Fuck that dude

You might be better tactfully rolling over his windshield gently and have him pay your tuition.

Casually flexing your Tesla

Infuriating! If the car made contact then I would call it a hit and run.

Running after the car is insane bc what we’re you about to do😭😭

Looks like me on my way to my 8am years ago

Just curious how u got ur dash cam cuz I want one after some idiot almost hit me

Lmao was he thinking he would run after the driver?

his mirror would have been on the ground

The amount of children behind large vehicles makes GMU one of the very few places that I'm happier for it being more policed.

Ik you're supposed to yield to pedestrians but the way some people play with their own lives assuming other people will always do what they're supposed to is crazy. Like don't run out into a crosswalk unless the car is absolutely coming to a stop or you will be clear before it gets to the crosswalk going at the speed it is currently going. People really be stupid driving and walking

Did you take this footage to the police?

I hope he bites into his burrito and realize the beef is still frozen (directed to the reckless driver)

I wish you could read the license plate and report it. Especially if they’re repeating offenders as I’m reading.

Sidenote, I wish I could find a dashcam with multiple cameras and decent quality. I was about to ask what make and model camera you got until your video got to the side shot which made me realize you're in a Tesla. Makes me think of getting a Tesla next going I'm in the market for a car among some other reasons

Bitch should’ve looked both ways

Uhh run faster???

It’s bc the driver is a capricorn

Of course it's a Toyota

You know you can export those videos so you're not posting a video of a video, right?

What a hell.

right!? almost been hit multiple times by people speeding around corners

One time there was was a camry parked dead center of the garage with the left door open so I squeezed by the right side only for a girl that was getting her stuff out of another parked car jumping out and nearly getting hit by me.

probably try to get the plate number? looks like this guy got it though!

Would have scared the driver a lil lol

It’s a Tesla so it’s built in. Order a dash cam off Amazon it’s about $60 so worth it especially driving on campus

Probably wanted to get the plate number.

The license plate should be visible at the end of the video. I would take it to GMU police

I know some other car manufacturers have it as an option from the factory but it’s so well integrated in teslas. There’s a big tax incentive if you do end up looking for a tesla. I would say if you have access to charging at home or at work go for it. Definitely research :)

The plate should be visible in the end of the video (not for us, but for OP)

Doesn’t matter at all, Just move on with your day.

What are you going to do with the plate number? Hello police, this car almost hit me can you track them down so they can deny it happened then leave because there is nothing you can do?

To do what? You have no idea who is driving

Yeah, I think it's getting more common in cars made the last few years. I got a 2014 plug-in hybrid Ford Fusion and a 2016 GMC Canyon for when I need to do a little hauling for doing work. But when my car kicks the bucket or gets a little long in the tooth I'll be looking at Teslas among some other cars. Just hard to find a decent dashcam that works. Unless you pay an arm and a leg. Just seems with how cheap a lot of tech products have gotten over the last handful of years a few hundred or more seems a little steep for something that's just strictly a dashcam imo. Can't bring myself to pay that much

True but exported video would be higher quality so the license plate would more likely be able to be read

Be careful about who you make friends with bro 💀 Throwaway acc for a reason. I made a friend on the first day of class, and things went well at first. By the second week, they kept asking me for help with hw assignments and for recordings of the lectures when they weren't there. I didn’t help with the hw I just guided them. I only sent one lecture recording, and when it became a pattern, I eventually stopped. On Monday of this week, they texted me at 8 AM to come to my dorm and use my printer. Yes, I have my own printer. I didn't see the text right away as I was sleeping at that time and bro there's printers on campus to use. Now they're asking me for gas money (they commute) because I should pay them back since I didn't text them on time. I finally ghosted them and sat somewhere else in class. Moral of the story: don't allow yourself to be used by people.

They ain’t your friends. Just acquaintances.

That's not a friend bro, that's a whole ass leech

Asking for gas money makes no sense lmao. I've also had people try to use me before, especially when I started college. You ultimately recognize these common patterns and just don't engage with them at all. They aren't your real friends. Also, these people are more likely to ghost you right after the semester is over.

Friends talk about things other than school fyi

some people have some nerve. I don’t even like asking someone for a piece of gum 💀

Gmu right there

Wait until the alumni foundation starts money grubbing

Users are great aren't they?

what the hell is wrong with people 😭 that's so weird...

Damn you manage to make a friend when people on here can't even get a friend.

Lmao what in the world 🤣🤣

😭😭😭😭BRO WAS NOT UR FRIEND

sounds like a scam message you get from reddit accounts asking for money

What a weirdo. Sounds like a manipulative person. I had bad experiences with trying to make friends at GMU.

are people GENUINE acting like this in public??? do they have no shame???

Ah hell nah 😭😭. Commute money is insane bc u didn’t answer their text

Same thing happened to me. I made friends with this group of girls and they were constantly asking me to buy them food saying that they come from low income families and they don’t have enough. I would always cave in. Eventually they started taking things from my dorm without my permission- snacks, drinks, clothes, books. They also asked me to borrow my notes and books from classes I’d already taken. Came to find out they were trying to sell the same books on the college Facebook page the next semester. I still didn’t learn my lesson. When I moved off campus, 2 of the girls came over. She was also friends with my roommate. It was super late, I was asleep. My parents had just bought me groceries, the girls emptied my fridge and took everything home. Not to mention my parents had helped them out before, giving them rides multiple times. When I confronted the girls, they got mad at me. I cut them off and then they tried to turn others against me bc I wouldn’t let them take advantage of me anymore. Don’t over extend yourself, maintain boundaries and look out for selfish people!

The amount of social climbers at Mason is absurd. Seems nice at first, but then they start wanting homework answers and help on exams. I try to guide them to the right answer without giving it away so they actually learn. During an accounting exam not too long ago, I had a guy next to me try to get answers off me during an exam. Touched his shoe with my shoe to get my attention, then typed on his laptop screen: “can I see that for 5 minutes?”. Guy was really on the edge with the professor and TA proctoring the exam. I just ignored him and immediately turned my stuff in and left.

that is why I don’t want any new friends

Different situation but similar. When I was at VCU in math class, I was talking to another guy and found out we lived within a few blocks of each other. So, we started walking to and from class together. Within 1-2 days, I realised all this dude wanted to talk about was Rush. That's all the conversations were about, lol. How much he loved them. How they were the greatest band ever, etc. I ended up having to walk a different way home after that because while I like Rush, I don't care about them enough to talk about more than Tom Sawyer. Oh, also, this was 2012. Decades after they were a huge deal, lol. Beware indeed!

they tryna take the easy way out Lol

avg gmu experience

This happened to me my first year at NOVA! I could NOT get rid of this girl either I ended up blocking her on social media. Now I’m actively avoiding making any friends at GMU. I do not want college friends.

Sounds like you got simped.

Peers. At most. My “friend” accidentally charged 400 dollars a month on door dash. She’s never been reliable and reminds me of your peer, are they also a proto-alcoholic?

Bruh this is insane lmao

No way u let them get that far 🤣

Why do you have a printer lol

Exactly, and they will likely ghost after the sem is over.

Just ~~acquaintences~~ leeches

GMU definitely has its share of weirdos and oddballs. Asking for gas money? Sounds like that guy has the 'tism

LMAO truth! I get bombarded with letters 😅

Average friend at gmu

It's from a surfing related bumper sticker I once saw.

Graffiti at exploratory this morning

There’s some graffiti on the building in front of Aquia that says “Let them eat cake”

Sic Semper Tyrannis I will kneel to no king

We need more of this

missed opportunity to quote RATM. "the land of the free? whoever told you that is your enemy." - Know Your Enemy RATM 10/10 recommend this bop

That pic is 4 yrs old 🤷

Imagine risking your college career and a possible felony for some social justice warrior clout on Reddit lol

I think I saw one on planetary side too last night when I was leaving the hub. Did not stop to see what it said though.

Sic Semper Tyrannis

I checked to see if it was still there, and it looks like they buffed the text, now there are grey splatters covering it.

Free enough for graffiti.

Someone get this door some Freedom!

I get the message, but how about we not vandalize this illustrious state of the art university!!!

The fact that you could do this disproves your point.

That's pretty punk. As long as it's promoting activism and sticks to tagging government property and not private property, it will have decent effect.

God what a compete loser to do this to our campus.

Living next to trash ? I won’t feel free either 😂

i feeeeeel kindaaaa freeeeee

I love that

We need a half naked woman standing over that corpse. The Virginia flag goes so hard.

I love activist graffiti

no it’s not i’m literally the one who did it lmao

It’s alright. I’m sure his parents will be very happy to know that their son wasted thousands of dollars because he wanted to pander to progressives

Students on this campus had their homes raided by the FBI over spray paint, what the hell are you on about.

Wow such a rebel doing it where the powers that be will never see it.

Why do you say that?

enjoy dealing with private businesses when you get screwed over by one. Only to get the run around by someone in a Filipino call center because the business will make it as difficult as possible for you to get a positive resolution. Government is necessary, deal with it.

Cool let’s do it to your property next. Where’s your car at?

Unless that is your building u r defacing then u should be arrested for vandalism I saw the same thing in cali 4 yrs ago PS If u vandalized i hope this post is used as evidence of a crime.

I'll correct it for you: I'm sure his parents are proud their son used his educational experience to use his voice to save democracy. There you go, fixed. You're welcome.

And who was president when that happened?

You're seeing it, though. Every little thing counts.

Your asking me why I called someone who graffitied our school and forced a poor janitor to clean it in the cold is a complete disgrace to our school and an outright asshole?

nah where is YOUR car at?

Gregory Washington has been president for several years now. I don’t really get what you’re saying with this.

I'll take "how does that fucking matter" for 300 Alex

The government is I'm going to impress people regardless of who is in charge, the only difference is who they oppress and how open they will be about it. Democrats don't make a big deal of it when the FBI arrests activists for no reason. You want to learn more about how much the government hates activists, go look up cointelpro.

I see shit like this every day. Nothing ever happens

Yeah that's fair. I don't think they're a disgrace to the school, I think it's just kind of a dick move when you put it that way. They might leave it up though, there was a chalk thing on the front of planetary reminding people to vote at Merten Hall from the 2020 election that didn't get cleaned off until 2023.

I think they meant president of the United States. I think it doesn't really make a difference because the government is going to oppress people regardless of which party currently holds power, but for a lot of people it is still important.

Not with that attitude. You gotta recognize the change that has happened and how people in our government are actively back peddling rights. You just gotta keep paying attention, at least when it isn't too mentally taxing. Change happens when we band together and stand up for what we believe in. It's easy to fall down the nihilistic thought abyss. It's harder to stand up and do the work. Everything worth doing is hard. People are doing the work. You just have to look. Yeah, protests on campus get annoying. You wanna focus on school, go for it. But don't dismiss people who are gonna be actively fighting for their lives with what this administration is doing. There is enough history in the past 100 years showing how people fought for their rights to vote, to marry, to simply exist. Do not obey in advance. Use your rights. Don't take them for granted.

In case if someone was missing the campus fall colors 🍁🍂🍁

omg no major construction

Excellent pictures. Was this taken with a phone or a professional camera?

beautiful pics! aw man, i’m really missing being on campus 😩

Holy shit campus looks gorgeous

Touring campus during fall is probably what sold me on GMU. Sucks it’s so dead with COVID.

Thank you! Really miss being in campus and the pictures are great!

wow! these are really pretty! thank you 🥺

Only picture where GMU actually looks nice 😂...nice job!

Beautiful! I do miss seeing stuff on campus. There are so many beautiful trees

Looks so good ❤️ i miss campus so much

I didn’t know I was until I saw this lol. I just realized with classes going online for next semester, at some point I walked around campus for the last time and didn’t know it....

damn i miss it..... Jk lol

This is too nice to be our campus... GMU has never looked this good in my three years here

Thanks for sharing! Miss it

Thank you Pandey!

I was ); I hate online schooling

Damn. Campus actually looks pretty decent for once

You can see the through the end of the first pic, that’s the whole new glass building constructed beside the Fenwick!

It was phone [iPhone 11] and I used portrait mode for the second. You can follow me on [IG @clicks_by_pandey](https://www.instagram.com/clicks_by_pandey/) for more such photos :)

Phone. You can see some faux bokeh on the second picture around the leaves.

the struggle

As a friend of a grad student TA'ing for an undergraduate class, I can confirm the accuracy of this meme

when that happens it reminds me that they’re humans too. Guarantee my man does not want to be up at 2 with outlook open but he got back to me within half an hour

i emailed mine 14 FUCKING HOURS AGO AND THERE HAS BEEN NO RESPONSE. Maybe hes been on reddit all this time.. Dr King, look at MY FUCKING EMAIL.

As a GTA, half the time I hold off on replying until the morning just so my students don’t know the truth

Lmao, I love this comment.

That makes sense. My professor made me wait 2 weeks, then the TA sent out an announcement to send all questions about grades or assignments to them.

ayo what does GTA stand for? my CS class has GTAs i think but idk what that means lmao

I said HALF the time! :p I only hold off on the stuff that isn't urgent (which thankfully so far no nuclear bombs have gone off). Obviously if it needs to be addressed and I see the message before I pass out, I help em out.

GTA = graduate teaching assistant. Grad students teaching to help pay the bills/tuition, but still (usually) under the guidance of a faculty member.

Can we agree that this option is a lie?

I've been selecting it for 3 years. Hasn't done shit

thought it was just me.

It's really dumb... all the buttons do the same thing.

I select the second one and I still get the prompt every time, no real difference. I don’t get the point of it.

Why does it not work?

The whole MFA is cooked and even this

![gif](giphy|12NlCFUvTokWXe)

GMU websites feel like they were designed by a first year student

Idk why they keep it this way lol prolly an error they're too lazy to fix or sthg

The biggest lie ever told

All of the options do exactly the same thing, the box reappears next log in anyway 😭. I find that it happens most often when you are logging in on different devices though.

Also how Duo will make you enter the code 10 times in the same device after clicking “this is my device”

I AM SO SICK OF THAT

At this point I just click accept everytime without looking tbh

Always has been

Get lied to, kid (satire)

Always has been.

It works for me as long you don’t login from new computer or browser that message does not show up

first day of the second week 😍😍😍

😂😂😂. This is little too loud for comfort

Just about done with not being able to log into class due to random tech issues because each professor uses a different sytem everyday 🙃

Went from worried about classes during summer break to EXTREMELY worried about classes during the second week. This is not going to go well for me...

Kiiiiillll meeeeeeee

Those IB classes I took are paying back but, Honestly if it weren’t for IB classes I would be in the dumpster now, it did really payoff 😅

You really didn't have to call me out like that 🥴

THAT'S MY PRESIDENT!!

Never knew attending GMU would be such an act of revolution but I’m proudly here for it!

Forgive me President Washington, I wasn't quite familiar with your game 🙏🐐

Dunk on that pedophile

Depicting Spider-Man as Trump is an insult to Spider-Man fans everywhere, just sayin.

what did washington do?

A link to an article, with a workaround for the pay wall https://archive.ph/hH1Rf

Downvoted for calling out obvious bs.

but didn’t the supreme court deem it unconstitutional? i think dei should be replaced by need based admissions. disadvantaged white people need help just like any other disadvantaged person.

Thanks for the tip! I'll definitely try that too. My go to is putting a "archive.ph/" in front of the URL of the article I want to read. And archiving it to read it if somebody else hasn't already.

Discussion and memes are fine but please do not engage in cringy reddit political beef here.

Absolutely nothing about DEI initiatives deny assistance to disadvantaged people for being white.

Most disadvantaged whites live in red states. You should make your case to them, but I’m not hopeful you’ll get anywhere with them since disadvantaged whites are not in favor in anything that helps them AND black and brown people. For example, see SNAP, increased minimum wage, single payer health care, universal basic income, increase maternal and paternal leave, unionization, etc. the staunchest opponents of all of these programs are low income and working class whites.

You guys know we get a NY Times subscription for free through the Mason library...https://infoguides.gmu.edu/news

Not when I'm no longer a student. It's been years since I went to gmu. Current students I'm sure still have access to things sure

ops sorry didn't know but yes current students and i think faculty/staff

My prof is savage lmao

A 70% is a C? WHAT???? If only more professors were that generous

My favorite is when I had an 89.8% and I asked if there was anything I could do (like write a small paper) to make it an A (.2%) and my professor said it would be “too generous” to give me that much of a bump 🫠 she didn’t do + or - either.

As an ex-prof, I tried this once. I think professors forget that yall are people first, students second. Shit happens. Being this black and white doesn't work anywhere. Hell, I have yet to meet a single organization where I've been employed that deadlines aren't blown without major catastrophe (i.e., DOD, Army, DOI, non-profit, Big4, and even GMU). Sorry this prof forgot what it was like being a student.

Good for the prof! Too many people want to put in extra effort only after they see their grades.

Based professor

Aw man it must suck grading all those McGraw hill online web assignments :(

Not savage. Just straightforward. I have no idea why students expect professors to play so many games

Sound like Andy yao talking 😂

Person Sounds like a dick

We need a bot for this!

Those professors who refuses to give extra credits less than 2 is a bitch

Mason professors suck 💩

Professors are dicks. Story as old as time

I think the profs use some faq template cuz i have another prof who has the same questions but diff answers

what I’d do: Go back and look at the syllabus to see whether it describes how the professor grades. If it doesn’t, and grading was never discussed in class, then I’d consider going back to the prof and present findings. If the syllabus DOES state the prof’s grading policy (and it almost certainly does), and/or the prof presented grading during class, then, well, if it’s that important to get the better grade, I’d consider tell the prof that I’ll be back next semester to try for that better grade, and thank the prof for their time responding. And that time, work hard and get the A+. The Plus comes because you read the syllabus, paying attention in class, asking questions, helping others, maybe forming a study group, and of course showing up to class on time, prepared, turn your work in early or on time, and you study and do well on exams. It’s really very simple.

Live by the assessment system, die by the assessment system.

I like that we don't deal with + and - here, too much splicing hairs, and it seems like we get fewer whiners. Under the + and - system, everyone is a couple points from the next grade up. &#x200B; Usually, I have hard enough tests that at the end of the term I curve \~86% and up to A, 74% and up to B, 62% and up to Cs. And usually I have about 1/3-1/3-1/3 breakdown (plus a few inevitable Fs).

Work harder. It’s not your professors fault you didn’t get a A. Quit with the sense of entitlement. There are multiple people that didn’t get in to the school you are going to that would die for that opportunity. Just remember when you are working hard. There are multiple people working harder to take what you dream of.

Just remember C’s get degrees

Only issue is a 77.9 is also a C. The only nice case where a 70 is a C is if you're not doing really good

My college doesn't do C-, it goes from B- to C+ to C to D+

The School of Business doesn’t do C- so it depends on the class.

Offering to write a small paper means that the instructor will have to come up with a prompt and grade your small paper

Like if it’s a fraction of a point I wouldn’t say it’s asking for too much to have it bumped up, but the example this professor used is definitely a big ask.

If they think that's a big bump, I wonder what they think a small bump is

so you would give bonus points at the end of the semester to whoever complains the loudest?

People feel entitled, nothing new. They think because school can be difficult that someone will help them just because they want to be helped.

This is like 90% of profs’ policies on any campus lol

Some do, some don't. Tons of entitled students though.

but 20% is due to exhaustion from grade grubbing

Bffr, if you didn’t get the grade you wanted too bad, you should’ve worked harder. It’s unrealistic to expect professors to round up grades by more than a fraction of a point

yes, all of your instructors are exhausted by grade grubbing

Looks like a regular ass scale to me, except C- is nicely rounded up to a C. Idk if that’s repeated for A and B but if so, that’s actually kinda awesome! One of my professors just doesn’t use +- like the rest of the school, but he did the math and found that it raises the average grade. While that sucks if you have an 89 or 79 or something, it helps on average. So eh, I’ll take it. Edit: also I don’t go here, no idea why tf this popped up in my Reddit feed lmao. I think I’m a little too active in my schools sub and now it’s just recommending me any random college

At my college a 70 is a C minus which is lower in our GPA than a C. (2.0 is a C and 1.7 is a C-). At my high school a 70 was a D. So it depends

Mine does 93-above = 4.0 87-92 = 3.5 83-86 = 3.0 77-82 = 2.5 70-76 = 2.0 69-below = 0 And I really don't like it. I prefer the classic scale. My comm college did it "the normal way" and I much preferred it

Is that just for engineering or for other classes?

“Convince me to give you .2 %”

Not necessarily, but I think students do have valid arguments for messing up or missing assignments. They have valid arguments for, say, extra credit. For example: not everyone learns at the same pace. Let's say everything finally clicked for you, but it happened later than most of the other students. Once it clicked, you had nothing but As, but you failed the first test. You're willing to put in extra work to make up for that. Why would I punish you when you're obviously trying?

That’s not at all what they said. If your mother gets hit by a bus the day of an exam, that’s a factor to a reasonable professor.

You are beginning to understand how real life works

You go to a dick school

Just because it’s the norm doesn’t mean it’s not a dick move

I've gotten recommended like NC State and Cal State Fullerton's subs before 😂

Yeah, I mean for me I'll take a C+ instead of a C if that directly equates to the GMU GPA scale unless it goes off of Percentage to GPA

A number of schools don't do C- grades even if they use +/- elsewhere, to make the C/D boundary clear.

but doesn't the challenge come in applying that fairly to all the students? what about the other student who does great at the start of the semester and then has a hard time at the end? if you give extra credit to everyone, isn't that just another assignment? or do we give extra credit on top of the other extra credit?

Dating advice - update Well everyone I asked her today after class. I really did want to chicken out as class was ending but I made myself do it. I asked her how she she did on the last test to break the ice, then asked if she’d be down to get coffee next week. She said she has a boyfriend, but she wasn’t rude at all about it. I’m pretty bummed bc I still think she’s one of the most beautiful girls I’ve ever seen, but I think I’m happy I still tried. Thanks for all the advice. Even though it stings I think I’ll be happier in the future I tried.

Good man for shooting ur shot. That’s all u can do 🫡

Getting through this anxiety hurdle will help make the next ask a little less nerve wracking. Good on you man!

Hey, you shoot your shot, you move on.

Proud of you! Here's to the next girl being single!

king shit right here 👑

Good on you for saying something. I know waiting can be tempting but at least now you know and aren’t bottling that up for too long. There will be other people, don’t worry.

The closure from asking always helps!

You asked, respected her boundaries, and while she didn’t say yes, she was nice about it. As well, you now have some closure and can move forward to find someone who is available. Good job. 👍🏼 You’d be surprised how many people can’t do that.

Good job for asking and good job for taking it well! I’m sure you’ll find someone :)

Mad respect for you dude! You did what you could :)

Everyone goes through 1 of 2 pains. The pain of discipline or the pain of regret. Trust me bro, the regret hurts a lot more

Trust me man I get you this happens to me every time on campus.

good for you man 👍

You miss 100% of the shots you don’t take. You’ll get it eventually. Use this as a lesson tho. Girls are regular people just be normal and keep it cool.

Respect bro for shooting your shot now you move forward brothera

You will get the next one king! At least you shot your shot.

So what now? Friends or?

I am so confused by your post history...from a few months it states you're married?

You miss every shot that you don't take 😃 Just like Forrest Gump said, Life is a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get. Don't worry brother.

Respect bro

Hey good thing you shot your shot. This will give you confidence

Told you she’s married

I don’t go to GMU, this showed up in my recommended. But good on you, this takes a lot of courage.

Asking her out has been the best accomplishment so take it and roll with it man! You overcame your anxiety and even though you were rejected you also felt that it’s okay if these things happen. Next time you want to ask someone out you might not be as anxious and that’s all that matters 👏👏👏 Great work!

Hit her with the "its okay, I'm married' https://imgur.com/gallery/NEtCbqH

Tren harder at the gym

Was she the professor? If so, boss move

Go to the gym and people will notice

Told you get talking to her in academic contexts first. But hey! Next time next one… the right one. 💛

You tried and she was kind. That is a win!! Sorry it didn't work out tho'

I actually would be down. I’m pretty unproportional rn, 305 bench, 315 squat, 405 dead

See old post, I explained for someone else who asked

Maybe he's divorced. Marriages come and go like the wind for servicemembers.

Or just talk to other people?

I see. Well, I'm glad you shot your shot. You'll find someone.

Never say Never! Because who knows? Her boyfriend's situation may or may not work out! If it doesn't, she's going to remember him, if she's interested! I'm not saying to wait around! What I am saying is to leave the door cracked just a bit, because you never know!

Usually it’s students that plagiarize the lessons and put it on quizlet but this is still funny lol

Easily searchable/textbook verbatim questions are a concern for sure. Of course, when a professor has less-searchable or original questions, you start getting complaints about how difficult the exam is or how the questions were somehow not the exact same as the homework questions from the textbook. They really can't win on that one.

If You’re gonna use textbook questions verbatim, I’m gonna use the easily-searchable answers to them. Put effort in get effort out.

I had a really, *really* difficult professor for ASTR 101. She just talked as slowly as possible and rarely said anything new. All her homework assignments were pretty much just me opening Quizlet and teaching my self... I hate online classes...

Lol I got called out for not citing the Gettysburg address

I had a highschool teacher that used to put basically her entire test on quizlet then question why nobody was reading the book.

Last semester my chem professor legit didn't even have us to the camera in the lockdown browser. This semester they are getting their panties all up in a wad like our struggle during a global pandemic is hurting their feelings.

For real tho

Yeah, one quizlet I found literally had the professor's name on it

I had a classmate a couple years ago and she seemed pretty smart, now when I look up quizlet questions for classes in my major I usually land on a user account that's literally her first and last name. Thanks Nina, your notes saved me a ton of work later in life.

Jesus was her name Rosenburg?

This is how my async STAT 344 is right now. The weekly videos are of him slowly and barely understandably mumbling exactly what the lecture notes say. I think a textbook would do a better job teaching this course. Also, in the lecture notes, the only important bits are the first paragraph of each section and the formula list at the end of the section. Everything in between is just a derivation of the formulas where he turns a complicated looking formula into a less complicated one but never says why the original formula was true in the first place.

Abe Lincoln: "Four score and seven years ago, our Founding Fathers set forth..." Random Citizen: Um source please? Mhmm, I thought so. Checkmate libtard.

Nahhhhh, Witchalkovsky or something like that. I literally watched her lectures on 2x speed just to understand her

*shrug Leave a review at the end of the class about it. Make ur voice heard yknow? I will be

No literally I physically laughed out loud reading her comment. She said she “wouldn’t send it to the honor council but should have” what do you even mean

You must be fun at parties

nvm there’s no way you’re invited to parties

Happy Monday Everyone

This is such an interesting semester.

First off, singular AFAIK. Second, aren't the law and economic schools pretty seperate from GMU proper?

*He was just trying to date someone*

Whoa dude Lol I’m surprised that’s still up. I’m assuming it was already there right or did you OP place it there?

He just wanted to pick some pictures out of his Instagram.. /s

aaaaand it’s gone.

hold up, what is the backstory to this??

Hey Kavanaugh was investigated and found clear of any wrong doing fair and square! Even if the investigators were forbidden from: talking to witnesses, collecting evidence, subpoenaing anyone, or asking anyone besides Kavanaugh himself if he did anything wrong! ^.../s

Don't give him even a moment's respite: let Kavanaugh know every moment of the day exactly what you think of him. Let him know that the world isn't solely made up of rich white assholes who will protect him.

Kavanaught was checked and cleared he never raped anyone. They did this to Clarance Thomas too. It’s a political tactic people.

I thought he was teaching in London tho

Just proves the left cannot meme again. Facts>no facts &#x200B;

Way to spread fake news

This is just a distraction from the real (Fairfax) campus issues

facts are facts america

QnJldHQgS2F2YW5hdWdoIGRpZCBub3RoaW5nIHdyb25nLg== Man I love the number 64.

The writers this season have really outdone themselves.

Scalia Law School is a separate entity yeah, economics is a department in CHSS, not separate at all

What's with the economic school?

*wanna see my art?*

It was there when I came in at 7:15

Still there when I was walking to my 9 am

I did not 😂 honestly when I saw it I thought it was something legitimate for the university

It was gone when I walked by at noon today. There were tours of the campus going on today so I’m sure it was removed as soon as they were aware of it.

GMU hired Brett Kavanaugh for the law school

Is this actually true?

Replace “white” with “black” and then read it back... remember what Martin Luther King Jr. said, "I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character."

Clarence Thomas did, in fact, sexually harass Anita Hill. Just because Congress chose to disbelieve her doesn't change that. He's a pretty bad judge, too.

The left? You realize that Liberals are not the left right? Edit. Why are y’all booing? I’m right. The left is characterized by anti capitalist views, liberals love their boot licking too much to be leftists.

Lol, right wing nibbas use the same tired memes over and over again as well. None of you can meme.

It's not like there was little to no evidence and the accuser only came out to the media when he was being nominated as a Supreme Court judge or anything.

Found this post through another sub, here to tell you that I’m not sleeping on your Monique Heart. Brown cow stunning.

I can't wait to see the season finale in May.

I vaguely remember something about the Koch brothers and the economics... grad school? Something.

I hope I see it when I come in today at 2pm :D

Still there!!!

Yeah a two week seminar in London for the summer and ne gorsuch for the same but in Padua Italy.

He was “investigated” under extremely shady premises with crazy boundaries (only like 2 witnesses questioned) for ~7 days. Regardless of whether or not he committed sexual assault, it’s my opinion that someone who would publicly act the way he did during his hearings should not be a judge at any level. But I’m nobody.

Yes, the FBI held two separate investigations involving the matter and found no evidence to conclude that Kavanough was guilty. In one they found that one of the accusers friends fabricated the entire thing. Do I think he’s a scum bag? Yeah Do I agree with his politics? NAH Is it fair to ignore evidence and react based on how we feel, or what we think of a person? Nah I think it’ll bring more money and reputation(good and bad) to Mason and thus is an overall good thing. Just my 2 cents

I doubt it but I can't confirm or deny. I still hate the fact they hired someone accused of rape. Plus he's a scumbag anyways &#x200B; Edit: AND why the fuck does GMU want his name related to the school? I feel so bad for any victims of assault, this is supposed to be an inclusive school so fuck Mason for thinking this was the slightest bit ok

FYI, the user “smitty...” lied to you to try to make you share similar political views as them. The true number of witnesses was 9, and a quick google search will reveal that.

They don't like to hear anything that goes against the rhetoric spewed by their Fox and MSM gods. Best not to try to argue with them. It will never be worth ur time, especially on the Reddits. They still probably think Russia & Venezuela are communist anyway. (Hey there fellow lefty! ✊ Wonder if I know you lol)

I WAS HOPING SOMEONE WOULD NOTICE 😭😭 i love you so much

The Koch brothers and their foundation largely fund the economics program and appoint professors that push their views, mostly right wing economic theory. This applies to both undergrad and grad school.

All witnesses involved denied that it ever happened, please stop spreading propaganda

I also found no evidence that Kavanaugh was guilty, and didn’t do much less than the FBI investigators in the Ford matter did.

Just because someone is "accused" of something means nothing. "innocent until proven guilty" is the way our criminal justice system works. The victim in question was given every opportunity to tell her story and give witnesses that could corroborate it, her own best friend that she said was at the party with her had no recollection of Kavanaugh being there or anything like that happening. Anyone can go around and "accuse" someone of something, doesn't mean you did it.

Tiny parade! So I’m just sitting here, not expecting anything - and suddenly, this mama goose strolls by with a line of tiny goslings. Whole squad was adorable.

got the whole crew

Why are they so cute?!😭🥹

i saw them munching on some grass yesterday!! happy little family 🥹

Goose is aura farming 🤣

NAH IM JEALOUS

That is so cute

I love the way they rock their body forward while walking.

I did as well! They are adorable, they really make the campus so much more lively!

BELIEVE. BIG. 🔰 #HERstory made today in Henrico, VA! Our women not only won their first ever conference title, they’re going to the NCAA tournament for the first time ever as well.

espn using the old (better) logo 🤩

AMAZING!!!!!!! Wonder the last time a school had both their men's and women's programs win a conference championship.

School pride is back baby 😎

bought the t-shirt within 2 minutes of the game ending 😭 glad at least one cool thing happened while i was here

Love to see it.

It’s happened four times for mid-major schools like us: (Vermont, Princeton, Iona and Drake) https://www.midmajormadness.com/2023/3/12/23636470/put-two-rings-on-it-four-conferences-saw-the-same-school-win-both-mens-and-womens-tournament-titles

A very kind soul slipped this under the door for me as I was sobbing in a bathroom stall in Exploratory my sophomore year of college. As I apply to graduate this week, it just means that much more to me.

What a kind soul. I wish nothing but good on them and that theyre protected.

I’m not crying, you’re crying

That is so kind ~ congratz on making it to graduation :))

He always send his angels to help ! Congratulations 🎉

It’s this kind of act that reminds me to always put goodness into the world.. and thank you!!

This hit harder than it should have

You guys get email reminders???

Sounds like ENGL302 lol

I took two non-degree courses with Mason over the past two summers, and I gotta say, you guys must be as sharp as owls with some of this stuff. Like buried under tabs and links and pages in redirects in Blackboard were the assignments, readings, powerpoints---you guys are tough. I could've easily missed huge assignments if it wasn't for the other students getting together in a Discord right away and pinging me.

Wait why is this my engl 101 class

I felt this 😂

U can't have a gf and be on reddit.

Why the fk does novacc charge 150 for parking violations?!?!??!?!

With or without the accompanying ticket, this is the best fucking fortune I've ever seen. ACTUAL wisdom.

Pretty sure nobody wants the fining system to work

Wait so non-Mason students can get away with getting parking tickets at Mason?

Same thing if you get a **parking, red light, or speed camera ticket** in DC or MD. You are not required to pay, but don’t park on the streets there or else they could tow your car. r/washingtondc said this.

They also won’t let you register classes happened to me once my entire registration was on hold

God bless you sir 🫱🏻‍🫲🏼 Doing the lords work

I think NOT

Yep and so can current Mason students who drive a car registered to someone else lol

I need more context i worked in DC for few months and got three speeding ticket in the same place and time each time. So what happen if i don't pay

Damn... I've gotten 3 speed camera tickets in Maryland and paid them all off; the car isn't registered to me either

**parking, red light, or speed camera ticket**

For next time! Even if the car is registered to you, they can’t do anything. They’ll send you letters, but just ignore it.

I mean the consequences

They’ll probably boot your car or tow it if you park on the street.

George Mason University president rejects Education Department's apology demand

I've always found Washington pretty milquetoast, I'm extremely glad to see this. Makes me proud to be a Patriot.

Never been more proud to be a Mason Patriot.

The school's basketball team getting scammed out of over 200k did way more damage to the school's reputation than any sort of junk like this could ever hope to do

Well things are going to get real ugly. Half of me is glad the university has realized if you give a fascist an inch they'll take a sudetenland, the other half thats a grad student is panicking about how many more relataliations Republicans will impose on me and my work. Its been miserable already and its been less than a year

Good. Don't let fascists walk all over you.

Mason has earned an alumni donation out of me. Glad they're fighting these fascist scum bags.

Good! Time to push back! (and keep pushing back).

I agree--apologizing means that you admit that you did something wrong, and there's no wrong to admit. Seems like the same logic as for a presidential pardon: by accepting the pardon, you are confessing to the wrong.

Keep pushing back against the Dump regime!

Stand your ground.

GMU in 1967 and on Google Maps. I added the red highlights to help see what has and hasn't changed.

This is awesome. I love seeing comparisons like this.

Having taken a class in Krug, I'd be surprised if it's not one of the original buildings.

I had an old alumni take me around campus before and it took me 2 weeks to unlearn what he told about where classes and stuff would be and how to get to places because it had changed so much

Damn this is cool. Legitimately one of the best posts on this sub

Forgive me if this is a dumb question, what's the building off in the far right of the frame

Thank you for this

I wonder how much of the expansion was done during the 00s. I feel like there has been construction there for decades now, similar to UMCP. The growth in DC metropolitan area is just huge.

At least they left alot of woods west towards Roberts Rd. and the trees that have been planted with on going construction are healthy. It's a much greener campus than most think.

Haha, that's the same thing my parents say. They also attended in the 80s.

Same with my mom.

[It is](http://ahistoryofmason.gmu.edu/exhibits/show/schoolhouse/contents/newhome). West, East, Krug, and Finley are the original 4 Fairfax Campus buildings (Krug and Finley may have originally been named "South" and "North"). Classes were first held in an [old school near Bailey's Crossroads](http://ahistoryofmason.gmu.edu/exhibits/show/schoolhouse/contents/schoolhouse), but this was temporary while Fairfax campus was planned and built.

I believe that's the Inova Emergency room and Sunrise at George Mason (Senior Living facility). Not sure why it's highlighted.

Most of it actually, at least the planning or pipeline ideology. The 2006 NCAA Final Four run sparked a need for more residential buildings and to increase academic buildings to handle the growing academic offerings and increase in student population. http://ahistoryofmason.gmu.edu

It's true that the emergency room isn't part of GMU, but I highlighted it because you can still see the building in both the photo and on Google Maps. If you look closely you can see that they've added an expansion to the lower-left since the photo was taken.

I thought it was the Fairfax City Hall for a second, guess it is not that close

Oh cool gotcha. I think ballen15 and I misinterpreted your intent on showing just GMU changes. It's cool to see how the surrounding area has been built up though. Thanks for clarifying!

Goodbye GMU subreddit 🫡 It was a long fuckin’ semester for me, but I finally graduated 🥳🍾 What’s next? I’m gonna work on myself, chase my goals, and hopefully find a stable job. Congrats to the class of 2025, and for those who haven’t graduated yet, your time will come. I’ve been through absolute shit like a breakup and thought I wouldn’t make it, but I did.

I saw a bear on my run this morning. It's so cute

I wonder what he’s majoring in.

I would've turned back so fast

Oh my god I can’t believe I got up earlier to run and missed the bear this is so disappointing

now that bear owes $7000 to the university

Holy moly those leaves are beautiful

🎶~Tell everybody I’m on my way~🎶

Oh yeah I think he’s in my Typography class.

im so glad i’m off campus rn

nature is healing, the bears are coming back to gmu

As a community we have to name this friend since they appear to be here to stay.

Here's an idea what if we make our mascot a bear instead of just a horrifying large-faced man

I bet it's living in those woods west of campus is been spotted in a couple of neighborhoods as well. I hope everyone leaves it alone and that it doesn't get hit by a car or anything.

You can pet them. I'm not kidding.

Omg his mother would be around

I fucking hate bears

I think he's working with the honey bee initiative.

Must've been pretty ✨unbearable ✨

This made me exhale through my mouth instead of my nose, thanks.

Hes prolly thinking who to eat for dinner tonight

It's just a friendly black bear, as long as you don't make them feel threatened they won't do anything.

I thought of brother bear when I saw him

Say it with me - “ko-DUH”

Jessica’s typography class?👀

jessica’s typography class? 👀

this is my first time hearing of this! and i doubt the school would be found liable for any attacks— black bears are very skiddish in general and the only attacks you really involving them mainly have to deal with someone getting too close to a cub. it’s not like they’re purposely keeping it on campus, nor are they actively maintaining a habitat suitable for it (where do they even sleep around here??)

I don't know I feel like if someone got hurt by the bear they probably threatened it

That's an adult

He's just a black bear?

Between 1900 and 2009 there have only been 63 people killed by black bears in the US and Canada. https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/how-to-avoid-being-eaten-by-a-black-bear-179225111/ None of which were in Virginia.

I get scared seeing a puppy. A bear would would give me a heart attack

I wonder how he'd react to the delivery bots.

Nah I’m in my boy Rick Heffner’s class.

Understandable

He could probably smell the food within and try attacking it

is he good? i really like jessica but i’m curious about the other profs who teach it.

I am now concerned for the safety of the little marshmallows

He’s REALLY amazing. I had him for a graphic design class my first semester and he’s just a wonderful teacher. He’s extremely helpful, funny, and a great teacher. He remembers the smallest of things in his students (we have a running chicken joke between us) and is just a super cool guy!

great! thank you for the insight, i’ll keep an eye out for him when i enroll for more graphic design classes down the line. :)

Campus looks beautiful tonight

sometimes i miss it but then remember i didnt have to pay for a parking permit

Man I miss taking late night walks through campus hopefully everything will be back in the spring

Damn shame I won’t be there till January at least.

Not as beautiful as you OP

I wish I could see it lmao

Campus always looks gorgeous at sunrise and sunset. That's always the best time to go take a walk through campus.

cant wait to jump in the lake

I've been away too long. GMU done took off their glasses and let their hair down. Damn.

I miss it so much. Most nights I’d go to Mason Pond until I felt like leaving.

most factual statement of the day

Hate it or love it, facts

Noooooooo but our basketball team got top 4 .... over a decade ago!!!!!!!!! Still riding that high 😎

Eh I don’t hate it or love it. It’s alright. Most of the complaints I see are universal complaints that can be used against any university, and most of the people who hate the social life at Mason don’t seem to make any attempts at actually trying to socialize. Cause they spend all their time on Reddit or locked in their dorm room.

Gmu is literally only as good as your involvement in clubs and academics. Gmu Has an Econ program that is recognized world wide (for example), a bunch of political events/talks, and some really good clubs with a lot of cool people but you’re not gonna have any fucking idea about any of that if you go to class and then stay in the library all day until 8 PM and then commute back home (what I did my first two years 😩)

Love it or hate it

I have lots of grievances about Mason that were not the same at other universities. For example, they changed the Information Technology degree twice while I was in that major, adding new requirements effective immediately regardless of catalog year. This added an extra year almost to my school career. They also increased tuition more than other schools. They sold names of buildings to businesses, like really? Eagle Bank Arena? Verizon Center? They regularly closed off huge sections of the parking lot for a circus that had nothing to do with the student body, but instead made parking unbearable. Everything they did was money motivated and I almost never saw a decision that put the students first. Other schools actually care about their student body.

Schools: FOOOOTBAAAAL Mason: whut. We kinda have rugby. Schools: YE, Lambda Kappa Theta Chi whut bro Mason: Delta Kappa, only on a weekend before break.

Bro that was 2004... almost 2 decades ago! This what be must Redskins fans feel like riding that superbowl high from 1992.

This. Literally all the complaints I’ve seen at Mason are pretty much universal for other campuses. Dining bad. Parking bad. Tuition expensive. None of that is unique to Mason. The only real gripe I think I’ve seen is about Koch and Kavanaugh, both completely fair imo. Otherwise the problems are pretty much universal or self created (i.e.: join a club if you can’t make friends easy). Also complaining about your university is barely a hot take, everyone I know who went to college is either super preppy and bleeds X college’s school colors, or loves to complain about how shit it was.

Why not..? The building names rights are an easy funding source that they wouldn’t get otherwise, and doesn’t cost us anything

Wasn’t it 2006?

My experience is a decade old now, but I joined the men's crew club (now coed) with 0 rowing experience the first week of my freshman year and it became the framework of my social life at Mason. By the end of sophomore year my roommates were rowers, I was eating almost all my meals with rowers, and I was going to crew parties. We were pretty chill, and luckily had a house (might still) literally 2 blocks north of campus on University Dr. I lived there my senior year. Joining that club got me into and kept me in the best shape of my life, gave me a pretty wide circle of not just friends but academic resources through people, allowed me to travel to places I otherwise wouldn't have gone to, and ended up being the defining part of my college experience. We definitely didn't bleed green and gold, we were just a bunch of dudes and a few girls who liked torturing ourselves. I honestly don't know what I would've done without it. Joined a frat and been fat, drunk, and stupid I guess. That particular club took a lot of time and dedication, and I voluntarily gave most of my free time to it. But it could be any club. At the time there were like 20 club sports you could choose at Mason, and you could have that experience with any of them. But it does take that initial effort to put yourself out there.

Devils' experiencer here: These things weren't as present at my previous universities. Dining.. tolerable, more so Parking.. 200/year, not 700/400 but also not a km off campus center Board is 1/2 than what we pay even on private schools. In the end Mason is not for the 'college experience', but it is for researchers who want to grow in their field and if you want anything more you're wasting \[your\] time and money. As for pride, mason lacks it hard. Hard criticism: there is no unity in our diversity. However we have a lot of potential and the work you put into it will return fold.

I think selling parts of the school for corporate advertising is distasteful, particularly considering how much we spent on tuition. I find it hard to believe they are that hard on money. What’s next? McDonald’s University? Billboards all around campus? I’m just not a fan of forced advertising. I think it makes the school look tacky.

That’s a bit extreme lol, universities have had corporate sponsors for decades and as far as I can see there’s nothing even remotely resembling the scenario that you described at any of them. Anyways, nearly every major university’s stadium has corporate sponsors and it’s a plus if anything that part of the team funding is coming from outside rather than 100% from our tuition dollars. As for being hard on money, nearly every public institution is, except for an elite handful, so it’s literally free money for us that the company provides for exposure of their name. As long as the company itself isn’t distasteful, I don’t see any issue.

Not wanting to have advertising forced down my throat at a school is extreme? Wow the capitalism is ingrained deep in you. We will have to agree to disagree.

*the picture you described as being the next step is extreme; the “McDonald’s University” and the “billboards all over campus”. Don’t twist my words also unrelated, but since you brought it up, if you hate capitalism so much why not go elsewhere? And again don’t twist this to what some far-righters say every time someone wants to discuss social injustices or protest during the anthem, they’re basically saying if you find any faults in the country that you wanna improve you should leave. So before you try to frame what I’m saying as that, that’s not what I’m saying. Now, the U.S. was fundamentally founded on capitalism so if that something that you don’t agree with that’s your choice, but in this case it is fair to say why not go elsewhere then?

I would love to move to a more socialist country, but it’s not that easy to just move. And yes, you are saying the same as the far righters. So someone living in a country can’t find any faults with it apparently. And this isn’t unrelated to capitalism, the culture of capitalism is prioritizing money above all else. Apparently I need to worship it and never critique it in order to live here.

One question, what exactly is the university prioritizing money over when they get corporate sponsorships on a couple buildings? Is there something we’re losing? As for the last statement, not at all, I know very much that there’s problems with capitalism, but the thing is there’s no “perfect” system and the pros to cons ratio of this one is better than the others. There’s a reason why we have more technological, scientific, medical, you name it, advances than any other free country in the world, and all of these come from the private sector (capitalism!). There’s a reason why Amazon, Microsoft, Netflix, Apple, Google, Twitter, hell even the very platform we’re having this discussion on right now, and pretty much any other major revolutionary company, all originated in the U.S. There’s a reason why our top universities are more prestigious than those of other Western countries even though their top institutions have been around a lot longer. There’s a reason we consistently make the most cutting-edge scientific discoveries and accomplishments. There’s a reason why people from every other country come here for world-renown-expert medical treatment for rare diseases or when their doctors don’t have any answers. And finally, there is a reason why people from all over the world want to immigrate to “America”. I’m neither white, even remotely wealthy, nor a natural-born American; I immigrated here with my family, leaving our relatively well-off life and coming here where we were essentially poor for the first decade plus, so to be clear this is not some patriotism-blinded view of the U.S. So that said, we have our fair share of problems like any other country, and constructively critiquing specifics of where you think capitalism or any aspects of the U.S. fall short, in order to improve it (as every engaged citizen should do), is one thing, but completely trashing it as a concept altogether (what you basically did about capitalism, and what many do regarding the U.S. as a whole) is another.

Coming back in the fall like ....

Rush the fence! It can’t stop us all!

“What do you mean traffic would be worse if we took out the main road for 4 years?”

God damn straight facts

Would be no problem if they allowed electric skateboards...

The asbestos in the rubble of the old buildings will, though.

I saw signs over saying walk zone and that it is not allowed to ride a bicycle scooter or skateboard but I saw an old guy with a mason uniform riding his bicycle not caring about the signs.

The issue is that they're banned in residence halls, probably because everyone is afraid of big batteries after the whole hoverboard fiasco

Sorry didn’t know they were banned in the residence halls. They should put bike lanes everywhere as it is faster riding a vehicle than walking.

I got accepted!

Congrats! That scholarship will be a huge help, if you’re in state that’ll cover almost a semester and a half every year! If you keep a part time job to pay for the rest you can probably graduate with no debt which is a fantastic opportunity!

Damn nice, that’s a big ass scholarship.

Congratulations! Can you share your stats and major?

![gif](giphy|yJFeycRK2DB4c)

Congrats dude! Your hard work has paid off!

Congratulations! All of your hard work has (literally) paid off! Well deserved!

Congrats bro welcome

Oh, you’re out of state. Congrats!

Congrats dude

You just got the BAG. Congrats though. That money gonna save ya life and then some

Congratulations and wish you the best of luck! 🤘🏻

Congratulations 🎈🍾🎉

the scholarship holy shit congrats!!!!

Congrats on both the scholarship and the acceptance! Welcome to the patriots!

Congratulations

Congrats! Enjoy your time!

Nice! Just a question, what GPA do you have to maintain with this scholarship?

Congrats!!!

Nice! You’ll enjoy it here; we’re no party school, but home basketball is consistently a good time. In addition, if you’re coming here to the Fairfax campus, Fairfax City not half a mile north is an excellent place for food and errands.

Congrats!! That scholarship gonna come in clutch!

Congratulations 🎊

You made 80k while in high school. 🙂

Nice. Congrats

Does it mean 1st round for everyone on Dylan?

Woo! Congratulations and all the best in your academic endeavors!

Was this through Sophia learning

How did you receive your acceptance letter?

I'm out of state so it'll be more expensive but $20,000 off a $36,000 sticker price is more than I could have imagined!

Lol that was my first reaction too, thanks!

First year out-of state, majoring in communications. What stats did you want?

Yeah still, that entirely covers things each year like housing and meal plans, which is a huge help! If I could suggest, think about becoming an RA either your second semester (apparently that’s possible I didn’t know until I applied), or your sophomore year. That will give you a single room for free, or a free room even if you still choose to live with roommates. That will help stretch out the scholarship even more!

Which state are you coming from?

Probably asking for SAT and GPA.

Rethink communications bro, unless you plan on being a lawyer

Haha bad joke I guess. Where I’m from, anyone getting free money is supposed to treat everyone a drink or a meal.

North Carolina

Average JC hallway flier

It'd at least be entertaining which is more useful than other shit they've spent our money on.

Finally a cause I can get behind!

Oh hell yeah they got flyers now

I am all for it

Pls I’m manifesting this

Is it a chakra ball or a spirit bomb

Would be even funnier if it had the approval stamp like they walked into the student centers office and said “hey take a quick look at this”

Gunna have to ponder this one

Will there be baby oil

You’re so real for this

Thus is golden 😂😂👏🏽

Bro, I really felt this

I never related to a meme this much before

*exam submitted* BB: 8 new assignments available 🙃

it has 69 likes i'm hesitant to like it

Literally all of my data analysis assignments

Nice ^I'm ^a ^bot. ^Join ^my ^community ^at ^r/nicebot2.

This was on the wall at mason lol (credit Michelle C)

I feel like ive been everywhere on campus, but never have I seen purple wall before! Where is that?

Thanks. I don't have any parents. ,🥳😭🤯

I'm on the Arlington campus. I just saw a group of students, and while they were outside, they were neither wearing masks nor social distancing (close enough to hug each other). Wear a mask.

Jokes on you. Economy is not good and jobs that pay a living wage with benefits are hard to come by. Probably smarter to move back with parents/relatives after you graduate. [https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/03/realestate/coronavirus-moving-home.html?searchResultPosition=1](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/03/realestate/coronavirus-moving-home.html?searchResultPosition=1) Also, it's perfectly reasonable in a lot of countries. I know its normal in Spain.

Can't think of any place on Mason like this - but if this isn't Mason, we need it here!

And you didn’t say anything? Gonna need your Karen card back

They were outside, I was inside working haha Another person inside pointed it out to me originally

Hate being a business major!!! Look what they’re making us do for our finals 😞

BRO HOW?!?! I’ve been stuck on this part for 8 HOURS NOW

I hated this assignment, I asked for an extension

My prof made us write an analysis on a Cocomelon documentary 😔 it was so hard

BRO Rainbow Dash’s eyes 😭😭 Now you’re definitely not gonna pass 😔

Where are your citations bro

Didn't even do the background

You colored the wrong part of Spike’s right eye green

Bro forgot there was a back 🙏

It’s called MARKET SEGMENTATION! Duh!

Engineering? Ever heard of business???

You paid for this….

Collab with an art major on this!! Easy cheat just make sure they use Crayola

Dang I’m so sorry bro I hope you pull through, thoughts and prayers 🙏

points off for coloring outside the lines….. AND it’s incomplete…. i expected better from you

Focus on yourself, not people you’re never gonna see in a couple years.

I’ll m sorry have you taken BULE 303

Crazy to think people get federal funding for this

Jealous af what the hell

On a serious note, business majors at GMU are BS type and more quant focused with real stuff like stats, calculus, etc. as compared to BBA from lots of other universities.

Shut up atleast you’re in college🤦🏻‍♀️but yea as a bussiness major from 24jumpstreet university 🤣Yea throw most that shit out the window 🪟Real life will kick you in the ass with this attitude and yea I would A+++ the fuck out of this. Your professor is actually very smart. The details are what matter. Your creativity is key in any bussiness scenario or you aint gonna make it G. If you haven’t turned this in i would redo it and get back to your childhood brain 🧠 get inspiration from there. Your to lost in the mf numbers, stats this and that. If you want your bussiness to excel branding is key and how you work things DIFFERENTLY from your competitors . You’ll get lost in the abys of everyone else running the same thing you do. Stand out and throw the whole rainbow in this piece make it the next Picasso. You’ll remember this assignment out of the rest. Wish you luck ✨

I take that over some of the finals Ive had

Bro is cooked lol

GMU Slander Credit u/StressedOutDilf

Should I make part 2 ? 👀

Omfg the bookstore 💀💀

Do a slander for all the more common majors.

Bro or sis was on point with that Chemistry one. You had me rolling.

Who brought this back 😂😂

It's too bad the computer science department has such a bad reputation for personal hygiene.

oh man fuck i66 not even a interstate more like a racetrack

Chem professors got me xD

This was actually pretty accurate

The bear was personal hahaha I almost had fight off two deers

The Rapp deck one is on point. I don’t know how many times I’ve almost been hit because people don’t stop or even slow down when leaving/entering the lanes (if that’s what you call them). Like at least slow down, look, and then turn unless it’s like 7 a.m. and empty

Don’t forget the rapes and sexual assaults that Taylor ryan and all his praternall brothers got away with in 2007 2006 2008 check out Corbinfisher.com he was sending dudes from GMU down to fl and having them do gay porn after a little coercion and GHB of course , I think we call that trafficking

I’m so dead lmao.

This guy who is reposting, is a troll account who is karma farming. He the same mf who posted about “lost nose ring on campus”

u/savevideo

You're an idiot if you told that girl you made this video she would of gone on a date with you LOL missed chance

Updated version, I feel like there’s so many new things to make fun of

Remember to slander the game design majors. We deserve it.

Most definitely

I have ideas to give you for the next slander, these are just suggestions, and I am writing on the top of my head. I know some of these are inevitable for any university, but they still make a good slander. The price for operating public scooters is kinda high, also, the public electric scooters have an electric fence that turns off the motor when you are in the center of campus. The ambulance and other emergency services gets called every night for something happening on campus. Freshmen had to take a quiz called “Perspective” and it was a sour attempt at talking about politics, bias, and frankly wasted everyone’s time. I see the delivery bots get themselves stuck in sticky situations where only human intervention can set them free. The protesters at Southside or the Johnson Center, they just show up and bother everyone. The campus trashcans aren’t emptied enough, so swarms of bees start circling near the trashcans. There are people who walk up to you and recruit you for something. At nighttime, some of the people in the dorm can get loud. The process of even applying for this university was extremely laborious and so much paperwork was involved.

It’s some troll who is reposting it. I’ve already seen this lol and so did many others. Bro just wanted free upvotes from someone else’s work

Park at your own risk for sure😂

Man if people think it's funny and everybody up votes it idk what I'm supposed to do. As long as it's not continuous shitposting I dont want to make a big stink....

I appreciate it. I was looking through the top posts and genuinely thought this was hilarious. I realized many people, especially freshman, wouldn’t go back in time and see it so I gave the initial poster credit in the caption.

It’s a duplicate post, I literally saw this months ago and it has 600 upvotes

I get it, but people like the post. Please stop spamming the report button.

I’m not the only person reporting lol

This one goes out to you bois, stay safe.

I'm sorry guys.... this entire pandemic started because I didn't rub Mason's toe my first semester of freshman year 😔

I’m dead💚💚 😂😂🤣

Look at how much his shoes been polished by only a mason tour guides and parents

Not my niggah George!!

ur supposed to rub mason's toes for good luck. this is canon gmu lore

I ain't superstitious (just a little stitious), but when those finals hit every sem I be going there every day before class to rub that statue 😂

Despite the downvotes this made me laugh

The sacred texts indeed lol

I’ve never heard of that lol. Guess I haven’t been on Reddit long :/

Nice office reference 😉

There's also the second half of the tradition, which is common at other colleges as well, that if you step on the school seal (which is right in front of the statue) you'll have bad luck and will fail your classes. So if you step on the seal, counter it by rubbing the shoe.

Stepping on the plaque is supposed to cause you to take longer to graduate rather than give bad luck in any specific classes. I guess it could lead to the same outcome, but one could theoretically overcome your story with summer classes lol.

A fox in the snow to start off the semester

we can’t kill this one guys

I'm naming this fox "snowball" lol. Let's collectively watch out for this fox. And no hitting them with your car this time!

Word is on the street that it is starving.

Proof that even foxes need a snow day sometimes

In the wintertime I'll occasionally throw my food scraps out by the back fence for our local critters and always leave fresh water too. The rest of the year it goes into a compost pit, but in the winter its my way of also naturally eliminating food waste through our wildlife friends.. ..just small gifts of sustenance in times of scarcity...they are just trying to survive too...

Awww the little paw prints

This is so cute🤩

Looks like a cute like heartbreaker

Thanks for sharing!

Awwww so cute

Awwwww Where did you find it

This time of year is fox mating season (Dec-Jan). I live about 10 miles from campus and I've been hearing them calling at night for about the last week. If you hear something that sounds like a cross between a bark and a scream--that's them!

Thanks for sharing!

How did the last one die?

Fr you all better lock tf in this time 😤

We can fix that

You shouldn't feed wildlife https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/idkt_feedingwildlife.htm

This was at The Grove, but I also went around campus this morning and found fox prints in a lot of grassy/wooded areas

Got hit by a car near Rapphannock, rip Georgina

wish me luck, boys

You have my vote for president

Give us updates please!

thank you for your service

Give me updates. I bought an annual pass that expires right when Fall starts... Perfect timing...

Good luck hoping they’ll let us!

I'll be sending an email too. Hopefully if enough students voice this, something will happen.

Can I copy that word for word if you don’t mind? Let’s all spam that 🙃

Still need parking pass for those who go to the gym

They are planning to give partial refunds for housing and meal plans. Someone at housing told me. I would think though that they would also refund parking passes.

Not all heroes wear capes

Shit I'll send them an email too and I don't even go to Mason anymore, I just want to bother the devil-on-earth that is Mason parking

Just emailed parking services, here is what they said: https://imgur.com/gallery/11jbvSY

The hero we deserve and the one we need rn

Good luck! Let me know

They already offered prorated refunds before this, so it’s highly possible you will get one. I didn’t know about it until last semester but I can confirm that I gave back my parking pass and they gave me half the money back (it was an annual pass I used for one semester, so more than a fair amount).

https://www.reddit.com/r/gmu/comments/fjvxm5/since_were_online_for_the_rest_of_the_semester/fkpejjl/

Didnt even think about that!

Ah likely not unfortunately, im not sure about gmu but a lot of universities use parking charges to recuperate the costs of people destroying their dorm rooms, and its likely at this point that the damage is already done.

I didnt know it was wa extended until this post hory shet

Yeah I was wondering the same thing my parking pass I bought from Augusta 2019 - august 2020

u/masonparkingtranspo

You’re a hero. Please keep us updated!

The administration is making decisions about the possibility of refunds in various areas. Once a decision is made we will let people know.

Why would they do that if not doing that meant they got to keep the money?

i intend to! i'll post the response as soon as they get back to me

i dunno if word-for-word would be more effective that writing your own, but either way, i definitely think more people emailing them about this will make them more likely to bend. go for it!

I doubt the gyms will stay open for much longer so I'd still try to get the refund if it's available!

The gyms are now officially all closed until announced otherwise 😕

Probably us after spring break

Harvard not only just closed down, but actually ordered students who lived on campus to vacate and find other living arrangements (aka like go home).

like im not concerned about myself, but my mom has an immunoompromised system so i have to do whatever i can to not catch it and risk passing it on her.

They better make our classes online otherwise they ain't gonna get money next semester

like also my classes have been people reading off the powerpoint word for word i can do that shit at home yo

Mason will only change something if a student is directly injured or killed by it. Meaning a student has to actually catch Coronavirus and die from it before Mason does something. ˢᵒ ʷʰᵒ ᶦˢ ᵐᵃᵏᶦⁿᵍ ᵗʰᵉ ᵘˡᵗᶦᵐᵃᵗᵉ ˢᵃᶜʳᶦᶠᶦᶜᵉˀ

These closings were announced like 4 hours ago, settle down

I just want to graduate man

They should just put classes online so that will not delay finals. Idk how labs will work tho

\[Curb Your Enthusiasm theme plays\]

Wtf? What if your dorm is your only home

Same here :/

Once you been here for one semester, They own you!

>ˢᵒ ʷʰᵒ ᶦˢ ᵐᵃᵏᶦⁿᵍ ᵗʰᵉ ᵘˡᵗᶦᵐᵃᵗᵉ ˢᵃᶜʳᶦᶠᶦᶜᵉˀ My time has come

So your telling me there's hope

I mean, if folks are going to Harvard I am going to assume that 99.9% of those folks likely have somewhere else to go just based on the costs to attend to begin with. That said, I get your point and honestly, I don't know. perhaps the school has some sort of program to put students up in hotels temporarily, or perhaps you crash with friends or host families.

Not if I am dead. Big brain time

you should put something on there about how during the early 1900's influenza outbreak, the colleges that closed BEFORE someone got sick were the ones that had the least number of deaths. (It was on NPR)

Damn, you're that bored?

lol we get a whole week before they decide to do anything

That's huge brain! You know all the life hacks.

Right now I'm rewatching bleach so I'm not that bored but give me like 3 hours and I'll be bored enough

That's so true man, I hope they take the necessary precautions.

WAR IS OVER They're finally getting rid of it. https://preview.redd.it/le4jlvjp7bvf1.png?width=455&format=png&auto=webp&s=e4e149250410f33f979d49ea04c5bad93dab13b9

It was clever and a bit funny of them to call it shibboleth, but it wont be missed

Thank god that pop up was so annoying 😭😭😭

It literally never did anything, regardless of which option you picked. However, I am NOT liking the changes to Outlook where I have to re-sign-in every few hours, instead of every few days.

It’s the authentication thing where each time you log in, it asked if you don’t want it to pop up again. It always pops up even if you tell it not to.

"Shibboleth" is actually the name of the open-source single sign-on infrastructure they have been using for a long time. That system is used by many universities - but I don't know why this one always gave that bogus message, and it certainly won't be missed!

Ah okay!!! Thank you for that bit of info, cheers everyone :D

Get your RA if you see these guys in your building. They’re not Mason students and they’ve been breaking into dorms and harassing people.

Probably could've guessed they weren't Mason students by the fact that they can't seem to spell "elevator".

I thought they already got caught sunday why tf they back?

If they wanna do podcasts in elevators they can do that in the JC and ask people for permission. Or somewhere off campus. This is so awkward.

They wanna be copy trends and be tiktok famous so bad 💀 mfs think theyre quirky

More like call campus police for trespassing

This is so unsettling honestly. Like two random non-student dudes hanging out in campus elevators? You’re weird bro

What building were they in?

What is their podcast about?

I think the dude in orange goes to my school 😳

Isn’t the dude on the right the one who was able to get into TKE?

It’s the same high schooler who was able to get into a tke party

Can't police get involved or something? How are they even getting inside the dorms?

Lowkey look like they’re 16

Give it time one of them will somehow get a Spotify deal out of this

How did they get ON the elevator or in the buildings without a card to scan (Mason ID)?

These dudes were hilarious. I ain't snitching on them

GMU where the G stands for Gnowledge

We already did on them. They were given a notice and if they return they'll be arrested :) So yes just call mason police

They’ve gone to Eastern Shore and Hampton Roads

The ups and downs

Whatever hs they go to has failed them academically…

Same way anyone can.. Wait for someone to hold the door open.

Yes get police involved, we called police on them in Eastern Shore and they were told if they return they'll be arrested. We can get rid of them for good

Waited for someone to open the door for them?

Sounds like thats you in the pic 💀

Thank you. This was the right response!

asked and answered.

Ya'll need to stop being so Canadian

Most likely, it's super easy to just follow people into buildings.

I got midterms ofc I don’t feel free

We got GMU The Riddler before GtA 6

Why so serious headass 😂

He should make some more inspired slogans

Seeing a lot of boring ahh graffiti haters who dont get the point in chat. Idk why Im suprised tbh

I’m with it

Rumors were the person who tagged the door earlier was outed by someone else involved and GMU police were on the case, I'm curious if this happened at the same time as that or later in the day

They gotta learn blocking frfr, but nice use of a paint marker ngl

somebody tell that mf to get a damn job 💔

I’m loving the self expression on campus

Wait until you graduate and all you do is work, eat, and sleep only to realize you can't afford to exist or buy a home. Not a large home, just a small home. I graduated back in 2015 and still can't afford to buy a home. Last year I finally broke into the 6 figure salary range, and guess what. Things are still to expensive even when you have a good income.

based response with the yellow

How melodramatic. Feel free to move to the middle east

Report to GMU police.

I want someone to quote Hamilton. “I’m with you, but the situation is fraught. You’ve got to be carefully taught or else you’re gonna get SHOT.” Actually it’s long so maybe I’ll write it tiny somewhere only trained eyes will see

If you have to ask you clearly aren't affected

Like what (asking for a friend)

Bunch of snitches.

dawg we're in college

Yeah just making someone else’s life harder :(

What if someone self expresses on your house?

I’m sure the police will love it too

No thanks, don't want to get bombed by the US

I’d suggest you read some current news. Just above this post I had this … https://www.reddit.com/r/washingtondc/s/cmcG5VNgB0 and another post about Warren County, VA closing the Front Royal Public Library because they have LGBTQ books. That’s a bit closer than the Middle East.

Nah, they're not hurting anyone

Commies are always the first snitches, another good example

So do people not study and work in your world?

That sentence… doesn’t sound like what you mean it to

Please. You aren’t getting thrown of rooftops or sterilized or imprisoned. This victim mentality is pathetic.

I suggest you read about how they throw gays off buildings in other countries. Orange man will be gone in four years. You're fine.

Unfortunately it doesn’t go through their heads :/

Yeah, let's just wait until it gets to that ... Keep licking that boot.

You trump boot lickers love making up fake scenarios in order to feel persecuted huh

I mean, I'd maybe clean it off myself because I disagree, but I'm not calling the police on anyone. Police show up, they make everything worse for everyone. I'm not going to subject another person to that, no matter what they're saying.

Answer the question. Dodging it just makes you look dumb because we both know the implication was just wrong.

It won’t ever get to that because you live in one of the most cushy countries in the world. One where you get to proudly encourage other people to vandalize their schools, while being too cowardly to do that yourself because you know it’d ruin your life. You’re not a victim. Just a pathetic man.

A game made entirely by GMU Graduates "Nekomancer of Nowhere" has a FREE DEMO on Steam RIGHT NOW

We're super greatful to all the amazing professors in the GMU Game Design program that helped us all get here! Check it out: [https://store.steampowered.com/app/3180290/Nekomancer\_of\_Nowhere/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3180290/Nekomancer_of_Nowhere/)

I played this at MAGfest! I had no idea it was by GMU grads. Awesome job, everyone - very fun concept!

This looks rad as hell! Very excited

I remember seeing a snippet of this game during the AVT commencement last spring!! Congratulations on the demo release!

Wow, it looks amazing! The artistry is top-notch. Well done ya’ll!

It’s an awesome game and they put a lot of sweat and passion into it. So proud to see them getting it out and doing well. Go wishlist it now and play the demo!

I want the bear in smash bros

I am excited to try it on my new PC! You all are having much more fun programming with your degree than I am, I went into federal contracting!

Great work guys!

Congratulations yall!

Doing what no other GMU grad has done and actually shipping a finished game /jk /jk Looks fantastic! I'll definitely keep an eye on it

I only have a mac -- can I play on that =)

I also got the chance to play it there! Awesome job.

We've come a long way since then! :3

Thank you Professor!!! :3

We can dream :3

Yep! We do have a Mac build :3

Yessss I just started getting back into my games and realized that so many games I want to play are not compatible to Mac 😭 but I don’t want to invest in more electronics when I have so little time to play as is

When did GMU shit posting start becoming actual OC? Good shit op.

They are so damn cute. They light up my mood on my way to classes.

Op this is so sweet and very well done! I love it!

I await the day we start naming them. Slowly attaching name badges so we can address them properly

This is cute af

Awww this adorable

I love this so much! So cute!!!

If the umbrella is over the cute bot, why does its top have rain splashes? 🤔 _(good stuff OP!)_

I love this! How long did it take you?

This is delightful.

This... this is beautiful!!! &#x200B;

This isn't a shitpost.

oh my god you're right 😅 i should really stop trying to draw at 3am, haha

Around 4 hours!

It makes sense to me. The robot could've already been in the rain for a bit before the person arrived with the umbrella.

The effect is one that indicates raindrops are splashing when they hit the surface, not of a prior exposure to rain. Hence why being under the cover of the umbrella makes this a minor oversight. Still great all around, I'm just a hard-ass.

RIP campus looking nice during these last few years

Okay best meme I’ve ever seen on this page 👏🏻👏🏻 if I wasn’t a broke college student I’d give you gold.

This is gold

May your exams be as good as this fucking meme because A+ 10/10 bro.

You win this is perfection

the best use of this meme yet

I thought George Masons campus was just a Starbucks parking lot in Nova 😂

Gonna call BS. We did get lucky that most of the construction was on the outskirts of campus for a few years (West Campus road, the new medical building) but campus has been consistently under construction for close to a decade if not longer. Before that was Fenwick construction which was just as ugly as it is now, and before that was Ike's and Taylor Hall. Before that was Exploratory, before that was all the other newish dorms and Merten Hall

It's the thought that counts. Don't worry.

This is for the dudes racing their loud cars in the middle of the night on Braddock

People think they 007

it's like they don't have work/school the next morning 💀

Everytime I rant about these people, I always manage to offend at least one person. Like okay we get it, you’re compensating.

Do they really choose Braddock? There’s a VA state police station literally on the road

I'd reccomend a pair of ear buds and some music you like. Sleep with those on and it should help. I use it every night in general because I have a hard time sleeping without the music now, but it might help your woes.

Most of the cars are actually inline 4 cylinders with an eco turbo. Only twice have I seen a legit sports car with a V8 cylinder engine on campus. That's the funny thing, alot of the mustangs on campus are just Ford Fiestas with a mustang frame. its even worse when its a Honda Civic

this happens constantly at the shenandoah parking deck

fuck exam, we live life quarter mile at a time. /s

*^(You must be...)* ***exhausted!***

It's only for show Not for actual racing

>Ford Fiestas with a mustang frame How do you come up with such bullshit, sir?

> eco turbo > V8 cylinder engine > Ford Fiestas with a mustang frame I’m sure this language sounds impressive to people who know nothing about cars, but to those who do- you sound like an imbecile lol.

I remember a post like that being downvoted. Dealt with someone playing the drums while in an exam yesterday.

It's already illegal, technically. [https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title46.2/chapter10/section46.2-1049/](https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title46.2/chapter10/section46.2-1049/) >§ 46.2-1049. Exhaust system in good working order. A. No person shall drive and no owner of a vehicle shall permit or allow the operation of any such vehicle on a highway unless it is equipped with an exhaust system in good working order and in constant operation to prevent excessive or unusual levels of noise, provided, however, that for motor vehicles, such exhaust system shall be of a type installed as standard factory equipment, or comparable to that designed for use on the particular vehicle as standard factory equipment or other equipment that has been submitted to and approved by the Superintendent or meets or exceeds the standards and specifications of the Society of Automotive Engineers, the American National Standards Institute, or the federal Department of Transportation.

That's even worse. Might as well grab a Bugatti Chiron shell and put in over a Honda Civic

Nah bro, just got sick of taking my car to get repaired for expensive prices. so decided to learn how a car functions, down to the most specific pieces. So now I can understand how to approach a car malfunction and what I can do to fix it. Also so I can do the same for others and friends

Looks like quite a bit of people disagree with you

Homie forgot to use context clues and forgot how to read at the same time. "Funny thing is, alot of the mustangs are 4 cylinders with eco turbos"... Mustangs on campus are essentially Ford Fiestas with a Mustang Frame" I'll forgive you

that's great!

If what you're saying is right, my whole life was a lie

Only twice you’ve seen a “legit sports car” with a V8 ~~cylinder~~ engine? What about the Porsche 911, Ford GT, and most German and JDM cars? Those all have some configuration of a six cylinder engine.

The law says it can't be louder than the standard factory exhaust so your factory installed sport exhaust may still not be legal if it's a factory option. Also what are the odds these people dont have something else going on that is a primary offense?

Nice taking it even further out of context. "Only twice have I seen a legit Mustang with V8 on campus" Go troll somewhere else

All hail GMU’s new celeb

Saw a piebald song sparrow on campus!!!!

I've never seen a bird like that in VA

OMG! What a cutie!

Where was this found? I am an avid birder

Bald Eagle mini-me

Aw adorable

Omg it's so cute

So cute! These are such lovely photos, too.

I’m so jealous!

Its a genetic mutation of a common song sparrow

Not op, but I saw this same bird on Friday. It was by the long wooden bridge in the wooded area past the mason pond parking deck

Song sparrow. Not house sparrow.

Thanks for pointing out the typo. I have fixed it now. Bird nerds unite

REMEMBER TO KILL THIS INVASIVE SPECIES!!! REMINDER THAT THE SPOTTED LANTERNFLIES ARE APPEARING ALL OVER CAMPUS AND SHOULD BE KILLED ON SIGHT!!! THEY ARE INVASIVE MAKE SURE TO DO YOUR PART!!!!!!

![gif](giphy|KAf66yGCa93uTqod1q)

I like to kill them using the animal crossing method--sneak up slowly then stomp in one quick movement.

It’s fall and those things still EXIST??

I didn’t know they were invasive, thinking about it I don’t remember seeing them when I was younger

Death to the spotted ones!

![gif](giphy|YYfEjWVqZ6NDG)

thank you for your service

If you wanna kill them for fun, exploratory hall has a bunch of 'em

What species is this?

![gif](giphy|KAf66yGCa93uTqod1q)

Mathematical ecology/applied math PhD here. Some species experience strong natural selection for rapidly increased fertility when population drops significantly, that's why big cities like New York City can never get rid of all their rats or other rodents. Also, insects reproduce on a scale several orders of magnitude greater than mammals and such. A few people smashing an insect here and there is pretty much a pointless endeavor.

Look guys I know it’s important to kill them in order to protect the environment but some of you guys are way too enthusiastic about it. Makes me a little suspicious

![gif](giphy|eHrSTH9DIZMs3k19xb)

Waste of time. They are here to stay

Thou shalt not kill

![gif](giphy|KAf66yGCa93uTqod1q|downsized)

They're EVERYWHERE if you check my profile I posted a picture of a tree outside of Southside I found on my way back to my hall yesterday

they were introduced to the US in the mid 2010s, only have been in VA for a couple years

I respect your opinion from one math major to another o>. I think if we truly are gonna do something about it, we need a schoolwide response, not just a few ppl killing them.

Oh so we should just NOT try and help the situation even if only a little? Shut your pessimistic ass the fuck up.

That must be true for humans too. I wonder what traits favor natural selection in our species when the population declines. I personally think it’s savagery and low inhibition that enables humans to reproduce during those times. I don’t think intelligence actually benefits humans in that darwinian aspect. Too high inhibition most the times in highly intelligent people to benefit the “fittest part”. Socially awkward can be a killer in those times too

You actually should, as they're invasive - they've multiplied in such large numbers due to having no natural predators here in the US, and have been consuming resources normally used by other insects So by not killing you're allowing non invasive species to die, which will then limit food for birds, killing birds, etc.- you kill a lot more creatures by not killing lanternflies than by killing them

The correct translation is Thou shalt not murder.

"For Superearth!!" idk I didn’t play halo

If you read my post, you are NOT helping the situation. You are literally having zero effect. Possibly a large scale chemical intervention would help, but those usually have unintended consequences.

Dont care didnt ask we should still try

Gathering drones would be better for this than chemicals probably, since everyone is chipping in ideas.

I cared but I didn't ask and he is right. sybau

Kallaco seems really suspicious and could be scamming GMU So as everyone is waiting for this supposed email from Kallaco for covid testing. My friends and I started looking into them, the more we look into this mystery company the more suspicious it looks. Here’s what we have found, good and bad: - The domain for their website is only 40 days old. - Their [website](https://kalla.co) looks like it was made on squarespace in 30 minutes. There are grammar errors and it looks more like a template than anything. - Their partner company “HealthECO” only has 11 followers on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/TheHealthEco?s=21) and joined in March 2020. (Could be a new social media campaign or something) - HealthECO partner Jami Youmans, when her picture is reverse image searched it only shows up on one website and its a Society for Physician Entrepreneurs that you can simply pay $100 to join. However, Her [Linked in page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jamiyoumans) checks out for HealthECO. - When we reverse searched some of the others pictured on their website. The results led us to 404 errors and dead websites. - Upon searching the CEO’s name “John Spivey, Kallaco” we can go to their empty [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/kallaco) profile where only 2 employees are listed and very little information is provided - There’s a [video](http://Www.vimeo.com/user78424920) about Kallaco but posted 4 weeks ago, and the CEO’s face is never shown. - At the end of the video he’s showcasing, what is supposedly the Kallaco app but when opened it asks if he wants to allow StrataClear permissions and after that the app showed a login page for Kallaco. However, when searched on the the app store for either name, nothing comes up. - When searching for “StrataClear” the only results are covid testing by other companies. - I called the phone number provided on their linkedin and was greeted by a bot with the usual “press 1 to so and so” but didn’t go any further than the automated response. - the fact that, apparently, they can ship covid tests within 24 hours of you requesting it, and anywhere in the country, seems too good to be true. - The people who are partnered can be found on Linkedin and their pages check out with the info on Kallaco. - Their motto is apparently: “The people we care about the most, are the people who care the most about their people” - VCU is apparently using Kallaco and people have been waiting weeks for their tests to even arrive. While this seems like a scam since we can’t find anything informative or reliable about Kallaco, most of the partners listed are real and their info checks out, but there are still a ton of red flags. Seems like GMU selected the lowest bidding company for Covid testing, and Kallaco is either a 4 week old startup company that is way over ambitious. Or its just a scam and GMU bought it. If it ends up not being a scam, realistically, I don’t think the tests will arrive before the August 5th deadline. I would highly recommend going and getting a test done with your primary care physician or find a health clinic that offers them and can be covered by your insurance. GMU started this process way too late with a company that probably can’t handle the high demand anyway. Stay safe everyone and lets hope this doesn’t turn into a crapshoot (this is GMU we’re talking about so we all know the odds of that) TL;DR Kallaco is a 4 week old startup company that is really suspicious and possibly over ambitious. Or it’s a scam. We’ll have to wait and see. Edit: grammar

So, in your footsteps here, I've decided to do some 'amateur investigative journalism' and see what I can find out. Gonna email the shit out of the VA Department of Health, the Fairfax County Health Department, and probably GMU as well. I'll post any responses I get here. Big props for doing the initial research, I wouldn't have thought twice about this Kallaco company without it.

Update: - Was previously called [StrataClear Solution LLC](https://www.environmental-expert.com/products/strataclear-carbon-dioxide-reduction-technology-262947) but the name changed to Kallaco on 7/7/2020. - The “CEO” has made countless LLC’s over the past years you can see the information [here](https://coraweb.sos.la.gov/commercialsearch/commercialsearch.aspx) to see the info about “Kallaco” use the “search by Entity name” and input “kallaco” To see his other LLC’s. Use the “search by Officer name” option and input his name: “John Spivey” - When you search the New Orleans address (5414 Constance street) listed on the website above its actually a run down looking house. - He has 28 different LLC’s under his name some of which are still active (one of them being Kallaco) Here are all of the LLC’s under John Spivey the “CEO of Kallaco”: SPIVEY, JOHN Agent of “S6-LZS, LLC” NEW ORLEANS SPIVEY, JOHN Member of “S6-LZS, LLC” NEW ORLEANS SPIVEY, JOHN Agent of “S6-RBT, LLC” NEW ORLEANS SPIVEY, JOHN Member of “S6-RBT, LLC” NEW ORLEANS SPIVEY, JOHN Agent of “S6 HOLDINGS, LLC” NEW ORLEANS SPIVEY, JOHN Member of “S6 HOLDINGS, LLC” NEW ORLEANS SPIVEY, JOHN Agent of “S6 - SHP LLC” NEW ORLEANS SPIVEY, JOHN Member of “S6 - SHP LLC” NEW ORLEANS SPIVEY, JOHN Agent of “SHP MANAGEMENT GROUP, LLC” NEW ORLEANS SPIVEY, JOHN Manager of “SHP MANAGEMENT GROUP, LLC” NEW ORLEANS SPIVEY, JOHN Agent of “SPIVEY & COMPANY, INC.” NEW ORLEANS SPIVEY, JOHN President of “SPIVEY & COMPANY, INC.” NEW ORLEANS SPIVEY, JOHN Director of “SPIVEY & COMPANY, INC.” NEW ORLEANS SPIVEY, JOHN Manager of “ENGAGEDX, LLC” NEW ORLEANS SPIVEY, JOHN Manager of “ENGAGESP, LLC” NEW ORLEANS SPIVEY, JOHN Agent of “ENGAGEU, LLC” NEW ORLEANS SPIVEY, JOHN Manager of “ENGAGEU, LLC” NEW ORLEANS SPIVEY, JOHN Agent of “UNO HEALTH INTERNATIONAL INC.” NEW ORLEANS SPIVEY, JOHN President of “UNO HEALTH INTERNATIONAL INC.” NEW ORLEANS SPIVEY, JOHN Agent of “ENGAGEDX, LLC” NEW ORLEANS SPIVEY, JOHN Agent of “ENGAGESP, LLC” NEW ORLEANS SPIVEY, JOHN Manager of “SUMMIT HEALTH STRATEGIES, LLC” NEW ORLEANS SPIVEY, JOHN Agent of “AVAILIANT HEALTHCARE STRATEGIES, LLC” NEW ORLEANS SPIVEY, JOHN Manager of “AVAILIANT HEALTHCARE STRATEGIES, LLC” NEW ORLEANS SPIVEY, JOHN Agent of “KALLACO, LLC” NEW ORLEANS SPIVEY, JOHN Manager of “KALLACO, LLC” NEW ORLEANS SPIVEY, JOHN PAUL Member of “DZS LAND & MINERALS, LLC” COLLEGE STATION SPIVEY, JOHN W.

Yeah that sounds sketchy as hell. Thanks for compiling the facts though, I’ll pass this along to any curious friends.

Always has been

I can’t believe VCU is really using this scam to get tests. With just a few clicks anyone can see how sketchy this company is; they’re putting a lot of people at risk for getting their information stolen. Even if it is an ‘ambitious startup,’ there’s no way stuff wouldn’t check out like it did here. Personally I think it was only a matter of time for these companies to appear. They’re basically data mining but with serious personal information like health insurance, Social Security Numbers, etc (if they ask for it.) A lot of people who are desperate to get a test are likely to go to these kinds of sites and spill their information, and they probably wouldn’t think twice about it. It’s really just like a phone scam. It makes me nervous for other schools and their faction and staff who will be just like VCU in the next coming months.

Has anyone considered contacting GMU with these concerns? Like the Health Services people? My dad even suggested getting in touch with 7 On Your Side (the news people) with this stuff.

From a [University of Mississippi Alumi page](https://southernstudies.olemiss.edu/people/alumni/alumni-in-business-from-summer-2013-southern-register/): John Spivey has been building technology-related startups since he earned his Southern Studies degree in 1994. “I’ve had some great successes and some unfortunate failures, but that’s the nature of the entrepreneurial world,” he says. Don't want to add more fuel to this conspiracy fire too much, but damn I would hate to see GMU's COVID testing on a list of this dude's "unfortunate failures" :/

So did mason send all of our emails to this company that could potentially be a scam!

Just reported this to ABC 7's team

The “tests ship within 24 hours” part seemed wayyy to good to be true as well as the turnaround. They were smart about offering cheap prices to schools like GMU knowing they don’t actually care about their students! 100% getting an independent test now

So I would strongly suggest and encourage people to get a test done not through Kallaco if you're able to. Since we all pretty sure it's a scam it would be best to get a test done else where so you're still able to go on campus when we all move it. Side note I would love to see the long email Mason sends that could easily be summed up by saying "oops it was a scam, sorry guys" big L

>Their [website](https://kalla.co/) looks like it was made on squarespace in 30 minutes. There are grammar errors and it looks more like a template than anything. If you view source on their web page you can see it was created with WordPress. That's some low-budget web development. The "we're hiring" link takes you to a simple contact us form. No address or phone numbers anywhere to be found. I have used local services in my area that have 2 or fewer employees that have more polished and useful websites. I wouldn't trust a lawn service with a web site like this to mow my lawn, much less handle medical testing for the largest university in the state of Virginia. Good work, OP! Thanks for digging into this!

To anyone trying to login using the info they sent you have to use an @gmu.edu email (not a masonlive.gmu.edu email - even if that’s your Mason email). This doesn’t seem too sus considering the washing machine system does the same thing. It’s still really sketch though so I’m not saying it’s a good idea

iClickers, textbooks, lab fees during online classes, and out of state tuition is also a scam

Lmao sounds a lot like that company the administration paid $55mill to for masks but they never delivered... with all the security funding you would think these institutions would be a lot more careful

Hello! I'm a VCU student and we also used Kallaco. We got our testing kits, but it gets even worse. A lot of us got our results back negative, moved in thinking we were clear, and then looked at our results page to see our tests suddenly changed from cleared to pending. In my case, mine went from negative to sample rejected. So now we have no idea if we're actually clear or not and might have just exposed each other and may be the start of an outbreak in Richmond. This company is not to be trusted. Good luck GMU friends!

Hey there, just wanted to drop in to share what I know thus far. I have twins heading to college as freshmen; 1 to VCU & the other to GMU. The test kit for the VCU kid was ordered Sat 7/25 and arrived in the evening via FedEx on Wed. 7/29. Test kit ordered for GMU kid on Tues 7/28 and waiting for arrival. So, we **did** actually receive the kit as well, and hopefully, everything else (results) is legit. With that said, I wanted to just throw a few tips out there for those that may be confused by the terrible instructions enclosed with the kit. The test itself is an easy throat swab, be careful not to spill the liquid in the tube. Wash hands, swab the throat, stick it in the tube, break it off at the perforation (take the lid off the tube just prior to swabbing), put the lid on. Voila, that part's easy. The slightly confusing part is the labeling as the directions are far from clear. On the enclosed paper, there is a small sticker with the student's name and DOB preprinted. Write the date and time of swab on the lab request form **AND ON THE LITTLE STICKER**. (There is no blank for it, just write in on there) You do **not** have to write on the label that is already on the tube! You will remove the sticker (with name, DOB, time & date) and **cover up the sticker already on the tube**. I promise this is the way to do it even though the enclosed instructions really do suck and are unclear. I have been an RN for over 25 years and the process is pretty standard for any specimen labeling. I hope everyone gets their kits, gets negative results, and is able to venture off to college. For all the Freshmen out there, may the force be with you. You'll have had the most challenging HS senior year/summer/start of the college experience, I can't imagine how crazy this must be for you all. Best of luck to everyone out there! Stay safe!

I *just* got the email though.

As someone without a primary care physician or health insurance, this is just golden.

Yeah so got the email, website sucks, agreement is suspicious as heck, buttons don’t even work for the health monitoring, the banner at the bottom blocks the buttons.

Can anyone else find the app we're supposed to get all of out test results from? I googled "Kallaco app" on Google and nothing even comes up; I even did it on the app store. Am I blind or missing something?

wait I signed up earlier today! Now what ?? this is about covid testing email right?

We had to take our test at VCU through Kallaco and they told us we would receive our test in 2 business days but it actually took a whole week. The test actually got sent to the lab in one day and I got my results in 2 business days but the next business day Kallaco changed my negative result to processing which I heard this happening to other Vcu students too. They’re also pretty hard company to reach, the instructions for our test we’re not clear at all so I had to ask my university for more help. I hope they’re legit...

Shit... I sent my test 2 days ago. I figured I could trust VCU on this, but I guess it’s another case of always do your own research.

I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit: - [/r/vcu] [The covid testing service being used by gmu and vcu and other schools (idk which ones) seems to a bit fishy after some people did some digging.](https://www.reddit.com/r/vcu/comments/i0w4tm/the_covid_testing_service_being_used_by_gmu_and/) &nbsp;*^(If you follow any of the above links, please respect the rules of reddit and don't vote in the other threads.) ^\([Info](/r/TotesMessenger) ^/ ^[Contact](/message/compose?to=/r/TotesMessenger))*

I found the company on LinkedIn and they supposedly have 11-50 employees. Correct me if I don’t understand that (I’m a rising freshman at W&M), but that doesn’t match up with the scale of their customer base. Link: https://www.linkedin.com/company/kallaco?trk=public_profile_experience-item_result-card_subtitle-click

It’s a tracking app. Once you do the testing and download the app, your school can track exactly where you are and even set the system up to alert the dean (or whoever) that too many students are gathering together. So, if your school is adding this app to their conduct code requirement, you are, in all likelihood, giving the school permission to track your phone. Watch the sales video and it explains how students are tracked. If your school is chill and won’t bring you up on conduct charges for being at a party that has too many students then no biggie. But, if your school is aggressive with policy, you should be aware of what this app is and can do with your info. https://vimeo.com/434498160

Not GMU but William and Mary is also using this and man does it look alarming

The Kallaco Test (ThermoFisher TaqPath COVID-19 Combo Kit) was NOT EUA-approved by the FDA for home specimen collection. (Read the full FDA email here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lJttIV6fDHUGRFm44-wIH85LGLWee1ei/view?link_id=0&can_id=e27329b886928744f73825c77c92b8e3&source=email-concerns-about-faulty-testing-of-students-at-mason&email_referrer=email_899490&email_subject=gmu-aaup-response-to-president-washington-re-kallaco-testing The CDC has published guidelines for collecting COVID-19 samples. This CDC document explicitly states that oropharyngeal (OP) specimens (i.e., throat swabs) must be collected by healthcare providers to be acceptable. By contrast, the Kallaco-ThermoFisher test kit required students to perform an oropharyngeal (OP) specimen collection (throat swab) at home, in violation of CDC guidelines. For the full guidelines visit: https://bit.ly/3j59iYw On August 17, 2020, the FDA released an advisory titled “Risk of Inaccurate Results with ThermoFisher Scientific TaqPath COVID-19 Combo Kit” (the now-infamous Kallaco test). This advisory was released to alert “clinical laboratory staff and health care providers of a risk of false results with Thermo Fisher Scientific TaqPath COVID-19 Combo Kit.” The full FDA advisory can be found here: https://bit.ly/2EnuKc9.

Lol this is wild

William & Mary student here--- we're planning to use this platform as well and a lot of us are also concerned about the sketchiness of this company. I'm sending some concerns and questions to the W&M town hall that's being hosted tonight, and I'l post an update if anything comes of it. Hopefully they can clear things up

I waited for WEEKS to receive my test and only after countless emails did they finally decide to overnight ship one out to me. I sent it back the same day (this was last week). I still have yet to hear back from them. Keep in mind, people have already moved in and my first day of class is in 4 days.

Hi, I'm a journalist with RVA Mag. Many of the posts in this thread are very concerning. Does anyone have any updates on Kallaco? If you would like to speak with me for an article please email ClaytonWickhamRVA@gmail.com.

Maybe contact some local news stations to get their investigation teams on it as well.

I checked out the address on google, the house across the street is the run down duplex but it’s actually blurred out on street view. It’s listed on realtor.com and actually looks decent, but it’s sketch why the house would be blurred out

Yeah, good on OP and their friends for researching all of this. I still haven't gotten my email from Kallaco despite GMU's promise of it arriving today.

The fact that any of the affected universities made this gamble without looking into it is concerning. Also I just got an email but im hesitant to do it

A southern studies major with a medical start up companies and several other earth science start ups... my Theranos senses are tingling

No idea what information was passed over to Kallaco but I do not recommend doing tests through them even if an email comes out.

I sent an email to the News 4 I-Team

https://vimeo.com/434498160

Life saver right here.

We all did. Proceed at your own risk

So weird, just as I was reading your post the email came. Thanks for putting this out, I'm going to look into testing somewhere else now if I can...

I had to submit the health check through my mobile browser. It didn't work for my friend on desktop either

It’s funny that this is also the same app they told us we need to start using a week before to log our symptoms daily. If Kallaco made their website as bad as everyone says it is I’m really interested on how they’re going to put out an iPhone compatible app in two weeks.

From what I’ve found the app doesn’t exist, or you have to get a “special link” to download it

Its about the company who is doing the covid testing for mason. But yes its who sent the email to everyone

Looks like Mason PD forgot to [INSERT descriptions] in their emails lmao Looks like Mason PD forgot to add descriptions in their email

It’s like they buttdialed an automatic email to the university

Literally can’t even proof read a real emergency notification. God forbid if it was an active shooter on campus and we see this shit instead of actual information. How to create more confusion and risk lives 101

Literally came here to say this😂 like okayyyy any info would be helpful lmaoo

Hahaha. Im trying to find the details of the person, but I guess all of us are lost.

two juveniles wearing all black

bruh this cant be real loll

Saw that lol

We got gta 6 live simulation before gta 6

BOTTOM TEXT

What if it was actually an active shooter, maybe this officer was witnessing or next to, and doing their best?

It seems that they used an AI chat bot to write it for them, but I didn't remember to add the information needed 💀

show this to my research professor

Weird, the text message I got displayed just fine.

I saw that and was like someone sent send too quick loool

This is really the best they can do? What a joke. So glad this is my last semester

Hey guys ima transfer student coming into the spring semester. Any idea of how long it takes for your housing application?

George Mason University is seeking assistance in locating an active shooter last seen at \[INSERT location\] and armed with \[INSERT weapon\]. So far, \[INSERT number of dead\] people have been pronounced dead on the scene. If you have any info, please contact us at \[INSERT number\].

Honestly. Like take your job seriously? Please?

RIP to all the juveniles that happen to be wearing all black but are completely uninvolved

Is this what the youths say? 😂

I’ve once emailed a professor saying that I wouldn’t be in class bc I straight up wasn’t having a good time. She was so nice about it too

This is definitely what the youths say lmao

:( I feel them

This is a mood

Isn’t it pronounced “yutes”?

Nah, we joke about suicide

His honesty is something refreshing. I hope he gets better soon 😕

Me as a professor

Only for a pair, thus two yutes.

I have bad news about the fox on campus The fox was unfortunately struck and killed by someone’s car outside Rappahannock Parking Deck. This fox was really something special on campus, always making talk of the town, and it’s really unfortunate that it’s gone.

🕯️🕯️🕯️ 🦊🪦🦊 🕯️🕯️🕯️ RIP Campus Fox 2024-2024 The mascot we didn’t have, but the mascot we needed.

MAKE THE DRIVING TEST HARDER PLEASE

is this serious?? like fr??

Well there goes my only joy in life.

wanted: gmu student who killed a fox at Rappahannock parking deck

NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

Welp……time to drop out

This little guy chased me for about 200 meters when I was leaving the campus late on my scooter a couple of weeks ago. I did get away, but looking at the posts and comments, it seems like he was a sweet guy and maybe just wanted to be friendly and not pounce on me🥺. Makes me so sad. RIP litte fella

We can’t have anything nice :(

Noooo!! I was afraid something like this would happen. DWR should have come in and relocated the fox to a safer environment.

BRO WHATTT??? Wow.. honestly I dont understand how people cant just USE their breaks they work:/ We should give him a funeral

When’s the funeral 😭😭😭😭

Please please please no! I saw her for the first time two days ago, just minding her little foxy business!!!! 😭😭😭😭

Which side of rap deck? Towards the pd or towards the dorms?

NAME AND SHAME

He was the only thing keeping us sane

Bro what? :(

It's so over.

Are we holding a vigil?

I saw it and was about to post about it, some people really shouldn't have a driver's license...

Ohh noo... he made me happy.

praying for that students downfall 😤🙏

My day is so fucking ruined. I wanna cry wtf.

Awww...saddened but not surprised. Foxes are fairly common vehicle strike victims up here. I almost saw one (not sure if the same one; there's multiple in the area) bite it on Roberts Road coming into campus this other day.

This so freaking sad 😢 I can’t believe it

NOOO I NEVER GOT TO MEET HER

Can anyone confirm new sightings? I ran into the fox about 20 times, I am sure it was the same fox unless they were siblings. I thought it was just 1 fox.

Please say psych rn

Fake news, I saw him… Pete is alive!

Yes he was really was killed unfortunately!

First it was Harambe....

This is so sad :(((

I need proof

There were two foxes. Now it’s one

Sorry to hear that.

Not surprised. I called it a few days back and people downvoted when I said it should’ve been relocated but the armchair biologist said that it belonged here and it was okay

Dicks out for Gunstonbae

death penalty for the driver

Yes, it is real.

He just wanted to play :(

Towards the PD

Yeah, I would agree. There are some awful drivers on campus who act like the vehicle has the right of way before a pedestrian. The driving exam needs to become difficult to obtain to keep these likes of these people off the road. I also think there should be something done about the individuals with the loud exhausts on campus revving their engines at 2am at Rapp deck and infront of the ACGC, especially that stupid little white Fiat 500c. I wish MasonPD was more stringent on these 1.0 GPA activity people

Agree, I was almost got hit while crossing the four way stop on campus…. Some people are just wreckless

Even though it hurts our heart, I'm sure the student didn't mean to intentionally kill it. He / She feels just as guilty and probably loved the fox just as much as us . 🥲 Let's be forgiving. It was in the fox's destiny to live this long...

Hope they fail all their finals

There’s two foxes apparently so one of them is alive

It was born here... it is biology.

our beloved georgina

Realised it too late :(

If u think he accidentally killed an animal that large in a parking lot then ur delusional. If it was on a highway ok, in a parking garbage no

missing hello all. i moved in today and somehow lost my childhood stuffed animal and it holds very sentimental value to me. I live in dominion hall 4th floor, if anyone sees him please let me know:(

Upvote to bring our boy home

I promise I may have saw it in Johnson center trash can. Someone had a lost and found bin they dumped. It’s the one by the bookstore

hello everyone:D my boy has been found thank you all!!

I will make sure to keep an eye out in case I can find him

Bring him home!

Any update?!

I personally haven’t seen him but I’ll keep my eyes open for him the next time I’m on campus.

I'll keep my eyes open, esp since we're on the same floor

BRING HIM HOME!!!!

I don't even go to GMU and I'm really not sure why this is on my feed but!! I'm so glad you found him :) I would be devastated if I lost my childhood stuffie so I left it at home 💔

Idk why this reminded of Bing Bong from Peak… I might be cooked in the head.

OH NO! I really hope that isn't the case.....

Where was he?

he has been found!!! :D

How it feels walking to classes on a windy day

The wind makes my face CRUSTY ASF 😭🙏🙏

Hahahahaa you’re fine I’m just remembering how Ahsoka lectured Mando

I really hope the pass/fail or universal pass system happens. But I bet it won’t because...GMU

Welcome to the club lmao

That’s not okay...

Same!! I feel like they’re setting us up now for failure.

I’m all for the universal pass

gmu if it was in an anime

Okay this is actually a nice picture ???

Damn that's good now hire some people and get a story line, and make fun of GMU ofc

Now we need a minecraft one

This is pretty solid

This is beautiful! I swear that pond has never been that clear or blue.

I’d put this on my wall

The plot would be fighting off bears on campus

be sure to add bears everywhere instead of student npcs

It’s the reflection of the blue sky.

With parking passes for some reason

Fighting off geese

Definitely have some type of episode where university mall movie theatre’s website.

Visited the new logo yesterday it was surrounded by a group of students who said things like “general motors” “it looks like a corporate logo”

Not advocating or encouraging anything but in case anyone is curious the statue has wheels under the base so it can be moved around, they're probably locked but with a few people it can be moved around .....

Happy my diploma has the old logo. Bc this shi is ugly

I wish more people add sticky notes to the point it covers the entire logo

Signed by your mom LMAO

Will the admin pull a "New Coke" and bring back the classic logo, therefore satisfying everyone by doing essentially nothing?

![gif](giphy|26gR2DCgCb6hOQdLa)

Great reminder that you attend a machine focused on selling classes for profit.

Guys you didnt hear it from me, but if enough people keep complaining about the logo theyre gonna change it. If people dont like it enough noone will buy any new merch😭

This is the actual Waste Management of W&M. **SCREAMS IN MATTHEW BERRY QUOTES**

what was the reason they changed the logo?

Call University alumni relations and get a vote of disapproval on the books. I'm getting this fucking thing changed if it's the last interaction I get to make with these fuckers.

Oh man, it would be such a shame if someone was walking around with a few gallons of paint and accidentally tripped and spilled it all over the new logo.

This has to be some type of money laundering operation. Why was so much money spent designing this basic logo?

Love General Motors new headquarters

Some admin got too excited with the AI logo generator.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/pallvin wrote a post about launching it, and outside of the CEO/Influencer circle jerking, there was a lot of people who showed disdain at the whole process. They’ve seemingly deleted all of their reply’s because it included one that was, and I have to paraphrase, “We did all this work over three years, thousands of touch points and surveys. It’s also hard to make a brand because it’s gotta go on merch. You’ll always have haters” (again, not a quote) So that’s the reason it looks so bland and cost so much. They settled on beige milk-toast and celebrate it as a huge win.

Take it up with the chair of the department.

Refinement cultures latest victim :(

It’s the same handwriting 👀

~~GM?~~ More like WM because it belongs in the garbage.

My dad hated the old logo but he hates this one even more. Immediately said it looks like General Motors

Uglier than the old one

What was the old logo??

Does it really matter?

I don't think it's that bad

I guess unpopular opinion, but I like it.

Personally think it looks great. Not sure what all the uproar is about.

my undergrad has the old logo but my grad one will have this one 🤢

They changed it on LinkedIn, so now your education shows the new logo there :(

At this point we need sharpies

I wish, there were a lot yesterday but Office of University Branding has been removing the sticky notes at the end of the day

They don’t care what students think

I don’t understand why they didn’t have students compete to submit a winning design.

What sucks is, a lot of merch is being bought right now because of Spring 2024 graduation. They unveiled the logo just at the right time 🙄 many of the graduates' families are buying merch for the new graduates either without realizing the logo changed or that everyone hates the logo. My MIL got me a shirt for my graduation and it has the new logo on it, of course I have to wear it because it's a gift, but man really don't like repping the new 'GM'...

This may be a collaboration with John Deere.

They didn’t clearly, we would have been more creative

No, but what does is the boat load of money they spent on this!

It’s time to transfer! /s (sorta kinda)

I would love to know what they wrote.

Write the complaints on blank stickers so it's more of a pain to remove

How much did they spend?

I agree that it's boring, but at least somebody got paiidd. (Could've been spent better, but this town is the king of administrative waste)

I heard 500K on commissioning the design. 18K for the metal box for the reveal. And 5 Million for total rebranding, like signs and merchandise and stuff. I couldn't find the cost publicly available online, but some of the students got crafty, found the info, and have been telling everyone.

Coming back to campus and seeing that half the buildings are demolished and robots are living among us

I was walking around camp before class today and saw a cop stopping traffic for a white robot rover. What a time to be alive.

One of them was spinning in a circle on the walkway at the intersection and people in their cars were getting mad lol

Me : Goes to school for electrical engineering. School : gets taken over by robots. Me : [:0](https://i.imgur.com/HAPqzQX.png)

We are in the endgame now.

I, for one, welcome our new robot overlords.

Congratulations, Mason grad! Now please get back here and clean this up.

The worst are those who throw the shiny plastic confetti. That stuff will never degrade. During my first spring semester at GMU, I saw a bunch of grads having their pictures taken while throwing the confetti up into the air. I came back over summer break to get some stuff done in the library, and a lot of that confetti was still there.

Kinda embarrassing, why wouldn't they think of that beforehand?

I really hope those geese in the back don’t end up eating some of the confetti. This is just embarrassing

And Mason Pond was looking so beautiful lately... It's a shame

For cute, colorful and PLANET SAFE confetti use shaped hole punches for colored leaves and flower petals!!!

Saw this by the steps by Exploratory. Infuriated me as well.

Why not just throw birdseed?

BuT iTs FoR tHe GrAm

I can't think of a better candidate for a littering citation.

College degrees are overrated anyway. lol

I'm gonna go out on a limb and say thinking didn't factor into this decision at all.

Its not they didn't or wouldn't think about it, it's that they simply don't care.

They didn't think about it after, either...

wait that’s genius

who cares about the environment when you can be ✨pretty✨ /s i hate confetti. it’s impossible to clean up completely, and once it’s wet it’s game over.

What do you expect from GMU grads?! /s (am one)

Would you call him a clanker? 😔

NOOO please don't call our sweetie pies slurs 😭😭😭

Starships are the good, happy little robots among us. Be kind!

Nah, they the good ones

To their face

I call them Mason Minions (MM)

yes. little dumbasses always stopping in my path whenever anything exists in their vicinity

One of them slept with my wife when I was away at work. So yes, 100%

don’t call them slurs😭

[Here's some new branding for them xD](https://imgur.com/a/C6NshWF)

Back in my day, we didn’t need no tin-skinned clanker to do our deliveries for us!

I’ve heard the c word thrown around at least twice on campus so far so we’re off to a good start

Without remorse

never ever those are my sons

I always move out the way for them, they’re just trying to help feed the campus 😭

Baby marshmallows 💖💖💖💖😭🎀

Every time I see one of those, I want to flip it over and turtle it so it can’t move

Was thinking about this too..... at least they're useful

Fucking Clankers!!!

Yes, hard C

Zappies IRL 😬

Clanker, science project, tin rusters

Took this at pond deck today, thought is was pretty cool.

This is a perfect image to show to a college student who isn’t having a good day or is going through something. There’s always a rainbow after the storm :)

Saw it!!! So pretty

can confirm, this is pretty cool

Very epic my guy

so pretty!!

Beautiful, nice shot

One of God's greatest hits

The harsh reality

We actually are covered by the next stimulus package, if it passes senate.

There's no way it passes the senate in this current form - if it does, I'll be..flabbergasted? I'm not against it, but it almost seems *way* too good to be true for people within the typical college-age range. For those who are wondering - the part we care about sums up to qualifying individuals (including college students) receiving up to $2000 a month (for at least 6 months) until the employment-to-population ratio for those over the age of 16 is greater than 60%. Perhaps I'm just being cynical because I've been working my ass off full-time for a little over 70% of that during my entire college career, but that amount coming to fruition would literally blow my mind.

Honestly it's like they go through every possible scenario to make sure you can't get your hands on some money, no loop holes nothing.

You do get temporary student loan forgiveness. No payments due and no interest until October of this year. It's pretty nice

To be fair, most dependents legitimately don’t need the stimulus check (hence the title, dependent). Also the $500 would go to those claiming you as a dependent if you were 16 or under, not to you (however it does seem kinda dumb to exclude people 17 or older from getting their parents the bonus).

At least I got $500 from my tax refund!

Okay but if they're claimed as dependents that means that they're already getting help from their parents anyway so where's the issue? In order to be claimed as a dependent half your living expenses have to be paid for. That almost certainly adds up to more than $1200 per year.

We don’t have the sufficient number of cronies in Congress. It won’t pass.

It won't pass without major overhaul

$600 a week? That can't be right... that's basically my salary and I make $20/hour working full time...

I started working winter break, dont qualify for unemployment as I havent been working long enough, feelsbad

Spoken like someone born with a silver spoon in your mouth. Now, it's not necessarily fair for me to judge you based upon the comment, but the simple fact is that "dependent" simply means you are supported in some way or at least someone is "claiming" they are supporting you. But an extremely poor family can still "support" a college-age student in enough qualifying ways while that student is working 40 hours a week and in school part-time and barely scraping by because the family is quite poor to begin with. In large part, such a situation is often created due to "loans" of some sort when it comes to paying for school. In other words, being a "dependent" has zero bearing on whether or not someone might need a stimulus check.

Isn't the goal to become independant? Generally, somebody that is dependant on someone else is dependant because they don't have the resources to support themselves. Having enough money to get your feet off of the ground really helps somebody become independant.

“Most dependents” data?

It passed house already. Both the treasury and Trump have helped Dems push this bill. Any stimulus will be approved by the executive since it makes Trump look good by giving people free money. I would be shocked if the senate kills this bill since it’ll make them also look good.

If young people want political representation, we have to VOTE!

Yeah, I was expecting about $500-$700 from the previous one. Perhaps it has to do with being used to my current financial situation, but this amount would feel very strange to have coming in from seemingly out of nowhere. I can see this being a lifesaver for those who have lost their jobs due to the quarantine, but for me it just feels..extra? Guess my next semester's tuition is on the government.

It is only through July 31st. In my state you can get $300 a week max for unemployment, but the $600 is an additional amount provided on the federal level. So if/when I get furloughed ill be making $900 a week (more than my partner who is a teacher) while unemployed, but only through July 31st. My father owns a company and has had issues with employees trying to get laid off because they can make more while not working and they don't really plan farther ahead than a month so the July 31st end date doesn't seem to compute.

Just apply, the worst thing that happens is you get told no. You can do it online.

No, because it's not technically a job. We're registered for a credit and paid as a scholarship. Logistically, we were never employed at all. Also, we work on a semesterly basis anyway. Your job naturally ends at the agreed-upon point, which also means it doesn't qualify for unemployment.

Ask someone from the unemployment agency not a random reddit user for real answers

We’re in the weirdest timeline, and they’ve killed rational bills before. If you read Trump’s Twitter feed (strange times for news) you should see him taking a few potshots at dems for some of the riders-on to that bill. That being said if they’ve teamed up, it might happen. No way to know though.

Can you link a source? I want to see the details for myself.

You are correct, it’s not rolled out yet in our state. Edit: Fuck me it got rolled out today.

MRW I pass my last exam and have completed the requirements for my CS degree.

Big mood. Good shit, homie

Congrats my man!

Woooohoooooo :D

Ay, congratulations! And best of luck on getting a job rn, shit's crazy but CS demand is probably through the roof.

Just waiting for my grades to come in before I celebrate lol

Congratulations you deserve it haha hope you live it up!

Congratulations!

That's awesome; you're awesome;

You lucky son of a bitch.

Up top. Let's go my man.

Congrats bro

Nicely done bud

I wish I could feel that feeling but I gotta be patient. 😤

What does MRW stand for?

Always a pleasure to see an IT ganger have top comment on a CS post ❤️👌

My application to graduate finally processed. I'm a computer scientist now my dudes.

I have a question, let’s say I’m supposed to graduate this Fall 2020, when am I supposed to apply to graduate? Please and thank you!

So post graduation task of getting a job in your field: honestly just apply even if they want more experience. I got a software engineering job within 2 years of graduating and I applied everywhere. Beforehand I just worked part time. Don't worry about experience. If it comes down to it, don't be afraid to go through a recruiting agency. They can find you positions a lot quicker than you can on your own. Within 2 days of applying, I had several interviews that they found me eligible for. You got this dude.

Good luck on your journey to getting an entry level position that requires 5 years experience in C, C++, Java, Python, JavaScript, HTLM, CSS, Fortran, Full stack development, Word, and Excel all for $8/hr plus free snacks. Jk congratulations

Congrats! Where in patriot web is that page?

Cum Laude in CS!? Boss.

Now this is epic 😎

Congrats dude 🎉 Now you can say "trust me I'm an engineer"

Congratulations!!! I am waiting for that day too!!

👏🏾👏🏾 congrats!!

Congratulations! :-)

It’s lit, gratz bro

congrats!!!!!!!

Congratulations!

Can you do my cs work, I’m trying to become a cyse but I can’t do python.

Congrats. Want a bj?

AAAAAAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYE congrats bro much love

When I was younger I thought it was pronounced "cum loud" and was very confused

Honestly I have the same question ^ I think there’s something about applying for graduation at the start the fall semester (in patriotweb?)

lmao The fortran part made me laugh

Unofficial transcript

I was on the GI bill. No student loans for me.

What’s bj ?

Magnum Cum Loud 💦💦💦🍆

Yeah, do it early.

If you don't have 30 years of Cobol and Fortran experience you're not hireable

Yeah similar question, upon applying early do you mean now or at the start of the semester? Thanks!

Don't forget about the 26 years of MUMPS, Ada, Pascal, and Haskell. Don't even bother if you can't write an interpreter for brainfuck.

Start of the semester should be ok, but I don't really know. It's a question for an advisor I guess.

The new brick path to Southside

Mark this post NSFW cuz this is basically porn!

Great! Now I can better people-watch from the ellipticles.

That’s great. If only I were to visit campus anytime soon....

should’ve tagged as spoilers lol, but it looks good and i am glad that at least the construction is able to continue

I actually like it a lot

i don't have any classes on campus this semester, but i kinda wanna pay a visit one weekend and just walk around to see how much construction has progressed. i keep seeing pics that look really nice!

How ironic that we suffered through all this construction, never to experience the end result.

Not gonna lie. I miss the old path, the small slope. But this looks cool I guess. I’m glad they’re done with it so I don’t have to circle around to get to classes— oh wait.

I give those bricks 10/10

Do you have any more pics of the construction progress so far? I miss campus 😭

Skating is gonna be brrrrrrrrrr

Thank you so much for posting this, the cam doesn't show this part of the construction

is the jc open?

Literally haven't been able to walk there since my freshman year. And now it's back, in full glory. 11/10, would walk again.

Mason construction: 1 General inconveniences caused by the construction: ♾

Every brick could have contributed to another scholarship for a student, and now we walk on the choices to not support their hopes and dreams.

I'm still not going to Southside. Ike's is wayyyy better

It’s quite a detour just to get to the older buildings and SUB1 cause the intersection is closed. In fact they also moved the statue in between Music Theater and Mason Hall.

The only other photo I took today is of the new Horizon Building which I can say is almost complete. But I think somebody else already posted an updated photo of the building on this subreddit not too long ago.

I don't think so. When I passed by it appeared to be dark inside so I didn't think it was worth checking.

Each brick laid on this path represents the lost hopes and dreams of grad students. May we tread on the path with honor and care.

It feels great, does it not? Then you can finish the walk by stopping at mason pond and looking at the lake paid for with the tears of grad students forced into near slavery ahhh i love that smell in the morning

I'll go in with a growler for milk and and a tub for rice, now if only I could dress as an employee and walk in.

Wow, it's like you know me or truly understand. That's nice. Thank you.

One of the things keeping me going in all of my classes.

Or someone’s dog!

i only have one class that meets on zoom where we're required to have our cams on, but in that class, if i see a cat i'm enlarging that person's video feed for as long as it's there. professor < cat

MATH 213 with Lukyanenko Started last class with a "Cat Cam" as I called it

My math teacher last year has 8 cats and they literally just sat on her desk the entirety of class. Only thing that kept me going back to that class for a while

We stan Stella

I knew someone would bring up Neary and Stella(or Pip as he made an appearance today)

Facts! It’s just cats are more likely to jump in front of the camera 😂 I had a bird join the call once

Toxoplasmosis cam

That’s AMAZING!

After seeing bad parking posts all day I just encountered this guy by the Hub!

are we deadass 💔

This may be the most insane parking job i have ever encountered

this gotta be a doordasher there ain’t no way 😭

I'm trying to see what kind of reasoning they could possibly have for doing that but can't 😭 what was the thought process

I feel like you should get kicked out of college if you park like this. Clearly you cheated to get in. This is Low Iq move haha

nice parking bro

I don’t see a problem, they’re following the traffic laws and using the crosswalk to get to the other side! Great job to them!

Of course it’s a fucking Altima

I keep seeing ppl do this. A girl did this the other day and I had to go the long way to enter bc I am a wheelchair user. I can kind of understand it if ur there for a second and there is absolutely no parking but if that’s not the case ur just an ass. I hope my wheelchair dents and scrapes ur car.

Seeing all of the posts about parking on Fairfax campus I'm perfectly happy to never have to go there.

And they say there’s no danger in driving high

That mans is drunk or high. There’s no way they’ve lived long enough to think that’s a parking spot.

there is absolutely no way

Incredible job staying inside the lines

That’s amazing. Just be thankful this person was parked and not on the road with you.

Sending a message

Not the first time I've seen someone do that

I’m more concerned about the build of that monstrosity

I feel privileged to have witnessed this rare gem firsthand.

Only thing I can think of is if they are taking something on a cart to their trunk and need to get as close as possible/can't carry it over the curb

Maxima I think💔💔 edit: you might be right💔💔

I don't know how to drive but thanks for believing in me!

And you should be, I have never considered that someone could violate the ADA while in a car, without parking in a disabled spot.

What’s crazy is the backed into the spot so they knew they were doing it too😭

It's less of a lift/drop if they pulled up next to the curb, so still dumb.

YOU GUYS FUCKING GOT THIS Classes start in just 4 days, and I know we’re all feeling a bit anxious. But we’ve got this! It’s going to be a wild journey, so let’s promise not to give up. Approach this new semester with a positive mindset! And remember, stay on top of your work—procrastination will only make things harder! Let’s make it a great Fall semester! 🍂

Thank you for the encouragement, SigmaOhioGyattRizz!

For each fortnight, I prayed that a redditor named SigmaOhioGyattRizz would give me words of encouragement. Long behold, the brain rot gods have answered my cries of desperation. Thank you, SigmaOhioGyattRizz, for listening to my cries and answering them

this made my day … needed the positivity thank u kind soul

i love you SigmaOhioGyattRizz, please don’t die 🩵

This is so sweet, thank you lovely person!!;;; Sending support and success your way too <3

Thank you my tiktok brain friend 🥰

Your username lol

Thank you! Let's go!

Appreciate you my friend!

This made my day, thanks! ONE STEP AFTER ANOTHER...

Thanks for the encouragement! My class started last week (HAP 715 masters program) and whew it’s going to be a doozy!! Good luck and have a great semester!

Or maybe you don’t. Post secondary education isn’t for everyone. It doesn’t mean that there aren’t other opportunities out there. Give it the good ole college try but know when to cut your losses before you’re tens of thousands of dollars in debt

you don't need to use the f word it's worse than you may think

I thought you were being silly with the name... then I had to check for myself LMFAO

You have quite the creativity

You aint just corny you the whole damn cob boy

You must be an incoming freshman…

Alright, when we kissing since you wanna correct me so bad?

Update on my TA crush So I finally mustered the courage to confess after class ended, thanks to a couple of my friends convincing me. I mentioned how we’re both graduating this semester, and suggested that we could get to know each other after the semester ends. Yeah, it didn’t work out lol. She was really nice about it though. It is what it is I guess. Don’t confess to your TA guys —no matter how much you like them.

This guy single handedly kept the sub alive this semester lol.

At least bro was brave enough to confess 💀💀 gotta give him that

Please drop a part 2 vid of you throwing another bouquet of flowers 💐

If you never confessed you’d always wonder how it would’ve ended up if you did. Now you know and can move on

Nah man, you did something a lot of people can't do. Seriously, a lot of dating is shooting your shot. You won't get most of them but you'll find people into you.

My wife asked me out right after our class was done and I was the TA. I said yes so don’t take this as an absolute case.

😂😂😭😭😭 im sorta in the same situation & yeah hell naw im taking this as a sign to not shoot my shot

I disagree about not confessing, you at least have an answer on whether or not you had a chance. Now you can put that focus and energy elsewhere.

She might have known about these reddit posts and was creeped out 💀

You miss 100% of the shots you don’t take bro

shooters shoot my boy

Business major activities 🙄

omg youre literally so brave LOL

GG bro, at least you confess

Hanging in there fam. You mustered up and found courage! Happy for you for getting out of your comfort zone.

Always take a chance! I dated my Physics TA in Sophomore year. Physics 101, always showed up for the after hours and one time it was just us. Proud of you soldier, good luck!

Hey at least you tried better to try than have no regrets. Now you can move on and try to find someone else sorry it didn't work out.

If it makes you feel better, GMU has been cracking down on inappropriate relationships in the training as of late. It may not be the reason, but all in all... it may be better for you.

It is kind of taking advantage of them to pursue a TA. They are trying to help you and be nice. Just not the right thing to do in return.

Damn bro its ok you will get back up. Head up king.

I’ll go on in your memory bro.

![gif](giphy|v01vVloDJbXrZRvEI8|downsized)

I’m Rick James bittchhhh

I’m gonna miss you bro

word of advice play it cool next time walk up and be like i was thinking about shooting my shot but i was saving those for your back, my names, how u doin, works every time hasnt been patched yet, goodluck soldier 🫡

Ask her out once you get that bred up, the tables will surely turn

guy is carrying loll

will you be my gf 😈

Really? That’s awesome. Good luck Dr. 😉

Thanks for your answer Mr.YaoiGay, I'm sure the president of the Wow Wow Wubzy fan club is going to enjoy your thought out response.

Well you’re in luck! Hmu!

I’m also in finance. I’m a bankteller.

Gets me every time

Professor I need serotonin

This just happened to me this morning....

If you read the syllabus you would know we are not using that this semester

Thanks to corona

Do you fart?

Jokes on GMU. I don't even own a webcam.

We still on break right?

If we learned anything we wouldn’t be there - cause we’d learn what a scam universities are outside of STEM fields

My perspective is that you learn how to learn. This is especially true for engineers and I hear veterans say it all the time. Graduate level it gets even worse, for lack of a better term. Only class I really picture that you need closer feedback are language classes, but a lot of technology these days can erode that requirement. Also, I really do prefer labs in person. Simulation is not the same. I digress.

Im in my last semester of EE and can confirm you need a degree to do EE jobs as some of the material is so obscure and specific you wouldn’t know about it unless you took a course in it

The purpose of universities isn’t teaching, but *credentialing*. A diploma is proof that the university has tested you on the subject matter of a field and believes that you understand it. How well? See GPA, and grades in individual classes. And universities *themselves* are evaluated to ensure that those decisions are trustworthy. [ABET accreditation](https://www.abet.org/accreditation/) is the process by which a university established an educational program that meets certain quality standards - as opposed to, say, a diploma mill that is prepared to give anybody a degree without proper testing. Note that all of these objectives could be met without actually teaching anything. Lots of certificate programs exist that *only* perform testing, based on knowledge that test-takers are expected to acquire on their own. And many professions require both. Doctors must graduate from an accredited medical school *and* pass board exams. Lawyers must graduate from accredited law schools *and* pass a bar exam. Etc.

I mean I think medicine counts as Science, Tech you’re right and you can usually get a cert for, Engineering you definitely need a degree to get a job and Math (accounting) I’d say you probably need a degree for. Law as well for sure. Most of Humanities are pointless though - and I’m a psych major.

Programming is only a very small percentage of computer science

I would say you can teach a lot of the aspects of medicine to yourself. Accounting I could definitely imagine teaching yourself, not so similar to a math class. Law requires feedback. I think that makes it difficult to learn by yourself since interpretation can have many folds.

Cs isn't just programming though

There are accounting certs out there, but having a degree is useful for the higher paying accounting jobs according to an accounting friend i have

I agree with this. I know people who do accounting that never got a degree, but as they inched their way higher up, the requirements increasingly become mandatory. This can be applied to other fields too. Not everyone in the medical field, for example, is a doctor. There are orderlies, technicians, scribes, etc., many of whom do not have a degree.

Exams hit this poor soul so hard... I was just walking through this section of the library, trying to get to a study room, when I saw this poor guy completely knocked out on the floor. I was so worried I had to stop for a second to make sure he was still breathing.

so college coded

This my buddy, he’s totally fine, was just on 250mg of fentanyl that’s it

Same buddy, same

I missed my college days, you won’t have such experience anymore once you’re out of school, enjoy it 😁

kid’s got great shoelaces though

Are the GMU libraries open at midnight?

My God same carpet, corrals and brick walls

I saw this too, poor guy! 😭

I like the red-blue shoelaces and jeans- shirt ensemble.

I'm confused as to how there was just someone casually sitting next to him doing their work? Were they friends?

I pray to GOD I never have to be like this

Thank you for checking on him, that was very kind of you! And yes, we are friends! He just needed a quiet place to rest after his class and I was already at the library doing homework

Gotta hit the fent lean before midterms

No, the library section closes at midnight on Sundays to Thursdays. But the lobby stays open until 3 am.

Met the Celebrity 🤩 Saw him peeki

I’m an alumni but I clearly need to visit the campus. Where can I get an autograph?

i wonder what he’s majoring in

that might just be George Mason himself reincarnated as a fox

What does the fox say?

sweet fellow

His name is Petey

i see him every other week lol

hes so cute

Communication probably. Can’t wait to hear him speak

“Southside food sucks”

Society if group projects didn't exist.

If I had a dollar everytime I went to a teacher/professor and said my group hasn't done shit. I'd have like 8 dollars

It's the first couple weeks no one does anything or says anything because we don't want to be the one who does all the work in the group for me. If you're gonna make us do group projects, you should let us do anonymous grading for each member.

Society if standardized testing didn’t exist

Easily the worst part of my college experience. It was always just one or two people in the group doing 95% of the work. I had so many late nights hobbling together a group project because one or more members didn't do anything or it was so terrible they may as well done nothing. There were so many terrible excuses too. I get that people have other things going on like work and family, but you chose to sign up for the class.

Group projects when your class is completely online <<<<<

Hmmm idk how I feel about group projects tbh. I always volunteer to make the presentation and make it look really pretty lol

I hate to tell you, but society is essentially a group project. The Trump Administration is an illustration that sometimes the idiots lead the group and the rest of us have to just watch our grade go to shit.

Yup, I’m the guy who somehow gets into the groups with the nicest most hardworking people so I feel bad when I only contribute way less than the group leader does.

Bad news, even in graduate school it's like that lmao

Sad reality, family household income is correlated with SAT score.

Omg ISOM. Yes. I feel that

You're the guy that carries the group lmao. Good man!

Insert Nancy Pelosi clapping meme here. You nailed it. Clap clap clap.

As to be expected

Even colleges are making it optional now. Back then they removed the essay portion and now they’re definitely gonna get rid of it entirely. And now with covid going on, I don’t think many students will be taking it.

Haha im not too sure about that! I think doing the research beforehand is quite a heavy task as well! Shoutout to those people as well :)

Yep. I'm a senior applying to GMU and during an online meeting, they said it won't matter if you don't send your SAT score this year.

When will you learn

Ya know, they may have wanted to get GMU to be less of a commuter school... but they have now taken the commute out of school entirely

That your actions have consequences?

can i have an award

Tell that to all the on-campus kids.

Yup....even though they try their hardest to try to have the image of a more traditional school

This has 123 upvotes...

I truly feel like I don’t belong here as a person who doesn’t have a car— let alone a driver’s license

“I HATE THE SONIC FANBASE”

Have all classes gone to online yet btw?? I’ve seen a lot of people’s have moved. I haven’t been able to check mine yet because my password apparently was changed and I just haven’t gotten around to getting it fixed cus that system is a little annoying.

YOU FRICKIN FRICKS!!

They may as well. A handful have been "under construction" for the last 3 years

Ask and ye shall receive

I can't because they're all staying at home now

Why would you get a car before a driver's license?

S/O to SammyClassicSonicFan who is now grown up and is ACTUALLY kinda cute.

Haha true! What I meant was, I lived on campus at Mason, was super involved and had a good social life (yes lots of parties too). I honestly never saw Mason as a commuter school but mostly due to my own experiences. It’s really what you make of it. If you live at home, go on campus just for your classes and come back, it will 100% seem like your average “commuter school”.

I think they meant to write "who doesn't have a driver's license- let alone a car".

i mean i got my car and i still don't have a license lmao my dad just kinda came home one day and was like "yeah so here your car" lmao

Geese babies came to say hello Parents were not pleased 🤣

Such cuties 🥰 parents ready to F you up 🤣🤣

The way the one on the right has his neck I just know it was hissing at you 😂

I see them when I’m walking from Lot K in the mornings. Always makes me smile.

I love them so much. They are so cute!

Adios... it's been real In fall 2012, I started at GMU as a 38-year-old, part-time student with aspirations of studying electrical engineering. I enrolled in one class - and dropped it after two weeks. (During our first meeting, my academic advisor said: "Oh, you have a master's in computer science? You can start in the EE track wherever you want!" ... which turned out to be absurdly wrong. I picked ECE 220, which has a prerequisite of ECE 201, which of course I hadn't taken. I was instantly in over my head. Not a great start.) I started again in spring 2013 the *right* way - taking ECE 201, and also Math 114 (Calculus II). (Academic advisor: "You already have credit for Calculus II, why take it again?" Answer: Because I took it *20 years ago* and didn't do well, and I think I need to *actually know* this stuff this time.) Much better start. My first few years, I completed five classes per year (two fall/spring, one summer). Over time, the difficulty of the material increased; my career picked up steam; my family required more attention; and I ran out of summer classes that I could take for meaningful credit. My course load dropped to two classes a year, which was productive but painfully slow. I chipped away at a BSEE degree for *eight years*. This afternoon, I took my last final exam. I'm done. (I was admitted to the BSEE / MSEE program and completed some 500- and 600-level classes, but ultimately decided not to continue. I will still be learning - but plan to spend 2021 deep-diving into machine learning, including professional certifications.) A few memories: * I experienced both wonderful and terrible instructors. I met both talented and unmotivated classmates. I think that I learned something from all of them. Along the way, I developed friends in my classes, but all too briefly; they all cruised past me and graduated while I continued to plug away slowly. * I stressed about my grades, sometimes pretty seriously. I dropped classes when I could have muddled through and passed with B/C, simply because it was more important to me to *learn the actual material* than to get through it quickly. If I'd known how long and how strenuous the program would be, I wouldn't have started - but I'm glad I didn't, because I'm glad I did. Electrical engineering is a hell of a great topic. * I spent far too much time and money in the Northern Neck Starbucks. For the rest of my life, I will cherish the idea of a local 24/7 cafe. * After spending about five years choking down substandard and overpriced food from the (old) JC food court, I discovered Ike's, and then spent a bunch of late nights there with a textbook. * I served on the Honor Committee and tried my absolute best to be fair to students, as did all of the other committee members I met. (Want to avoid an honor code charge in CS classes? *Do your own work* and don't even look at Stack or Chegg in the context of your assignments. I cannot stress this enough: it's really that simple.) * I participated in SRCT - a wonderful organization - and donated a project (GMUCal) to help students create calendar entries for their classes. * I had a terrible experience with one of the lower-level ECE labs - only because the lab manual was, like, 15 pages *total* and a complete waste of time. ("Build this circuit. Measure that voltage. The End.") It was tragic because the class covered great material, but the lab was trivial and boring. I ended up writing a new lab manual for the class... which, hopefully, makes it a worthwhile experience. * Our senior design project was a student-led effort to create an infrared laser pointer to control a computing environment. I enjoyed functioning as part of a skilled engineering team - we had our ups and downs, and we put *way* too much time and money into it, but we succeeded and learned a lot. Easily the best experience of the ECE program. * Finishing the program with a year of COVID and distance learning has been disappointing, but... ultimately, not *that* different. The material is the same; the assignments and labs and projects and exams are the same; lectures are still 85 minutes long. I *loved* being able to watch the lectures on my own time, and the ability to pause and reverse and replay bits when needed. But I get that this model doesn't work for some people, and I missed the feeling of camaraderie with classmates. A word of advice: I don't think that GMU, or universities in general, will ever be "normal" in the pre-2020 sense again - distance learning is here to stay. Accepting it and learning to excel in that model will help you a great deal. In total, GMU has been a great experience. I hope that everyone sets and achieves high academic goals and uses their academic training to advance the world, in whatever ways you can and want. Good luck to you all, Patriots. See you around.

Are you me? Jeez, that's my exact story, except I'm 36, not 38.

Congratulations. I’m happy for you. I think this post and others similar goes to show how people’s experiences at Mason don’t foreshadow others. They are good and bad qualities of any school. I think it’s all about how you spend your time and being able to realize that no matter what major you may be you may down the line do something entirely different or something similar. I graduate next semester and I am still thinking about what I want to do. I know how important it is to have something lined up but it’s also good to have periods where I allow myself to take in a semester or experience. I’m always interested in hearing from others at Mason and their experiences. Thank you :)

Congratulations! It's so encouraging to hear about other people overcoming difficulties that all of us most likely face. I may be younger than you, but considering myself a sort of very untraditional student, I am happy for you.

As a fellow non- trad student with a job and family going part time, this is what I needed to hear. My degree program is taking forever. Your resilience is inspiring :) Many congrats.

Congratulations! You are an inspiration, and I mean that in complete sincerity. I've recently started back (at NoVa, with the intent to transfer into GMU in a couple of semesters) in Mech E, at 50 years old. Calc II was 31 years ago for me. If someone held a gun to my head and told me to differentiate something I would just reach over and pull the trigger for them. I've considered taking the classes again, but am trying Khan Academy to see if I can figure it out. The math courses terrify me a bit - and I got A's in Calc I/II back when it was still being taught by Newton (or maybe on a Newton). I just finished my first finals in almost 30 years - and I've aced my classes, but the idea of Dif Eq is lurking out there like a shark in dark waters.

You’re a legend. Keep it up bro, I graduate with a bachelors in cyber security engineering in the next 8 days and I can never feel so psyched about it. Finally done, after some struggles, we all hustle our way through. Congratulations

An incredible feat! This post gives me tremendous joy. Congratulations on your determination and drive. I wish you all the very best for your future!

As a current applicant (different program) these are the stories I love to hear about universities. I hope I get admitted!

It was great interacting with you in SRCT. I'm glad to hear that you made it through. GMU is really an experience that is hard to sum up, but you've certainly done an admirable job. I wish you much success in your next adventure!

Chiming in here, I'm 35 and got my Bachelors in CS. Transferred from Nova in 2015. Thank you for articulating this and congrats!

What certs are you planning to get?

LETS GOOOOO

I wonder if there are any other non-traditional CS students here.

Congratulations!!! Hard work pays off :) excited to be where you are one day!!

I’m 59 and still working on my B.S. in public administration. Lots of starts and stops. Love every minute of it!

Congrats! I came back to school at 23 after a stint in the military; now 2 semesters away from a BS in Math and minor in CS.. going for that MSCS next!

Hello - I dm'd you.

Spain with s silent

Champagne but the Cham is silent

Students expected to put in 2x the amount of effort to learn meanwhile all professors have to do is send out a weekly announcement 🤡 🤡

Happiness but you remove the 'hap' and the 'ess' and put an a after the p

Professors have to work even harder just so you can have a seamless online experience. It is much harder to teach students online than in-person. Must of this work is abstracted away so you can have a better online experience. Of course, why should they even try if they get ungrateful responses like this.

I think the complaint is that professors are not teaching. I have a weekly class on Zoom and my professor puts us in breakout groups and lets us talk about the class together for 2 hours with literally zero direction. She tells us to just discuss upcoming assignments and projects. I’m paying over $2000 for this class and am being taught nothing whatsoever. Maybe you are fortunate enough to have better professors, but stop making excuses for shitty professors. I am not having a seamless online experience. This is a dumpster fire.

Almost all of my professors expect us to write more and not grade our assignments. Lectures were fine in the beginning now they just tell us to do the reading 😂 and I am here wondering why I am wasting 50,000$ per year on their salaries

How is that though? From my experience all they say is read text book chapter xx and do the online assignment

Yeah I'm sure there are some great professors out there that are trying but it feels like the majority of them are getting all their grading done through online hw systems, exams and tests are being graded by blackboard, PowerPoints were made 10 years ago, like honestly what are these professors being paid for? Online learning has made it easier for professors and much harder for students. Not saying they should make everything P/F but at least *try* to take some of the load off the students.

Have you talked to the professors that you consider to be shitty? I’m genuinely curious. I have. That’s where I got my information from. As I said, much of what they do is abstracted away. Now, ofc there are ones that don’t care. Those professors probably do bad in-person as well. They shouldn’t be professors. But, at least from my experience this semester and last semester, they were actually trying, not sleeping at nights trying to convert their courses, putting in massive effort trying to teach the students online, creating brand new assignments, etc.

Not to be that person lol but a lot of professors have to apply to grants to fund their own salaries. Tuition seems to go to other bs but I understand the frustration of paying so much to feel like it's going to waste

> online hw systems They're called TAs and they're human beings. Underpaid human beings. Have some respect. /s

As I said, much of what they do is abstracted away. They won’t tell you about the many nights they didn’t get sleep trying to convert their courses to be online. They won’t tell you about the many hours they’re spending making new assignments that they can’t re-use since they taught in-person. Have you talked to your professors? Have you asked them exactly how much they’re doing? I have. That’s how I know. Online learning is hard. Many of them don’t realize that these online alternatives are actually more stressful to the students than the in-person ones. It’s hard to know how the students feel and how long they take on these new assignments that they just created this one semester. So talk to them! We’re just all trying to get by in these weird times.

💀💀😩😭 The red grade mark is forever engrained into my head.

That’s how all of my Final Exam grades are gonna be looking like in a week

Blackboard is so shit we need to use canvas

Just watching this gives me anxiety

What my calculus exam will be like in a couple of days:

I SCREAMED TOOO OMFG

F in the chat

My controls prof hasn't posted our exam 2 grade from October and our final is on Monday

I once was already failing a Calc class and my parents still demanded I go to the final because “it’s the principle of the thing”, missed Green Day at a club in DC for $30, got like 40%, and transferred majors

Me in physics tomorrow

This why I drop classes halfway

Your grades are honestly so relatable to mine this semester! Hopefully it won't fuck up your GPA!

Is a 115 out of 200 good?

my condolences

Aiming for that for both my finals. Pray for me, I don't want to study

I'm so sorry man ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|grimacing)

The way my stomach dropped…

Canvas is way better

Did my undergrad at University of Nebraska, we got rid of Blackboard and moved to Canvas in 2016 cuz it was hilariously archaic and bad, was stunned to see GMU still using Blackboard when I came here for grad school.

Blackboard is fine. I don't know why people are complaining about it; there are no issues with Blackboard.

You do know you have to teach yourself right like there's no substitute for ignoring the teacher and putting the work in yourself.

Yeah definitely. Only the luckiest few of us can achieve that sweet 57.5%

Depends, are you a glass half empty or glass half full kind of guy?

People like Canvas more, but they are still less likely to do assignments and readings posted to it, so it also kind of sucks (and it requires the professor set it up just right or else things aren't available to students in the ways that students usually use it. It's a mess.)

You gotta use canvas to know

Found the professor 👀

My favorite movie is Inception.

I can taste the sarcasm

Half full I think

No dude I'm just older, most cut throat, and wiser. Most College professors are there to act as figureheads and at best facilitate an environment. Very few actually mentor and teach. The larger your class the lower the quality of your education.

You jest but I somehow got curved from a 52 to a 79 in my PHYS class. I ain't complainin' tho.

Well either way it's an F RIP

That doesn’t really excuse a shitty teacher. Being “older” and “cut-throat” doesn’t really excuse your poorly worded statement either. I graduated at 30 yo— I’m not exactly a young spry. I’m not sure what your major was but my department was extremely helpful and were actually interested in mentoring the next generation of professionals. I always went to their office hours not just to discuss homework but also career paths. I can still message my advisor and former professors and get a response after graduating years ago. Sorry your department gave you a bad experience, but not all of them are like yours.

The majority of people who think older people are inherently more cut throat and wiser are usually the exception

Molecular Biology. It's f****** cut throat there. I had to change schools for my undergrad cuz I hated it so much. The program i finally matriculated from only had nine people in my major. Granted it cost $50,000 a year but it was worth it. A lot of large universities hire researchers and expect them to be able to teach and one has nothing to do with the other. Things have accomplished since being a lowly undergrad include having my own company and conducting my own research.

That would be the fallacy of youth.

/r/iamverysmart I'm not even that young, I've been graduated for 3+years

You know if you wanted to prove you are a cunt there are easier ways. And I've been out for decades.

>I am wise >No you are not >Ok cunt Ah yes, oh great sage

GMU Police Officers Sue GMU for Police Corruption There was a press release given on Friday where GMU Police Officers are suing GMU for a culture of police corruption. It says that GMU officers tried to report wrongdoing, but instead of a proper investigation, the reporting officers got punished. Link to PDF here: [http://www.fairfaxunderground.com/forum/file.php?2,file=449099,filename=PRESS\_RELEASE\_-\_03.26.2021.pdf](http://www.fairfaxunderground.com/forum/file.php?2,file=449099,filename=PRESS_RELEASE_-_03.26.2021.pdf) Full text below: March 26, 2021 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Media Contact: J. Caleb Jones, Esq. 703-771-4671 jcjones@simmsshowerslaw.com GMU OFFICERS FILE COMPLAINT ALLEGING PATTERN AND PRACTICE OF POLICE CORRUPTION AT GMU, SEEKING $5,620,000 Case No. 2021-03914 On March 15, 2021, two George Mason University (GMU) police officers filed a suit in Fairfax Circuit Court alleging a pattern and practice of police corruption at GMU. The officers’ complaint alleges retaliation for reporting a use of excessive force by a GMU police officer against a handcuffed arrestee, who was taken into custody for a non-violent offense on January 28, 2018, at the EagleBank Arena on the Fairfax GMU campus. In addition to the excessive force, the two officers noted their suspicion that the official written police report of the incident contained deliberately fabricated facts, designed to place blame on the arrestee for the force used and cover up the actions of the officer by describing violence of the arrestee against officers, which the body-worn camera video does not corroborate. Counsel for the officers has been able to contact the arrestee, who has confirmed in a sworn affidavit that the facts in the police report describing his attempts to “kick, bite, and strike officers” are not true, even during the short moments when the officer’s body-worn camera does not directly capture the arrestee and the officer. The use of excessive force was captured on the body-worn camera of an officer at a time when the body-worn camera system was first being introduced at GMU. As such, most GMU police officers did not know that their actions were regularly being recorded. As a result of the plaintiffs’ attempts to have these allegations of excessive force and false police report properly investigated, GMU has removed the plaintiffs from job duties, demoted or transferred them, and even defamed an officer before the Fairfax County Commonwealth’s Attorney, claiming that he was found to be guilty of dishonesty in his role at the department. The officers’ complaint alleges that multiple departments and senior administrators at GMU, up to and including the Office of the President, participated in the cover-up, punishment, and retaliation of the two officers who reported this matter in good faith. Sworn testimony already taken from some defendants supports many of these claims. In contrast to the treatment of the reporting officers, the officer who was allegedly recorded using excessive force has since been promoted twice; this officer now holds a significant supervisory position in the department. At the time of the incident in the video, presently known information seems to suggest this officer reported directly to the GMU Chief of Police. He now directly reports to one of the co-defendants involved in the retaliation of the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs have attempted to correct these wrongful actions through ordinary channels, to no avail. One plaintiff was not able to successfully challenge his discipline through the Virginia State Office of Equal Employment and Dispute Resolution (EEDR). In his matter, the hearing officer did not allow the video of the incident to be included as evidence. The other plaintiff was able to successfully challenge his discipline before the EEDR on the same set of facts. In his matter, the hearing officer did allow the video of the incident to be included as evidence. Despite limited relief – receiving an order from a state official for GMU to return the officer’s previous job duties to him – GMU has refused to return this officer to his previous position. Due to the impossibility of finding relief through ordinary internal channels, the officers have filed a complaint in the Circuit Court of Fairfax County, through their attorneys at Simms Showers, LLP, in Leesburg, Virginia. Their complaint seeks to enforce the order of the hearing officer of the EEDR, and seeks equitable relief and monetary damages for whistleblower retaliation, conspiracy to obstruct justice, defamation, conspiracy to defame, fraud, conspiracy to defraud, and breach of contract. Plaintiffs have alleged total damages of $5,620,000. Because GMU has strenuously fought against both a proper investigation of this matter, and strenuously fought to keep the undisputed facts from public view, the plaintiffs, through their counsel, deliver this press release so that both this matter and the continuing pattern of police corruption at GMU receive the appropriate light of public scrutiny.

Why am I not surprised?

I had to deal with the gmu police back in 2016. Fuck them.

Wow! Look! It’s the “good cops” everyone keeps asking me to consider, hindered by a broken system that’s designed to prevent accountability! It’s almost like, how should I put this...a few good apples doesn’t redeem the bunch? Or maybe that a few bad apples have spoiled the bunch to the point where the “justice” coming out of this lawsuit is making amends for the cops that got punished for speaking out to the tune of millions of dollars. They’re maybe getting comped for committing career suicide and speaking out. That’s not exactly promoting accountability so much as throwing them hush money so they can stop being a problem.

Hi, I'm the attorney representing the two police officer plaintiffs. I will do my best to answer questions anyone has about this matter, while protecting my clients and our litigation strategy. I'll answer a few issues that have come up in this thread:

5.6 MILLION for the officers?!? That’s an outrageous amount of money even if they expect the university to settle! Nothing for the actual “arrestee” brutalized.

ACAB am I right guys?

FUCK THE COPS 🤡🐷

I'm not even surprised. I dealt with the GMU police one time in 2017 and it was awful. Pounded on my door at 1am the night before finals saying the RA had smelled weed from our room. They insisted on rifling through my prescriptions and would not leave even when it became very apparent there was no smell and we had nothing in our room. They actually seemed pretty pissed off that we hadn't done anything wrong. We even sent an email to the head of the GMU PD and he responded saying we had been acting "suspicious" and their actions were justified. How do you expect a 19 year old to act when cops pound on your door at 1 am??

If you look at the personnel roster you’ll see more command staff (lieutenants and captains) than patrol officers. That’s a clue.

How do we know let’s say the officers claiming corruption haven’t done corrupt stuff themselves in the past? Not implying or saying they did it but do we really just automatically assume they’re perfect angels because they blew the whistle first? What will the counter defense likely be for the accused of corruption? Just a question people no need to get offended or downvote it’s interesting to think about.

To the individuals who anonymously call my firm and encourage us to keep investigating GMU because of the poor environment on campus, thank you for your calls. Don't worry. We are, and no, we have no plans to stop. Though "settlement" can always be an outcome of a litigation, we have zero plans to just roll over in our settlement. Additionally, we are not merely investigating this single incident of police misconduct. We are particularly concerned about the strange University Life policies that outlaws gatherings of more than 10 people "whether planned or spontaneous." This policy is quite puzzling, and I am interested in it. I am particularly interested about whether it was a policy that was "on the books," at GMU, yet never enforced, or whether it was a policy with serious (and biased) enforcement. In the meantime, make the most of your time at Mason (despite the trouble). Make friends. Take your classes. Do well. Realize you're there to learn. Don't do drugs. And if you think that you've been the victim of an illegal action by GMU, I'm sure there's a good looking attorney somewhere in Leesburg Virginia who may be able to help.

???? what about the arrestee that was harmed? wtf is this shite.

I mean good for those officers for basically committing career suicide and exposing corruption but as others have said, what about the victims of the brutality? Are these officers in good conscience knowing they are essentially making money off of their colleagues’ brutality?

Unfortunately, may be unpopular but when you think about it is human nature for corruption to take place. There’s false reports and corruption in every field. It’s going to be hard to prove anything here against the cops in court. But I agree with your point it looks bad and I think the cops were wrong for the corruption and unethical. But it’ll never really go away. At least we have cops , although they may be corrupt it is better than corrupt anarchy with no cops at all.

Isn’t 5,620,000 a bit of a ridiculous number? Maybe 20,000 max is reasonable.

From my understanding, this is just the tip of the iceberg from the GMU police. Good for these officers for trying to make things better.

Where can we see the video?

Koch Brothers University supports police impunity and will lie to protect bad cops, no different than almost any other school, city, county, or state in this country. In other news, water is wet. This is what ACAB means. Even in a more "diverse," "progressive" place (GMU is conservative for a university, but relative to 90% of the outside world we're far left), good cops are forced to protect bad ones or get pushed out. These officers tried to "reform from the inside," and the inevitable result is that they're now on the outside and nothing changed. How much do you wanna bet GMU will just pay the verdict, raise the price of something on campus to make us pay for it, and keep the police as-is? But you can't have a BLM, fist, or ACAB mask at school-related functions because it's a political statement. Well, so is running the entire fucking Mercatus Center.

How do we automatically know they’re good apples? Just cause they blew the whistle first on their coworkers? I’m sure they’re all nice normal people in an unfortunate situation in an unfortunate work environment by the sound of it.

**Police Corruption Allegations** \- It should be noted that what we are challenging here is the GMU PD's failure to properly investigate a good-faith allegation of wrongful conduct, which could encompass a felony (deliberate falsification of a public record). However, the issues are complex. The officer whose name was on the report was making his first arrest of his career. That officer actually complained to his superior about the excessive force at the time, and that complaint went nowhere (paragraph 98 of the Complaint). That report was required to be approved by his supervisor to a greater extent than a normal officer, and for these reasons, we do not know who actually wrote these false statements, which is why we are not releasing the names of the other officers in question. We do not know if pressure was placed on the officer, if another superior officer added the false statements under his name, or if this officer incorrectly took the word of other officers and recorded them as his own observations, which allowed the other GMU PD officers and administrators to take advantage of a genuine mistake. It's all in play, and we really don't know what's going on. Only through discovery and depositions will we (possibly) find out.

**What now?** \- This is a big problem and the solution is not going to be easy. There is a big problem of corruption at GMU, and it is a danger to GMU officers, GMU students, and the public at large. (Trust me. I know. This is not my only case involving GMU.) The only way this is going to get better is if EVERYONE (GMU administrators, GMU Police, and GMU Students) starts to act in the way they SHOULD act. So start doing that now, at every moment of every day, including how you react to reading this stuff. That's going to be very hard to know how to do that, but it is like the good book says: >"Check it out: I am sending you out as sheep in the midst of wolves, so be wise as serpents and innocent as doves. (Matthew 10:16, modified by my own translation)" It is very difficult when someone is "in the midst of wolves" to be "wise as serpents and innocent as doves," and no one is perfect. That's why I feel for my "defendant" clients just as much as I do for my "plaintiff" clients. Also, it is worth remembering that "fighting wolves" doesn't make you "innocent as doves." Just because your reaction can be described as "protest" doesn't mean that you are in the right, even if the person or organization you are protesting is in the wrong. Wolves fight wolves, too, you know. The only bit of advice I can give that will apply to everyone is this: Tell the truth. Don't exaggerate. Don't pass off your "interpretation" or "speculation" as "observation." Don't gossip, and for goodness sake, NEVER LIE. Ordinary people make mistakes, but only wolves lie. So never lie. The amount of lies I have seen from GMU is the reason that this is happening. And as the good book also says: >The end of all things is at hand; therefore be self-controlled and sober-minded for the sake of your prayers. Above all, keep loving one another earnestly, since love covers a multitude of sins. (1 Peter 4:7-8) And if you ever find yourself in a pickle, or need help due to the wrongdoing of others, the good book ALSO says: >Do your best to speed \[J. Caleb Jones\] the lawyer and \[Simms Showers, LLP\] on their way; see that they lack nothing. (Titus 3:13, modified by my own interpretation) Perhaps an extremely good looking lawyer would be willing to help you.

**Career Suicide**? This may be career suicide, but hopefully not. With the present administration and command staff, it certainly is. However, based on my representation of several GMU police officers (some of whom GMU does not even know about yet), it was determined that "career suicide" is a more honorable end than being the victim of "career homicide."

**The Real Problem Here** \- This situation that the officers reported was bad, but the real problem here is what happened afterwards. I represent many officers in many different jurisdictions and situations. When life gets too crazy for ordinary citizens, they call "the police." That's why being an officer is tough. At the end of the day, officers are ordinary people. Some are absolutely amazing. Most are pretty good. Some are quite average. A few are downright malicious. In other words, they are ordinary people. When ordinary people mess up in their jobs -- whether they be doctors or lawyer or finance workers or construction workers or police officers -- the best thing is for that mistake to be appropriately identified, documented, and corrected, and for the one who messed up to be appropriately chastised (either in public or private depending on the magnitude of the offense), and get the remediation and training they need so that it doesn't happen again. That's what should have happened. But it didn't. Instead, what we've found is a culture at GMU that circles the wagons, protects those who do wrong, and punishes those who seek appropriate correction. THAT is the real problem here, and THAT is why we have taken the extraordinary step of going public with this complaint and press release.

**Defamation** \- This was one of the most shocking actions for me personally. Plaintiff 2 was the one who reported the wrongdoing up the chain of command and was demoted as a result of his actions. He was the one who did not receive relief from the EEDR process, in large part (in my opinion) because the video of the wrongdoing was not allowed to be introduced as evidence in the hearing. Despite failing to get relief and despite his punishment being left in place, about 6 months after the conclusion of the matter, the GMU PD gave him notice that he was placed on the "Brady List" at Fairfax County PD. This is an informal list of officers created due to a series of Supreme Court cases, in which their pattern of dishonesty creates exculpatory evidence of criminal defendants. It truly is a black mark on his career for all time if the matter is not corrected. It is an extremely big deal and one of the biggest vindictive acts of fear imposed by the GMU PD in this entire dirty episode.

**Damages**. The number of $5.6 million is actually quite complicated. There are two plaintiffs, six defendants (GMU is one, the rest are GMU employees and administrators, and one is a "John Doe," due to our suspicion that more bad actors will be found and added to the complaint later.) When drafting a complaint, if you don't ask for it, you simply won't get it. This number should not be seen as the money the plaintiffs are attempting to "grab." Instead, it is a complex number that factors in punitive damages (which are designed to punish a wrongdoer, but are capped at $350,000 by state law), compensatory damages (paying the plaintiffs back for what has been taken from them), equitable damages (turning a bad action into some sort of "this is the amount of money that we can fairly equate to that action to compensate you") and nominal damages (which is just almost just a place-holder to show that a wrong has been committed). It is possible that some claims will go forward and some will not, which requires putting a large number together, so that even if 4 claims are not proven, the bad acts of the one claim against the defendants can still fairly compensate them and punish the wrongdoers.

**Why not the Arrestee**? The arrestee has been contacted and is cooperative with our litigation. He has reviewed the police report and confirmed that it contains false statements about him. I cannot say anything beyond that, but just know that litigation is a huge drain on the clients, and it is not crazy for someone to wish to stay out of it. The issue is complicated.

**10 Year Anniversary of Wrongdoing** \- Believe it or not, one of the plaintiffs has been fighting a battle to get GMU PD in line for around 10 years. As the complaint explains: >Allegations were made against one of the two Captains, all four Lieutenants, four of the eight Sergeants, and two non-law enforcement employees. As a result of these complaints, an investigative auditor with the GMU began an investigation, in which \[plaintiff 1\] assisted. The auditor’s final report showed wide-spread violations of Virginia policy and law among the senior leadership command at the GMU Police Department. Such violations included the failure to record leave taken and the viewing, sharing, and storage of sexually explicit materials (totaling over 3,000 photographs and 80 messages requesting sexual favors), on state-issued computers while on state time. Additionally, there were confirmed allegations of racist and sexually explicit comments from command staff to other GMU employees, and theft of items in the GMU “lost and found.” As a result of the investigation, approximately seven or eight members of the GMU Police Department left the university. Although no allegations were made against the GMU PD chief at that time, the chief elected to resign from his position as a result of the report. > >After this investigation and exposure of the GMU Police Department, GMU retaliated against \[plaintiff 1\] by refusing to promote him according to his service and experience. Through a hearing before the Office of Employment Dispute Resolution in 2014, it was found that GMU wrongfully failed to promote \[plaintiff 1\] from Sergeant to Lieutenant and wrongfully moved him away from the main GMU campus of Fairfax to the Prince William County satellite campus in retaliation for reporting and participating in the investigator’s 2012 investigation. Though the original hearing decision ordered GMU to promote \[plaintiff 1\] to Lieutenant, an administrative appeal challenged the hearing officer’s authority to provide such relief. An administrative appeal decided on July 24, 2014 changed the order’s decision to the following language: > >For the reasons stated herein, the University is ORDERED: > >1) The University is ordered to create an environment for Grievant that is free from retaliation. This order shall remain in effect as long as Grievant is employed by the University. > >2) The University is ordered to provide Grievant with a remedy that accounts for and corrects its retaliation against him. > >The University took no action pursuant to this revised order. Though an order was sought from the circuit court to enforce the hearing decision, due to the finding of retaliation connected to his failure to be promoted, the circuit court determined the order was too vague to be enforced. As a consequence, GMU did nothing of any substance, and\[plaintiff 1\] remained in the Sergeant position. Though \[plaintiff 1\] was promoted eventually, it was through normal processes and not in relation to his successful grievance. In fact, his grievance was a weight on his professional advancement. Other officers without a history of reporting wrongdoing rose in the ranks of GMU PD faster than \[plaintiff 1\], despite his experience and training.

Well it's split two ways and their careers are basically over. 2.5 mil is a pretty standard amount to make over the course of a career. Thus by ruining and defaming the reporting officer's careers they have actually cost them a multiple million dollar sum of money. Factor in lawyer fees at 40-50% that number is fair imo

Isn’t it funny how other people commented this but got downvoted

Are the cops that reported the corruption bastards? Don't get me wrong, I have a strong distaste for police and have had my fair share of unpleasant encounters, but these generalizations are not helping anyone. Admittedly, Most Cops Are Bastards doesn't have the same ring to it.

OP Here. I suppose there's no way to prove that to you, but I'll give a good reason that it should be the case. This is a big case for me, and I wouldn't have done things this way if my clients weren't absolutely spotless. Nobody's perfect, but as far as I can tell, my clients are pretty darn close. The defense that I've encountered (so far) is that my clients are just a bunch of disgruntled employees who are making a big stink of things because they're mad that they got punished for "breaking policy" (read: the "policy" they "broke" was reporting the wrongdoing). What the real defense will be, I sure don't know, but we'll get an answer in 21 days.

I appreciate a good cup of coffee.

Is your entire point that we have to tolerate injustice simply because it's better than a societal breakdown? That doesn't have to be the dichotomy we're working with.

Ignore this guy he’s a freshmen he just joined this forum a few weeks ago

Where in the depths of ur ass did u get $20,000? That is not anywhere near reasonable for the consequences they faced for doing the right thing.

Their careers are basically over. Plus theyll have legal costs

Dude shut up gmu makes hundreds of millions every year. Just one student pays 20k to gmu for a year of schooling. Get the hell out of here you gmu suck up

Though we currently have a copy of the video (which is described in the complaint), unfortunately certain ethics rules and obligations prevent me from releasing a copy of the video that I have to the public. However, the video certainly exists. It is likely possible to FOIA the video from the University, but certain redactions for confidentiality will likely need to be applied. Additionally, if experience is any guide, it is my guess that they will wait until the last day to respond to the FOIA request, deny the request for a vague reason, pretending not to know precisely what video record you are asking for, ask you to apply again, claiming the record is confidential, etc., hoping that you will forget or give up in frustration.

Always have been

2006 called they want their anti Koch brothers political memes back. Even if they’re a thing who really cares. There’s probably other influencers than just Koch.

That was more or less my point. People like to say that there’s just “bad cops” and imply that most of them are fine or even good. So here’s the story of those “good cops” that everyone insists exists: they blew the whistle (a good thing) and so now they’re getting a cash-out instead of effecting real change. The system is just designed to resist any form of accountability, so it doesn’t matter if you have decent folks in it.

all apples rot, bruv.

With acab, the polic officers that reported the incidents will be forced out or silenced to where all that is left is bastard cops. Returning the ACAB balance

The Sign that opened my eyes! I guess Mason finally had enough of all the street preachers coming here over these past few weeks lol.

Some of the signs were already vandalized lol

Be aware that this policy can be used in a number of ways.

When im focusing on my engineering exam I don’t want to see a botched 1 in a million late term abortion. That is disruptive to my learning experience.

Sadly, they use the term facilities pretty intentionally. Outdoor campus grounds are considered public property and thus have allowances that may otherwise not be permitted within the facilities themselves, ie classrooms, libraries, residence buildings, theatre spaces, etc. So, with things like the gorey, "pro-lifers" and religious wackadoos walking around proselityzing there isn't much that can be done unless their actions tread into harassment. With that, I sent a report about the religious guys walking around when they approached me while I was sitting in my car. Can't do much as they harass every student trying to make it to class on time near Mason Pond, but it felt different having them walk up and knock on my window while I was eating lunch and trying to enjoy my short break.

Is this why I haven’t seen any of those guys lately? I was enjoying it…

I remember when once a year or two ago, the Muslim club was blasting quran in one corner, the Jewish club were blasting music from their Sukkah (I think that’s what the hut is called) in one corner, and a Christian preacher was yelling with a microphone in another corner, an Abrahamic triangle of sorts, it was an interesting experience to walk through the space in between them for sure

What is the point they are making, exactly? Who is this sign targeted at? From the url on the sign, it seems like its targeted at the students who are offended by the street preachers, if anything: "our efforts to build a civil and respectful environment cannot be used as reasons to limit the rights of others to express views that we may consider misguided or even offensive. [...] we must hold a fundamental commitment to "the principle that debate or deliberation may not be suppressed because the ideas put forth are thought by some or even by most members of the University community to be offensive, unwise, immoral, or wrong-headed." https://www.gmu.edu/about/integrity-and-standards/free-speech-george-mason

>Mason finally had enough of all the street preachers coming here over these past few weeks Mason's problem is that it can not suppress them. It is a public institution. The courts have repeatedly told public institutions of higher learning that they can not hide behind "fostering a learning environment" or words similar in order to suppress points of view with which much of the institution's community might not agree.

Doesn’t this restrict free speech? How does talking outside affect university operations?

I'm curious if they could have a similar effect by limiting it to students and alumni?

So, no free speech…

Gmu is try to teach to critical thinking, not some goon you fall for and be a bandwagon because it matches your belief. Whether you are belief of MLK, Charlie Kirk, Dave Chapelle, etc., dont encourage violence because you found someone with opposing views.

Snowflakes be snowflaking

Oh yeah because out of all the demonstrations out there the preachers are the biggest problem…

It doesn't align with their mission statement because they're demonic and anti-god. Liberals would ruin the United States if we would let them and remove God from every aspec of day to day life. Not on republicans watch cause in our houses we praise the lord. People have to have way more faith to believe the earth was created from a spark and just evolved into humans and animals perfectly designed to exist than it takes faith to believe a concious and great and powerful mind created us. You literally have way more faith in nothing creating nothing. Makes no sense.

Can you say that again for those in the back???

This but unironically

Keep reporting them for harassment, stalking, etc. I seriously would disregard GMU as a potential university to attend simply bc of those protesters. That kind of thing can ruin an entire college experience.

No, the sign is saying they're (and anyone else) is allowed to exercise free speech, but it must not be disruptive or unsanitary, and the University can enforce time and place restrictions on that free speech. I think.

Huh. I didn’t pick up on that at first.

posting enormous gore images can definitely dissuade students from going to class

They don't even go to school there or are you missing the point that they are highlighting that facilities should be used by students and faculty?

Yeah I’m dead serious

Almost every public college has this issue. You’ll be disregarding a lot of universities to attend if you’re drawing the line this high. Is it fucked? Absolutely. Are they weirdos? No doubt. But they’re everywhere. There’s nothing we can do.

Yeah, every college has this problem. It's not unique to George Mason

Undergrad @ FL Atlantic and Grad school @GMU both schools have the same kinds of people/orgs protesting and if you want to, you can circumvent them easily. GMU does a good job of supporting their students and not bowing down to Trump. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend anyone here and I hope you don't allow bad actors that are at most major universities to persuade you into not recommending GMU.

The protestors go to every major public university....you can't just make frivolous reports because you don't like certain 1st amendment activity.

I agree with you, but If you go to the URL on there it basically is defending the rights of those people. It literally says something along the lines of "even if the majority of people are offended, that is not a reason to put a stop to it" No idea why people seem to think this sign has anything to do with putting a stop to the gore/prostelyzers, probably all the fluffy wording of it.

Mason Fucked us All Over Prove Me Wrong No spring break, finals week is a week shorter, no reading days, online classes full cost. A few things to note, on the calendar it says we have a reading day, which is a Saturday, fucking bullshit. I am beyond upset and know so many students who feel as if they have been cheated by masons poor scheduling.

I have to agree with you. It's some bullshit. I have projects due after finals for some of my classes because of this. Utterly unfair.

Honestly this is my first semester here & I’m so exhausted.

Yeah but not much we can do except take this L with us and hope the fall semester is less abysmal

Speaking my language they suck our pockets dry and suck out our souls what else do they want But I think we should look at the bright side once we are done with it we’ll never have to look back and itll be an accomplishment

Be me, this semester of mechanical engineering is the one with the highest dropout rates, say “fuck it” and take a full courseload anyway The entire semester, not exaggerating, has been hell. Between the accelerated pace of important material and professors who didnt convert to online well (forcing me to teach myself outside of class attendance) i have barely scraped by. I have recorded every lecture since, in the schools genius, gave teachers the ability to block the download option on recorded lectures, so that i can re-study the entire semester over the summer Covid may be a great reason for professors to take some pity, but a mechanical device malfunctioning in my future potentially causing harm cant be explained away by “that lecture was online”

Yeah mason sucks. life sucks. its all just fucking awful.

I’m out of state (and online obvs) about to graduate. So I’ve got 2 projects and an essay for one class, two essays for another, an essay and a test for a third, and then my capstone project. One class is due Monday, one Tuesday, one Wednesday, and then the capstone Friday. But I’m flying back to FFX on Thursday, so I need to have everything finished by then. Do I have time to finish everything? If I don’t sleep sure.

Ironically this is my best semester. I guess cause I finally have a psychiatrist and therapist and on meds..:.. yeah not having break is terrible but honestly don’t really feel a difference to the reading days. Never even noticed we had reading days. We didn’t even get charged distance learning fees per class which I’m very grateful for. Working full time and usually taking online classes, those fees used to kill me. Plus didn’t have to buy a parking pass either. I also got a refund for Cares Act or whatever. Sorry you’re having a tough time, but try to find the positives of it.

I feel you but it is what it is at this point. Just Do best as you can. We are almost done with covid semester, fall 20 and spring 21, I don’t want to jinx it but I believe fall 21 will be better! All the best!

I would really consider postponing college if you are just getting started, work for a bit and save up until things get back to normal. It's not worth the money and extra stress if you can wait.

I'm.super pissed about all of that and some dude had the audacity to tell me that college is a privilege

Maybe they did but complaining isn’t going to fix it my friend you will do great on finals it will be okay

Yeah it sucks. All my finals are all within 1-3 days to each other

This semester is slight work just keep up and don't play Overwatch everyday LOLing. Got a 4.0 from just doing my work on time! Also we did get spring break it was an extension of winter break. [https://ibb.co/gdKpWGH](https://ibb.co/gdKpWGH)

Couldn’t agree more! I can’t believe I payed to be tortured. I must have masochistic streak or so it appears after this semester. I’m graduating in Neuroscience this year and I used to whine about getting a random B here and there. I’m now fighting for C’s so I can use the pass fail option. These assholes had the nerve to harshly grade these imaginary labs were doing. Just unbelievable

Tbh I feel like Mason did their best with the cards they were given. I understand that quality of education dropped and prices rose, and trust me I know how annoying the price increases are. It is also extremely frustrating to never receive a break throughout the semester. The lack of reading days is also very stressful. However, this is my hot take. The idea "Mason fucked us over" I feel like is pointing a finger at the wrong person/entity. I feel like each decision mason made was educated and calculated, they worked to secure public safety. If me facing extra stress is what comes from it, I cannot fault their decision. Quite honestly I feel like this all happened because there is a systematic problem with how this country, and various others, handled this pandemic. If we want to point fingers then we should look at ourselves and determine how to fight mis-information and determine how to handle these situations better. That's just my take. Just my take though

They did but you gotta take what you're given and make do

I promise it gets better. Assuming things get better

!!!!!! Took a semester off and this is my first semester. I thought it would be like any other regular semester with breaks and reading days but boy was I far from the truth.

This was my first semester too, it was absolutely brutal and I have 4 exams and 2 projects next week and im scared haha

Honestly you could consider transferring. It's the only way to make Mason feel the pain for being shitty like this.

Exactly. In addition to this, they're not getting any of my alumni dollars

I know it won't fix anything I just want to rant somewhere I can be supported lol

Imagine unethical price increases being chalked up to merely “annoying”... CHECK YO PRIVILEGE

im transferring to shenendoah university after this semester. lol

I support ya but I also support ya

So I personally don't really see how the price increases are fundamentally unethical, as my current understanding and the evidence I have seen suggests that price increases are being invested into administration, facilities, support services. Additionally compared to what the estimate of tuition increase applied to the state it has been reported to be lower than expected. If the price jump was put into Cabrera's pocket then I can see where you're coming from, but I think a lot of students have been asking for better administration, better support services, and better facilities. If you have evidence to show the contrary please let me know. I do know price increases have a historic relation to enforcing systemic racial and class segregation, but GMU's diversity is still well funded and well developed. Additionally, I understand my language may give off the appearance that high prices are minor inconveniences, but to be quite frank I've had to sell my car, I'm busting my ass working part time, and taking out crazy amount of loans to make end meets. But college isn't cheap but I don't wanna work a job that's gonna keep breaking my back.

Shenandoah is in some financial trouble. Choose your major wisely so it isn’t one where a department will get whacked.

You’re spot on. The situation absolutely sucks. But Mason is navigating just like every other higher ed institution. No spring break has been awful, but the trade off could have been higher COVID counts on campus. Admin has to make imperfect choices in an unclear, constantly changing, chaotic situation.

Fr though why sell if there is none 💀

I love paying over $400 a semester for a non guaranteed parking spot!!

I thought we had it bad, but my gf went to Northeastern in Boston and their parking was 2,000 dollars a year with an even lower chance of getting a spot since a ton of it was street parking

I either arrive at 730am, 930am, 130pm, or 330pm and I’ve never had trouble finding parking in Lot K

It’s just a hunting license. Doesn’t guarantee a kill.

should have got west campus pass, never full

Paper is paper

I’ve never paid for GMU parking. Always park on public roads and assemble my bicycle for a quick ride to class. I’ve done the math, it’s cheaper and literally faster for me to do that than to do that than parking. GMU needs to expand parking cuz it’s way too full and it is more of an inconvenience

I've never had issues. Where do you park?

I love paying 400 for a chance to be in the parking deck but having it full of commuters and having to park in lot K even if I’m right by northern neck

Only 3000 open spaces today

You’re the idiot because there’s a free parking spot just 10 minutes away

Its the same way that airlines can overbook planes. Scummy but its legal

we have it good here because gw lowest permit is 1K 😭

Yeah and also acceptance rate needs to go down

Nah I’d rather only have a 5 min walk to clsss and pay $400 than have to walk longer when it’s cold af

dog its like a 15 minute walk I had west campus all 4 years, never once used the bus

Well as we count empty spaces each day we have a pretty good idea. The only area that regularly fills is Rappahannock Deck general area (levels 1/2) and most of Lot A but since the general permit doesn’t guarantee space in a particular lot but is valid in Lots A,C,L,K,PV, M, O and P, we are averaging 1300 empty general spaces that permit holders can access. All the other types that are sold by a specific garage or lot location have spaces for those particular permit types as we control what we sell for each one.

Finals are coming up so let's just hope this works

We got this!! 💖💖

YOU GOT THIS SHIT FINALS AINT GOT NOTHING ON YOUR BIG OL' WRINKLY BRAIN 🧠

I have no finals and only one final paper that I've already turned in between me and graduation. It's all down to prayers at this point.

Smooth brain gang

Dang this brought back some memories of this show

Who you talking to? My brain is smooth as hell

Dude I have an exam this week, 2 exams next week and 2 finals, and a 1200 word paper

Same. I used to watch dragon tales so much

Well like you said, it's just a meme. >where are the memes about people that are still strong and not exhausted Idk, where are those people even?

God help you. That said, I started this degree in 2009 so I'm ready to be done.

this semester sucked

Are you graduating by the end of the semester?

Also started in 2009, also SO ready to be done!! Just a few presentations left 👏🏽

If I get a C or better on this final paper I graduate on May 14!

We can do this!!! :D

This semester has been super hard on a lot of people. I can say that it’s been hard on me because of no break, family issues and adjusting to my first time away from home. There aren’t any memes about people who are “still strong” because there just aren’t that many of them

Good luck on the paper and congratulations on graduating from the hell that is college. I wish you the best of luck in whatever you decide to do after leaving hell.

I'm working a well paying full time job fortunately, they just want me to have this rather expensive piece of paper. It will be a huge relief to have it done. Good luck with the finals, you've got this!

Please stop complaining about GMU -*It’s a commuter school* With over 27,000 undergraduate students in a busy suburban area, it’s kind of hard not to be. It’s not a commuter school if you’re a freshman. *It’s easy to get into* An 89% acceptance rate does not guarantee you’ll get in. The average GPA of incoming freshman is over 3.6 *It’s not a good school* World University Rankings ranked Mason 471 out of 20,966, US News ranked them 109 nationally and tied 52 in public universities, WSJ ranked them 33, Forbe’s American Colleges ranked them 40; yes, it’s a good school. *There’s no social life* That is a bit iffy. If you just go for classes then go home/back to your dorm, then obviously, you’re not going to have a social life. If you live on campus or are a commuter that spends most of your time on campus, then it’s easy to find something to do and clubs to join. When I was there 10+ years ago, most of my friends were commuters but were involved in groups. You have to go out and find things to do, very rarely will it come to you (ha, that rhymed). If you’re able to live on campus, I would strongly suggest doing so. I commuted my first two years then lived on campus the other two (I took six years), and it was a world of difference. *There’s no school spirit* That’s mainly true. The most school spirit I saw when I was there was when we went to the final four in basketball. Unfortunately, when most people graduate, that’s the end. Very few people I know go to their reunions. *They need a football team that’s not club* That’s not going to happen anytime soon. I think that’s the most common complaints I’ve seen. Please remember that you chose it.

Even if GMU doesn’t have a social life (it does) you’re right next to DC, can get on the shuttle for free, and ride the metro in for ten bucks. Plus go to the movies, stores, and plenty of other places freee. Plus walk right into downtown Fairfax. People need to realize that in college you’re not gonna be forced to make friends and have a social life like in HS. If you want a social life and night life you’re right by the city and you got to make the decision to do that. Sure, weekends are dead. Go into the cities and make your own fun.

I wish GMU gave me credit for my courses at NOVA though. That’s neither here or there now though.

What GMU in my opinion has always had going for it is the fact it's located in a densely populated area where it's more than welcomed for students who choose to commute to be able to receive a high quality education without the on-campus living expenses, and especially In-State with the tuition fees. Manassas Campus is expanding also in high-demand science sectors. You still get the college experience but again, what's the point of comparing to other Virginia State schools unless the set-up is similar? ODU is comparable, minus their NCAA football program which is fairly new.

As an incoming transfer, I was excited to be accepted. The costs for attending GMU are great for the benefits. Assistance with internships during school, help finding jobs after in competitive markets. This is one of the top schools in the nation. It just doesnt market itself as such. Which in my opinion is fantastic. Being more focused on education rather than pomp is great. For IT/Cyber, this is one of the best schools to attend in the region.

"I hate this school, this school sucks" My brother in christ, you chose to go to this school

THIS!! AHHH It makes me so angry to hear people at GMU complain about the school. I'm out of state dude, I came down from Massachusetts! I picked Mason because it is well regard and known to have an amazing criminology department- I was in no way disappointed with it and I still keep in touch with professors having graduated 3 years ago! The campus (before the constuction) was gorgeous, the buildings are really nice, there are always people around campus when it's the day, there are so many clubs, it's also one of the friendliest campuses I've ever been to! GMU is a good school, you literally picked it!

just set your priorities

Just want to mention that the Computer Science dept at GMU is highly regarded among its peers. CS grad students and researchers often reference [CSrankings.org](http://CSrankings.org), which puts GMU the top in VA for research.

For real, the college is what you make of it. I’m graduating this year and made a ton of friends, who are all commuters. If you want a social life then you have to learn to be social. I think that’s true for pretty much all colleges. Also gmu provides great education, and is very affordable. Additionally there are plenty of clubs, programs, and after class activities to participate in. Talking to others is an important life skill to have just in general.

I’ve lived near George Mason my whole life and even though I go to Georgetown, I can confirm George Mason is a good school. People don’t realize how good it is until you travel outside of North Virginia and see colleges like University of New Haven, Radford, ODU or even University of Delaware to some extent. People whine too much and if they want all the extra bells and whistles then they should work harder to go to a higher ranked college. At George Mason, I think you are getting pretty good value relative to the price tag…you are getting exactly what you paid for.

*when we went to the final four in basketball* 2006 was 18 years ago. There are current Mason student who are younger than the VCU game. It gets more embarrassing every year that people still talk about it.

Probably the worst problem is that their disability services office and policies are awful. Source: all my doctors

Also Mason's CS department is ranked #33, above Yale, UVA, Tech, and surprisingly Harvard at csrankings.org. Granted this is more post-grad focused

I loved GMU when I was there.

This guy is the GMU Reddit police

you’d be surprised at how many opportunities are actually given to GMU students in my experience at least, as a CS major the main problem is because it’s right next to all the government buildings u do need citizenship/clearance

Thank you geez

something people seem to miss regardless of age, is the school, like any other opportunity is entirely what you make it. it's a lot easier to complain and find blame after the fact than constantly make yourself available to take advantage of opportunities. most people don't know how to seize the moment and get distracted. putting down the school is just a way to cope. sometimes i hear complaints like these from former students and i think "yes, the school that's had decades of proud, successful alumni didn't work for you, so it must be a problem with the school!"

TBH, I complained a lot last year, which was my first sem, and I have grown to like it. It's not the worst, and it's not the best. It is what you make out of it, and tbh, the best part about Mason is the location. Yes, the competition is high, but you have so many opportunities around here, and the shuttle system is amazing. I get a shuttle straight to my work, which is heaven!!

I went to GMU 20 years ago, and what you wrote (and what many people have said in the replies) could be said then as well. That said, I really enjoyed it there and had no regrets! I had friends at "party" schools like WVU and I'm from Charlottesville so I've spent a lot of my life living in UVA's backyard, and I spent time with friends at other schools in the District proper. Sure, the social stuff is different, but it didn't make me dislike Mason. I still had a big group of friends on and off campus, we still went out, and we still had a lot of fun! I was there during the 2006 Final Four run too, *that* was fun. Admittedly, it gave me something to brag to my friends at the "fun" schools with the better known sports teams too 😅

I love this thank you. I feel grateful to be here even though I am guilty of complaining. I had health problems that made me drop out of high school despite skipping two grades in math when I was young. I felt defeated once I was 20 and the people on my level in middle school were graduating from prestigious universities while I had finally gotten into a place where I could start community college. I have to pay my tuition myself, out of pocket to avoid debt. I had a full time job the first semester at Mason and it was quite difficult in a STEM major. I feel like I’m missing out on a traditional college experience, but I have to give myself grace when I know hardly anyone had to put up with the things I had to put up with in middle/high school. I am grateful I can attend a beautiful campus with a distinguished faculty despite those obstacles.

Transferring out was the best decision I ever made

I always see (most of) these as fair, honestly. Yes we chose this school, I’m certainly not surprised by the results. However, that doesn’t mean we can’t express things we feel could improve. Also, posting on the school Reddit is a way to encourage other students to get more involved, not so much a criticism of the school itself. It’s nice to get your struggles out there, especially if you’re in the crowd that feels really isolated here.

People who say GMU doesn't have a social life is wrong. I actively avoid talking to people, and somehow, people always find a way to interact with me. So if you're trying to have a social life, you'll do fine

As a transfer student, is it useful to have a dorm for Junior year? I would want to get involved in the school but I may be only online because of my major but I’m hoping it’s Hybrid. My major is Cyber.

I have a pretty decent job and life because of GMU! An amazing university

What do you mean by “commuter school”? Most classes are scheduled during the day, making it difficult to balance work and study. With an acceptance rate of nearly 100%, the school is overcrowded, and there seems to be little to no standard for admitting students or hiring professors. Many of these professors have terrible ratings on Rate My Professors. For this reason alone, the school’s ratings are almost guaranteed to decline over time. The only reason I’m attending is that I work nearby.

one thing about GMU is that you need to just look for clubs you could join, it’s not obvious like the ones in high school where they actively looking for you to join, at GMU you have to search them yourself, I’m sure there’s one for everyone

Class of 08 here and 13, these comments are universal forever. But thank you for posting this. I can tell you as an alum x2 I made my fun - met my wife- and have countless other memories (yes the final four run was one of them my junior year) , and changed so much) and friends I’m still in touch with from my time at mason.

When you compare the GPA to GPAs of students in FCPS and surrounding counties it is pretty easy to get into. However, with the recent uptick in international students, it is harder. They're doing this on purpose btw to drive revenue which is what Richmond told Washington to do so.

Ngl the campus isn't a vibe some one killed one of the foxes recently too. Idk if it was Georgina or not. ANYWAYS FUCK GMU

I've been one of they few people defending this school for the past 5 years. It's the only university I ever applied to. The people making those posts/comments are 18 year old kids and hence think like kids. Those people tend to be under the impression that college should be a time of drinking and partying. When in reality all those things will still be available to you after college.

The professors are underpaid, the staff works under heavy stress, the students can’t get help right away. The bureaucracy in Mason is so bad, you trynna get some simple things done here you will have to talk to 3 different departments until you can finally talk to someone that’s able to help you. It’s the fact I go to this school and realize how bad it is. I think the social life aspect is completely up to each person, so that’s not a Mason problem. But this school don’t have a supportive system that help their students, the students have to go look for help themselves and they often don’t get what they needed. This school won’t listen to the people that works there, or goes there. Nobody takes pride going to this school and I think that just speaks volumes about how they all feel. I paid to go to this school and I did not receive any form of assistance but rather headaches; I became a better person by overcoming the bullshit GMU put me through instead of what they trynna “teach” me in school. Of course I have the right to say this school fucking sucks.

Stop telling people what they can or can’t complain about how bout that

Exactly I love being near DC

They lied to me about which classes would transfer

oh this is good to know, someone should go into the nova subreddit and let them know about this. I assumed NOVA and GMU had special communication about this. Of course they are going to look for a way for you to pay double for the same course.

Honestly the best part in my opinion about GMU is how it’s in such a densely populated area with a lot of government contract work. I’ve talked to people who went to Tech, UVA, or JMU. They had a much harder time finding internships and jobs right out of college since they had little to no real job experience. Here you can easily get a summer job, and if you can’t, you can get a job during the school year since all the people living in nova went down to their jmu, uva, tech schools (granted some people don’t work during school). GMU lends you a ton of opportunities and I think that’s honestly its strongest point if you aren’t looking for big social life. I stopped working part time as a waiter after my sophomore year and went from internship to internship which paid more than waiting tables, was relevant to my job field, and gave me a job after college.

I made that decision during the pandemic. I'm allowed to regret it now 😭

biggest mistake of my life fr

Idk why you can’t say this school sucks when you go there, it’s the fact that I go there and realize how shitty this school is. Will it make sense I complain about Harvard? I don’t even go there

I just regret the sparse course offerings within finance 😢

Agreed! If you want a social life, work towards a social campus life! There’s plenty of things to do if you try.

Exactly why I chose GMU, actually. And somehow we’re number one in creative writing, which was another path I was considering.

My first proper photo of Mason

I would really appreciate if someone could get a hold of gmu marketing team. Ive been trying for a long time to send them campus photos.

The sun & sky carried this photo. It's so pretty! Nice job!

Slap it on a post card and get your money.

Monetize your photography skills lol

Was this taken on the top of Rappahannock Parking Deck?

*G O R G E O U S*

Great photo OP. Pics like this make you forget the mayhem we call parking haha

Very nice photo!

THIS IS GORGEOUS. If they ask you for it, make sure to get some money out of it😉

This is sooo nice!❤️

this makes me miss gmu so much!! great picture:)

Proper photo

HDR turned up to 9000

You could certainly reach out to the Office of University Branding, but they do have full time photographers on staff, so you may not have much luck if you’re looking to sell your photos to the university.

Now you may be onto something here. Gonna take a look into it. Thanks for the idea!

Thank you! I'll be working on some new shots this week. Want to go around campus and capture different angles

Your welcome it's a great view of the campus and a nice money shot too.

be sure to post them!! i’d love to see the pictures 💚

Will do! Either here or on insta @eduardomacedo21 is my page if you want to give a follow :)

just followed!

There is no war in Ba Sing Se. There is no corruption at GMU.

I'm a simple person. I see aatnas2 I upvote

The Chemistry Department one is spot on.

I feel out of the loop what is/was AATANAS 2?

Are you with me?

the office of academic integrity one was spot on

Keeping the clips off the bar in bench press is so that you can dump the weights if need be.

Yo can we post this on the barstool IG? We’ll give credits and if you dm us we can also tag your ig. This is gold, I wanted to make something like this before but it’s very complicated lmao.

This is gold

I think I have multiple roles

there is no scarcity within the walls

They'd rather you just go ahead and crush your torso like an empty Pringle can than damage the floor of their gym though, so

The Gym people will bother you if you don't use clips or if you drop weights

Its okay, I have now morphed into the online student.

I can understand not wanting weights dropped from deadlift or squats but damn if you're stomach is about to be crushed who gives a fuck about the floor.

Just Incase you need a good laugh

Teacher: I have been tricked, backstabbed, and quite possibly bamboozled.

Imagine the respect if the professor did that to the student.

if my professor does live lectures like this im definitely gonna do it she must be bamboozled at all costs for bamboozling the students with no mercy

Or, say you cannot hear the professor, say “it might be because of malware on your pc, simply delete system32 folder cause that’s where it sits :)”

They wouldn’t know how to get there.

True that. I guess help them navigate lol

Hope the admins see this and realized they are clowns

Whoever put that up is brave. Im nervous about saying anything in general; when I got selected for randomized testing, everyone who was working there side eyed/judged me for being skeptical. I felt really bad for trusting my gut and wanting testing somewhere else. I really hope that GMU president hears our concerns and does something.

JMU has ~200 cases, VCU lists the # of both student and employee active cases. How many cases are at GMU?

Oh don't worry, more frequent randomized MANDATORY tests being required for students, voluntary for Staff 🤔

Keep in mind, if you opted out of the information sharing form that was presented to you when you finished the back to school covid training, if you opted in to the randomized testing, you just opted back in to the information sharing. And now that it's mandatory, it seems that they're only giving you the illusion of choice now :/

Edit: Don’t have proof about Kallaco test claim, heard it through rumors. My bad. Article is legit though. Love the passion, but Mason has stopped using Kallaco tests.... Also, you can read the analysis by the associate dean of research for College of Science. Pretty sure he has everything to lose if he were to be dishonest. [https://www2.gmu.edu/news/588251](https://www2.gmu.edu/news/588251)

Let’s put one up about Blackboard, too.

Lol I hope they see the poster too. How about having us in thousand dollar dorms, saying "We'll have a mix of online and in person classes." Then offer 90% online classes, THEN change the few in-person classes to online, last minute. Then on top of that, have the nerve to not have working ethernet ports. Lol you have me here paying 1k for a dorm during a pandemic where I can't even use my pc to attend class and do homework? I had to use my phone for near a week. Their priorities are pretty obvious imo. But they're doing slightly better than other universities supposedly, they made sure to mention that in the emails 🙄. But let's be honest, the bar is low .

Boy that’ll teach em

Mason Student Resistance What a joke. You chose to come here. They take themselves way too seriously. Like good message, but fuck what a stupid group name.

You guys know Kallaco isn't doing the tests right? You know you could take the semester off right?

Lol I did shit like this for indigenous peoples day at gmu and some highways

10 total. You can go to the data dashboard found on this page: [https://www2.gmu.edu/mason-covid-health-check](https://www2.gmu.edu/mason-covid-health-check) for the breakdown.

a Dean writing a message at the behest of the President has a *lot* more to lose by not saying what the President wants, than by being dishonest. Or let's not say "dishonest": let's say, "deliberately using hedge words and twisting the arguments made by critics so as to minimize them." because that's what he does, especially about the home sample collection issue--and the secondary issue that he does not mention, which is whether the results obtained via that round of testing should be considered valid (they shouldn't).

they subcontract to Opteo labs. so what? Kallaco is the company WM paid.

I feel like I could be wrongfully punished for wanting a safer option. There's a power dynamic that makes it difficult for us to stand up for ourselves.

The only issue is they aren’t listing all tests yet, only a portion of the Kallaco tests. They’ve listed 543 total student tests, all from the past 3 weeks (none this week so far), up from 521 at the beginning of the week. So we’re missing data on about 4000 tests

For the sake of your argument, let's say that the President is telling the dean to disseminate false information. Option 1) Dean says no, shares accurate scientific analysis - leaders are mad, but dean has respect of scientific community and can easily get another high-ranking job. Option 2) Dean goes with the flow, intentionally shares incorrect scientific information with the community - loses respect/confidence of entire science community, no one will ever work with him or publish him again. Lose his position with National Center for Biodefense and Infectious Diseases. Lose his position with Virginia Drug Discovery Consortium. Lose his position with Virginia Catalyst. Blacklisted from receiving private institution funding/grant money for his projects.

> Love the passion, but Mason has stopped using Kallaco test kits.... Where does it say this...?

This semester I have seen people hitting them. I bet this was not an accident sadly

These things should have National Guard escorts /s

Too many wheels. They gotta consolidate and make the robot a trike.

Finish the job, soldier

It’s gonna have sick stories when sitting down in a bar with other robots

Why 6 wheels tho?

Remember when people used to walk together to dining halls to get food

People treat these things so bad, like their just trying to do their jobs 😭

Allows them to climb small obstacles like curb, more grip/ more point of contact on the ground means they don’t stick in mud (seen some cars wheels slipping in mud and they are stuck?), also they can move in an uneven terrain, and for accidents like this the robot is still moving.

You don’t understand You don’t understand, this school has meant so much to me and now it is finally over, I am graduating. I spend the greatest two years of my life (so far) here and I don’t regret a second. I am so happy that I am finally moving on to greater things, but it is very bittersweet. I dropped out of university and eventually went to community college before transferring here. I am a commuter, but Mason became an escape from my life and a vibrant place where I felt like I could totally be myself; amidst the cold winters and the beckoning springs. I will miss it, but in my life I will try to give to others what this place has given me, a sense of belonging. Thank you.

Congratulations, GMU is proud of you

Well done soldier 🫡. Never stop learning though

I also did the NOVA -> GMU pipeline. I gotta say my two years at GMU were filled with classes that I wanted to do. I was also a commuter but I spent most of my time at Mason. I met my wife. I met many of my best friends. I met the place that I’d find my job. I’m so glad you had a good time. Good luck in your future!

I totally understand!! My first run of college (nursing) kinda sucked. But when I decided to change careers and came to Mason.... wow!! I loved every minute of it. I still miss it after 10+ years.

I felt the exact same way last year before graduating 💚💛

I graduated last year and it was so bittersweet...I legitimately miss being at gmu lol you adjust to your new life and everything's gonna be awesome :)

Same. GMU is also my escape from life. And a break from my toddler! 😂 God knows I need it.

30 years out and I feel the same way and still savor the memory of that final walk and memories made with new friends then that are old friends now (and a wife!). Congrats.

Wow I’m the opposite I can’t wait to get out of here and start working. After spending time at Lockheed Martin, it was so much more fun than sitting through theory classes in engineering

Graduating will be so weird once I get there(hoping I do) wow

i also went to CC before transferring! I'm a junior rn and it's my first semester as a transfer student. Honestly I don't know how to make fun memories as a commuter. can I ask what organizations or clubs you were a part of? how involved were u on campus? i want to have a great experience here too! congratulations!!!!

Until you return for grad school! They never let me go! I finally finished all of the course work for my PhD though and it is on to the proposal and dissertation.

Same. GMU is great. Feels like its own mini city. Walkable, Good parking, good social clubs

theory classes? Also imo the classes are the interesting part

I think part of it is being spontaneous and maybe willing to put yourself out there. My first semester I saw a flier for auditions for a play, and I had never acted in my entire life, ended up in two plays. I was really bad at acting, but I didn’t care, it was fun! I got involved with LSA (latin student association) and the French Club and went to their general body meetings. I also signed up for the intramural sports leagues; that was great! Those were the highlights, I didn’t do much else (I considered doing the international buddy program), because I wanted that good balance and had commitments back home anyway. But it was great. If you haven’t already, sign up for mason 360 and you can see all the clubs on there and keep up with events.

F, how in the world does this happen

I have seen this happen in the work place. Not a big deal considering they didn’t say anything inappropriate AND a lot of other people may have the same question. Now what makes it bad is when everyone on that e-mail replies to all and asks to be removed 😂😂

The worst part is she has a photo on her email. I wonder how many people on campus can recognize her and say hello.

F... unfortunate mistake but at least it's not a weird question or anything

Honest mistake but RIP

Oh no, this isn’t aatanas2 all over again is it?

ong I’m gunna reply all with my twitch url

As others have pointed out, it is trivial to have permissions set up so that this kind of thing doesn’t happen. Only some people should be able to email a huge distro, and no replies should be honored unless it happens to be from the allow list. The other simple way to do this is to use BCC. But mason chooses option 3, which is lazy dumb fuckery.

Aatanas2 lives on

Why block the name when we all know lol. But answer the question “would that be allowed ?”

this happened at mcmaster a while ago, people were spamming everyone on the mailing list it was a beautiful moment for us. idk how i ended up on this sub but i hope the grad student at mason is allowed to bring his high school junior and senior and family

I’d literally cry

If you select "reply", you will just reply to the listserv sender. However if you select "reply all", then you will reply to the whole listserv. Which is probably what this student did. Honest mistake that can happen to anyone, no need to point fingers.

Exactly, the listserv has settings specifically for preventing this. Someone messed up when sending out that initial email

What's bad about it though?

You click reply to all. I mean it happens, its all good.

At least for Gmail, reply-all is usually the default if you just type in the reply box and hit send. This probably happens A LOT.

Unsubscribe

Reply all: please remove me from this

It's not fair, all because of eagle bank.

wow what a memory

I think this is up to the department etc, Mason absolutely has the *capability* to allowlist a listserv, I’ve done it

oh my god this school is in virginia, why am i here….WELL HI EVERYONE mcmaster is in ontario and we say hi to you all :))))

He/she has a family! How embarrassing!!!!!

I was sadly only there a year and it was the only exciting thing I remember happening aside from all the construction starting

Hello fellow neighbor to the north, things are cold up there aye?

Not even, the listserv is supposed to have viewers vs posters. Someone fucked up the listserv settings.

hello!!! we had snowstorms on tuesday, spring is not springing 😭

Yea I really don’t understand what the problem is.

Please just end my suffering.

Freaking aye yes it’s just a weird circle jerk of pats on the back for doing mediocre work.

Great insight. I really feel like you captured the essence of the meme with your title!

Especially when it’s a 500 word initial post and a 300 word response… I just have to reword “I agree” 150 times 😪

It’s even worse when the questions you have to answer for the original post are straight up finding definitions that aren’t really up for different interpretation, so it makes the reply part damn near pointless.

Paint without the t

Almost bad enough to make me throw up. It is like the college version of your parents forcing you to dance with some other kid at an event

Blackboard is such pain sometimes I rather have Canvas

Great Point Picasso! I completely agree with the points you made! Well said.

I'm looking at you IT293 you big old waste of money and time

[I like dogs too](https://www.reddit.com/r/gmu/comments/ifylux/discussion_boards_be_like/)

Spend more time with your dogs. In times of loneliness and despair, they bring joy. I bought 4 dogs ever since everything went online

Tautology is an art form.

New Bb < Canvas < Old Bb

What I loved about Canvas at Germanna Community College (they switched from old BB during my 2nd-to-last Semester) was it gave the professors zero flexibility. No course content randomly thrown in 20 different places they totally made up, no full-course grades or scary-looking dummy items without all of the actual assignments itemized in the gradebook, no hunting for half an hour to find office hours and which of the listed Zoom links, phone numbers, and collaborate sessions they actually answer to. Canvas is the digital version of a square classroom with a professor's desk, student desks, a whiteboard, a projector, and a podium with a gradebook inside. If the professor doesn't want to learn how to use it as-is, or thinks it's not good enough for their "teaching style," what they can do is quit their job.

OMG guys I'm receiving free COVID-19!!

GMU really was like “we can’t give you lower tuition rates”, “but here is a deadly virus 😘”

Oh wow. What a deal!

That’s sick

I laughed at that too lmaoo

Is it a covid test? Or a covid vaccine? I got the same email lol. I got tested for free and turn out negative!

Imagine Mason giving out free covid

Must be a typo on Mason’s part. I still had to pay for mine.

One of the many perks of being a GMU student

GMU is so smart, they sell both the virus and the vaccine

online is even worse

Lmfao & its still not enough..

The best i can do is 30 minutes

i swear they assume we have even more time now that we’re online so much unnecessary busy work

Bruhh this is so true

Professor: So what have you guys been up to? Students: just hanging in. Staying healthy. Catching up on Stranger Things and all that. Professor: Good! That means you can handle three essays, a quiz and two exams in one week along with your usual homework! Students: uh.... is it too late to take a gap year?

I straight up tell them I work full time on top of courses, so far they've understood.

When u have a job and work throughout the day but then professors assign even more assignments bc there’s 24 hours in a day, it’s like they forget that people actually need to sleep

with a 25 min break

Oh and on cake day, what joy

George Mason’s Observatory I don’t see too much posted here about our Observatory that’s on campus, wanted to make a quick post about it! I’m not sure too many students know, but it’s the largest telescope in VA. If you’re interested in visiting our observatory, tours are regularly held and open to everyone on Wednesday, Thursday, and Saturday evenings (as well as completely free to attend.) During each tour, you’ll get to look through its eyepiece, visit the control room, stargaze, and learn about the facility. For fun, there’s some of our best astrophotography we’ve taken with it so far.🪐 We’ve got some big events planned for the upcoming Solar Eclipse this month!☀️ Feel free to AMA about it, I work as a tour guide there👍🔭

We have an observatory?! Biggest in Virginia?!Why don’t they talk about this in their brochures and pamphlets? This is the first time I’ve ever heard of this.

This is awesome! Are the tours all ages? I'd love to bring my kids.

This is a great post! I’ve been at Mason forever and have never managed to see this first hand. The few times I tried it was storming or overcast. I will see if I can go next week

When I was attending GMU, a group of us booked one of the meeting rooms in the observatory every week to play d&d. Top floor, room on the left. A year or so after graduation, I contacted the school and was able to book the room again so I could propose to my then-girlfriend. We'd gotten to know each other during these d&d games. Wonderful timing to see this post because today we celebrated 4 years of marriage, and have been together for almost 8. Go see the observatory, everyone.It's a cool place.

Pretty shocked Mason doesn't advertise this more. I've been here 3 1/2 years and had no idea it existed. (On a side note, maybe light pollution is an issue?)

Behold, the mighty GMU Observatory

Can you please post the link to sign up for a tour?

What time???

I passed this on Wednesday and had to take a pic!! I saw the telescope on the bottoms floor and was intrigued thanks for letting us know!

One of my only regrets as a recent grad is that I never made the time to actually visit the observatory. I’d pass by it every day when I lived at Potomac Heights or was going to the Engineering building, and everytime I said I’ll go in this week. Seems like I gotta make plans to show up this fall because this is so cool!

woahhh i def gotta go visit it

looks like the sail of a soviet submarine

They are regular tours open to all ✨

Amazing thanks for sharing!

great pics 🫡

Just beautiful

We’ve been working on our outreach recently😔. Not enough people know about how open we are. Been operational since 2011 lol

Didn’t know either lol

Absolutely, we have a step ladder to bring them up to the eyepiece if need be👍. Our smaller astronomers really enjoy seeing Saturns rings and Jupiter’s moons on clear nights. Some more info with location and times can be found here: [[GMU Observatory]](https://sites.google.com/view/georgemasonobservatory/visit)

it's really cool, I highly recommend it. I never went while I was a student but my roommate who still is took me sometime last winter. Totally worth it.

Thank you! Definitely stop by one night for a visit. I’ve noticed a lot of Mason students don’t even know we have an Observatory - I’ve heard people assume that it was a grain silo or water tower😖.

😭😭😭That’s the sweetest thing I’ve ever heard. Thank you for sharing this😭

Light pollution is a big issue, you’re right 😔. Our greatest enemy at the Observatory is Enterprise Hall lol. They’ve built those four light towers that shine throughout the entire night and wash out a lot of our images.

No need! To attend, head to the lobby of Research Hall, the building connected to the Observatory. Observatory tour guides will be down there at the reception desk to welcome guests up to the roof👍

Come by Research Hall at 7:15pm! Either tonight for a closed dome tour of the observatory due to clouds, or a future Public event any other Wednesday, Thursday, or Saturday night.

I knew it was an observatory but I never figured it was this open, I guess I always imagined you had to take a relevant class/major to get time on it.

What times are the tours usually held?

Public tours will start at 7:15pm and usually last about an hour. Since the Sun is setting earlier and earlier as the year goes on, this time will change to 6:45 starting on Oct. 23rd.

Is 715 the only time?

Every Wednesday, Thursday, and Saturday evenings 👍

Yep, during other night of the week, the Observatory is used for Research and Astrophotography Projects.

Fox by Buchanan this morning!

Can I pet that dawg?

There's definitely a population of foxes around campus. I've seen them off and on since 2020. I have a fox skull that I found sitting on top of a pile of mulch along Patriot Circle last year.

Bro forgot something

Hi, yes, I lived next to gmu, and a litter of foxes was birthed in my back yard during covid. This is their home. They like to watch tv. They like to be close to you. They are curious. If you don't harm them, they won't harm you. I love all animals. Hope you all take care.

What did he say?

I saw one the other night outside my dorm that was also surprising really close to people. This one kid got like two arms lengths away from it and took pictures!

Maybe he is friends with the squirrel in the trash can in front of Buchanan.

It’s worrisome to me that this fox isn’t scared of people. It can indicate disease and/or socialization issues.

Omg, he's so cute. I wonder, what classes he had today.

He's after our chipmunks!!!

He looks like a young one.

Bro’s lost. Let him find his enlightenment 🦊🤗

It’s time for the hunt!

a fox SKULL????????

I also learned in a zoology class that it’s been observed as an evolutionary trait in foxes too. Natural habitats for foxes have been running very low in several places, so foxes have started to survive more on living among people, digging through trash and such at night or early morning/evening. In order to do that, they need to be less afraid of humans

Most of the foxes in Fairfax are pretty chill around people. Just a part of being a fox in a city. I agree we should still be wary around them, however.

Yeah it was definitely not afraid of me at all.. I hesitated a bit when I started to record lol

That’s true, definitely could be a possibility. I just don’t want someone to get bit because it can be a death sentence for the little guy.

A map for nervous shitters at GMU Fairfax [OC]

God bless planetary hall. Glorious moments I’ve had there.

In case of emergency, there's also a pond

Bathrooms at global center are super nice change it to green

As an ibs sufferer 5th floor fenwick is a peak shitting location. Clean and empty👏🏼

Not all heroes wear capes.

Krug Hall bathrooms are so nasty man.

There is a one toilet bathroom on the roof of planetary near the telescope.

Aquia building is the best, always empty bathrooms and there’s a microwave

Map is outdated with robinson A and B no longer existing. Personally I would rate Horizon Hall as yellow. It can get busy but at night its chill, especially if you go to the top most area where theres glass walls. Thats typically a quiet space.

Remember I almost shit myself on the way from Johnson Center to West Campus at 10:30pm after my last class all the facility bathrooms were closed the softball and baseball bathrooms were also locked I had to shit in the woods off of west campus drive

Sorry I don’t have any awards to give you

Thanks for sharing bro 😎 now I feel safe doing my 10 am

my second shit this mornign was so good

I shat at building 44 near rogers hall and it was exquisite

My secret shitting spot remains hidden. Good.

Why is Hanover hall the only dorm with green rating?

Carow Hall can be put in the yellow category. Bathrooms are usually empty, old but clean enough, however the building is on the edges of campus and is rarely used by students so it’s not an ideal location.

Why post this for everyone? Greens will become reds…

Sci tech campus, bio engr building….ELITE, 5/5 star quality, last I recall

Lecture hall is is such a POS!

Sub 1 single stalls are good tho

Unless something changed, Thompson hall 2nd floor was my go to.

I love the superiority of being able to shit wherever, I don’t fear shitting in public but you all should fear me

*IM GONNA FIND YOU AND IM GONNA MAKE FARTING NOISES!!!*

Disagree on Research hall. Had some decent shits In there

saving - incoming freshie

as a freshie who’s still finding their way on their third day, i know EXACTLY where planetary is only for this reason

I thought for a long time about marking the statue, clock, and pond as rare use instead of no use.

Thanks for your data. The last time I was there it was treated as very poorly. I'll update it.

SHHHHHH damn, baby, be cool! I'm gonna be so mad if someone's in my secret Fenwick bathroom next time, I swear.

I should have just grayed them out, but I kinda assumed that when they come back in their new form they will still be disgusting

And how was it? If the woods are a good option I want to reflect it in my notes

All good. I'm just glad people seem to enjoy this information

Great question. Hanover is not truly a housing space. It has a couple of classrooms and housing for the local Housing Department Head meaning it's super low foot traffic and accessible, but it gets cleaned regularly because GMU staff live there.

Hanover is not technically a dorm building. it's for community events, study rooms, and **mostly used as a kitchen for the surrounding dorms**. No one actually lives there to my knowledge.

It's the only one you can get into without living there because it's a front desk building with laundry facilities.

I've never been inside. Maybe next time I'm back. Thanks for the recommendation!

It’s also got a radiator in the stall to keep you nice and toasty on those cold winter mornings.

*Alexa make a long and stinky fart*

LOL yes the statue and clock are good options

Yeah, its a completely new building so it looks super nice. Only downer is some of the outlets are dead cuz electrical engineering is hard I guess.

Oh, I just now realise the title is very literal. I thought it meant nervous shitters as in want to be away from people on general lmao. Well regardless I thiink the top floor study room in horizon has a small bathroom. May be incorrect, will check when I have the chance Edit: Another spot is Ground floor johnson center, two single toilet bathrooms down the left hallway if you’re facing dewberry hall by the yellow marked service elevator. Its also cleaned very regularly.

The RD of the commons lives there iirc, but they have their own private apartment with their own bathroom

Yes and their office is also there and so the public restroom is considered a back-up

happened in my class today

¿Can you hear me now?

Skype? Lmao duck that, lets use Discord

The joke would have been better if it hadn’t explained itself.

VCU and Virginia Tech have already moved classes to online for the entire semester. GMU will do the same come April 3rd. They will be seen as incredibly negligent if they don’t and will catch a lot of heat

I think you forgot this /s

I’m not too sure GMU would care if they took heat for that.

What's that?

I disagree. Any reputable institution would care about well.. their reputation. It’s about damage control. I know that we love to hate GMU and poke fun about how they poorly handle a situation but there is no way we are going back. Especially since we are only going to see cases grow, and I wouldn’t be surprised if some GMU students get COVID-19. If VT and VCU closed when all of the cases in VA are centered around NOVA, then GMU will close too. Its only a matter of time

/s is used when you want other redditors to take you seriously

That’s a fair take. I guess we will see

Like I said before, GMU is the Internet Explorer of universities.

No /s is for sarcasm

You forgot the /s

??????? I wasn’t being sarcastic

Yea, you were being serious, so you shoulda used /s

Oh my goodness

From r/Cornell

I don’t mine the online lectures too much tbh. Studying from home is what’s difficult for me. I usually stayed on campus cause I get too distracted :/

Feelin this one. My boomer bunz were not built for this. Lol

Just turn up the lectures to 1.5x speed and pull out Minecraft

This seems a bit extreme.

Why not just use lockdown browser with the respondus monitoring at this point?

I’m on Same boat as you 😂. It’s ridiculous we have to have zoom connection on our phone to take this exam + lock down browser camera. I have no issue with lockdown browser camera but this second one seems extreme. Anyways, we are almost done 😂. Also have you looked at practice exam yet? It’s 169 questions 😅.

I will never understand how this prepares us for the “real world”. In a real IT job, you are often working in a team, and can access any resources you need to get the job done.

What class is this so I know to avoid this professor.

I would be messaging other students to join in on a mass email to the Dean so fucking fast, holy shit

Lol,,, then professors should give us a computer,,,

I’m so fucking done with 214, I haven’t learned shit since I started and I’m set to fail this semester. It’s horribly designed and they haven’t taught us half of the things they want us to use. How can I get this class changed? I cannot go through this again next semester... EDIT: I also have a learning disability and there is no way in hell I’m going to be able to concentrate under those conditions, I naturally look around while taking a test

This is abuse and disgusting don’t tolerate it

Are they even allowed to do this? Was this stated in the syllabus? Not everyone has 2 devices....

People don't have enough bandwidth to connect one device let alone two with lock down browser and video.

Lol this is absurd. Things are much different in grad school.

If this is the professor I think it is, it will be hard to get out of this situation. I had this same standard in a graduate IT class and he has the option of doing the exam face-to-face if you can't provide an additional camera. So yeah just study and pick your poison :(

Oh absolutely not, this is misconduct at its finest. Also discriminatory...how could you assume students have an extra device readily available? My god

it214 has been miserable for me.

Who the hell is he?

This professor sounds like one of those people that make their icebreaker question unnecessarily difficult to retain some weird form of superiority

This person has trust issues

My CS 480 professor was off the deep end for the start and middle of the semester and when he asked us to do this same thing for the midterm, we took it to the dean. The professor suddenly came to his senses and started being very reasonable.

I would have a panic attack if I saw this. I only have a laptop Edit: thanks for the award 🥺

the final is 169 questions and with 2 hours a 40 min time limit

This can’t be allowed man email the dean this is invasion of privacy

This is ridiculous

Professors really out here losing their minds to make us lose our minds

I apologize for the stress this may cause.

It’s not the professor, it’s the course coordinator for 214. I was in 314 last semester and we had the same concept of taking a midterm/final.

What an absurd and over reaction to prevent and catch cheating. I find the Respondus browser to be awkward; I can't imagine having 2 devices record video and audio of me and the room.

A good professor would have design an exam which won't allow students to have enough time to cheat

How are you supposed to go to class and actually learn, sheesh let them cheat.

I had to do this for my placement exams. What a pain in the ass

The math placement test works this exact way.

I thought I’ve seen it all

lemme guess: IT 214?

Lol this is how I’ve been taking some of my exams this semester though. Most my classmates kinda like it better bc the zoom video isn’t much of a distraction and a bitch compared to the lockdown browser video (like it has a more chill vibe to it).

Omg thought it’s only my class lmao. We’ve been doing this for every exams🤦‍♀️ gives me so much anxiety

What class is this and professor. Share the name sweetie. Expose them!

giving me IT 214 flashbacks lol

I guess that’s not good enough. I think we have to use responded monitoring plus zoom.

I would 100% report them but I don’t know where to start.

I just want the assignments to be marked by humans rather than the stupid preset answers with typos they have in place.

This so extreme. No one should need to go to the bathroom to take an exam just to avoid a door and a window...

A door? What could that possibly manage to solve by being behind you.

No not yet, I’ve been working other projects haha. I’ll probably get to it by Thursday.

In a real IT job, you’re searching for answers on StackOverflow.

I think it's to protect the integrity of the degree. Although, yeah I agree with you, it's bullshit

Breh. I bought lazy readers so I can see my laptop on my chest while I lie flat on my bed. If you dont know what lazy readers are.. google it. Picture these two images merged together ಠ_ಠ

Can't be more true 😭

Nothing more accurate

lmao that's an awesome pic

lol this is so true

What ? You don't work ?

Bruh moment right here.

Calling out Dr. Winston for Making Me Cry I don't know who this guy thinks he is but he has no God damn business being so **WHOLESOME**. This has been an incredibly difficult semester, so I just thought I'd share the love and remind everyone that despite how it feels, some professors really do be out here rooting for us with genuine love and support. Just hang in there, you're in the homestretch. And don't forget that you have until January 25th to [select the alternative grade mode](https://registrar.gmu.edu/students/registration/fall-2020-academic-options/). https://preview.redd.it/qiymbifdgm461.png?width=577&format=png&auto=webp&s=bdcb07c2590dd1878dcaf1c2771cdf7f2b4afadf https://preview.redd.it/i7z5lwpygm461.png?width=858&format=png&auto=webp&s=9904477386354e0271bf3579e0d04841f8f72eda

I highly appreciate supportive professors! This is extremely nice

Professor Winston has inspired me, and will always inspire me to love my field in cyber security, but also be respectful of others. He’s truly one of a kind.

The title of this post had me thinking it was going to be a rant, glad that it wasn’t. I wish there was more teachers like this

Winston forever the GOAT. He deleted his reddit account, probably a good decision, but I assume he still pokes around the sub occasionally. Hopefully he sees the appreciation that you and everyone else has for him as well.

He is the best professor I ever had. Im sad I won’t have him next semester. But I’m happy I got to have him 5 times. Each time he was by far the best and the most caring professor. I know he’s off reddit but I hope he can see this thread. I hope GMU and CYSE realizes the diamond that they have and keep this great man for years.

Prof Winston is an amazing person. I have him for 480/492 he is a god.

Glad to hear you enjoyed him! I had him for his last semester before he transferred over to the CS department from IT. Only had one class with him and he was wonderful

I remember someone said Jones did something like this too. Rare professors.

Professor Winston is an exceptional professor. He truly cares about his students.

Dr.Winston is just amazing!!!

Winston is hands down the best professor at mason, period

I graduated recently and he comments on my LinkedIn all the time. Great person.

Professors and teachers like this are so special. We need more like them! We love to see it <3

EVERY professor shoudl strive to be like him

Dr. Winston is truly the best professor I’ve seen. I really hope to be able to take classes with him in the future.

I had an ENGH 302 professor like that (Brandon Biller). He was the best and sooo supportive. Told me I will be great in graduate school on my last assignment. We need more professors like them, especially now more than ever before!

I hope everyone is staying healthy and safe throughout this crazy time

I kinda want to pass/fail all my classes and do the bare minimum amount of work

It’s been crazy as hell juggling school, work, family, finances, and COVID-19 apocalypse survival at the same time

Btw, how do we apply for the pass/fail? Just email the professors, or is through patriotweb or something?

I can't imagine how difficult to impossible it is for some students. If I had to do this and go back to be with my parents because I lost my housing, I would absolutely fail. The academic obligations I agreed to meant living independent of them, abusive narcicists. And that is with relative privelage, my old apartments had entire families living in a studio. How is even the best student supposed to pass in those environments? Thank God I'm out of school.

According to what my professor told my class, no. Do not email your professors. To avoid being biased, your professors should not know that you are doing pass/fail. They will continue to grade all of your work as normal.

You should’ve gotten an email like yesterday with instructions

Go to the [registrar.gmu.edu](https://registrar.gmu.edu) website - there are FAQs there which will take you through the steps.

at least it's not papyrus

Any intern at any capacity can do a better job than this, trust me

It's so it can be easily portable font wise on mobile apps. Personally I think that small issue isn't worth how worse these new logos like Mason's new logo or for another example Juventus's logo change are.

This reminds me when Tropicana changed their original OJ box art [to some minimalist BS](https://www.greatideasforteachingmarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Tropicana_Packaging_before_after.jpg)—which subsequently caused their sales to decline, forcing them to revert back. https://www.greatideasforteachingmarketing.com/tropicanas-packaging-case-study/

LMFAO. Another reason this is a shitty logo. It's supposed to be GM for George Mason.

Guys, I actually love this new logo! It accurately describes the Brand Office’s use of our tuition money.

I knew it looked familiar! Maybe those guys can come pick it up! ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|smile)

Hopefully, they can pick up the recycling. Because our logo appears to be recycled.

Oh I'm gonna go sell this to William and Mary

Perfect representation of where our all tuitions are going!

You go to William and Mary? 😂

The rebranding is insane. Why were students not consulted about it? Who thought it would be a good idea to rebrand out of the blue without seeing if a single student even liked the new design. Its honestly embarrasing how disconnected GMU leadership is from the student body. On a positive note, this is is the most united GMU students have been for a while... probably since the last branding failure, the gunston rebrand.

The email saying it took 3 years of work for this logo redesign...just for it to look like it was made last minute 😭

They’ve been fucking up for awhile. I’m an alumni but my last year at Mason they renamed the law school after Antonin Scalia and didn’t even notice the initials spelled ASS. It made headlines and a ton of articles were written so now when you google ‘Scalia Ass’ GMU pops up.

not one graphic design student ive talked to likes it

people who still call it the "patriot center": first time?

if they took avt 414 they would definitely fail

I thought my heartbreak was the worst thing to happen in 2024...turns out it’s this shitty logo design instead

The fact that the barstool page did a better job

The thing I don’t get is that they’re claiming the rebrand celebrates the significance of being a tier 1 research institute, which is a big deal. And yet there’s a disconnect because the rebrand was led by Mason athletics… So either you lean into a reputation as a serious academic institute or you lean into a reputation for strong athletics, but you gotta pick one because there’s a big difference between those target audiences. Also it literally looks like they paid someone on fiverr to do it.

If it doesn't make sense, follow the money.

Someone post the new logo?

The "stakeholders" (donors and admin) want money and somehow this will get them that. Possibly just because rich people donors like the look of it and will pull out if they don't get their way.

Bring Back Gunston!

William & Mary did a similar rebrand to a pointer logo. It was also widely disliked by students but went through. https://www.wm.edu/news/stories/2018/william-mary-athletics-reveals-revitalized-brand-and-logo.php Y’all’s is worse though.

What’s the Gunston rebrand?

It’s embarrassing how disconnected profs are from leadership and the tiers of leadership

Wow this has caused quite a lot of stir for a non issue highkey.

I'm sorry y'all, but it's a logo. This is not that big of a deal lol.

Your tuition money at work. I’d love to know how much they spent on this. Looks like it was made in 5 minutes. Lmao

Can someone say Fiverr?

What’s the email subject?

It’s like they don’t even try. They paid half a million for the new logo alone, not even counting the estimated >5 million for the actual rebranding. I suck at design, but even I could have created a better (and cheaper) logo.

When I worked at Nordstrom right after I graduated from GMU, I sold Scalia some underwear and helped him get his pants from alterations and try them on to ensure that they fit. So any Scalia-related ASSLAW hurts me personally on a deep level because I have in fact had to worry about that man's ass at one point in my life.

Not just ASS. ASS LAW 🤣

at least that one I assumed they got paid off for. no one paid for them to change their logo.

I disagree, I think this issue is a perfect example of how disconnected our leadership is to student issues. Student happiness is astronomically low for a reason.

But the 500k price tag is a big deal. so it the 5 mil price tag on the actual rebranding process. you might not care where your tuition money goes but i do, especially considering that they are raising tuition and cutting funding from many departments at the school.

Reminds me of the [Ryan Gosling SNL sketch](https://youtu.be/jVhlJNJopOQ?si=PF67Yy14weIle5oV)

"Our journey to modernize George Mason University's brand identity"

So is a half a million or ten million. I'm seeing different things tossed around and just curious

In what way? It’s a fucking change to the logo.

Oh damn 500k? Yeah I guess that's massive but that is what a rebranding deal does. I get both sides but for sure it doesn't look great. Honestly though I feel like if it was a good logo people would still be up in arms about it.

What a joke

So they paid 500k for the new logo, and its going to take them another 5mil to actually implement the change i.e. new signs, tshirts, office rebranding, etc

There is no possible way the spent 10 million on a new logo design. Even $500k seems outlandish. I work for a public entity that is also in the process of rebranding and a new logo shouldn't cost them more than $50k

You're missing the entire point. They're rebranding the entire school. In their [blog post](https://www.gmu.edu/news/2024-04/george-mason-university-completes-long-term-rebrand-new-logo), they stated that they'll be moving away from "Mason" and "GMU", despite those being the two most common names for this school. If you look at this subreddit name, there's a reason it's named GMU, not George Mason....because we know this school as Mason/GMU. As pointed out by u/jayebird1012, this just further demonstrates the school administration's disconnect from our wants, because this rename is 100% not what we wanted. Also, let's not get into the fact that GM overlaps with General Motors. That by itself should be a reason not to change to this new logo.

The logo is THE symbol of the university. It might not really impact you, but our school is spending millions of our tuition money to enact this huge change that is super unpopular with the students. Again, a change to the logo isn’t necessarily bad, it’s the misuse of funds and the fact that they didn’t consult the student body that makes it wrong.

And in the email they called that “budget neutral.”

Where sauce?

If they had all the signs remade already…I could see being $10M easy.

Oh no, change that doesn’t affect anything in the day to day lives of anyone. God why worry about more pressing issues in the world when changing the name of a school means all the students are depressed

Can you please show me the budget for the change

Btw it was 500k according to another redditor, but at least you can feel important and you can feel like your making a change

Read the original comment again. We are talking about a logo design cost. Not the cost to replace every sign. Very big difference.

You're a joy to be around, I'm sure.

500k for the new logos (which use arial font btw 😂) and they plan to spend upwards of 5 mil on the actual rebranding. tf r u yapping about buddy

To be fair. $500K for that logo is a fucking disgrace.

Yes because I can find the fun things in life instead of harping on stupid shit that doesn’t matter. It’s the little things in life, like poking fun of people on Reddit

Email 2 hours before class: "Make sure to show up a little early today so you can be paired up in breakout groups" Me: "n o t h a n k y o u"

That's why I always wait one minute after the assigned time

I disconnect whenever that happens.

Lol what. My professors usually just randomly assign the breakout rooms in the middle of class.

This is somehow even more awkward and I love it 😆

Some professors use it for its intended purpose, others treat it as an amazing new way to have the students teach themselves. Even having them in a main instructional room for a single minute to assign breakouts is too much effort, so they gotta show up before class starts. I have a friend at UMW who had a CALCULUS class like that in the Spring. They did pass thanks to the textbook, but just barely.

I was wishing I had my DSLR with me when I left the Art and Design building around 7:10. My iPhone's processing couldn't do it justice.

Yeah this picture barely does justice for how neat it looked across campus. I wish I had more time to walk around and take photos but I was on the way to a class.

Driving back from a shopping trip in Fair Lakes wasn't fun! Was fine enough when I left as long as I stayed below the speed limit, but on the drive back it had gotten so much worse that I literally couldn't see the lines on the road.

You have no room to make remarks regarding my friend's appearance nor his phrasing. Talking about how "women want confidence" yet 2 months ago you were asking for advice and nobody gave you a response. Just cause you're bitter about how you look doesn't mean you should go around running your mouth about how others look. Quit wasting people's time and find something better to do with your own maybe then you wouldn't fail to receive genuinely good advice and can build a genuine relationship with someone instead of whatever weird fantasy you have in mind, invartic don't take anything this guy says seriously. ![gif](giphy|CoDp6NnSmItoY)

wait till i get my freak on

Be like Chris Evan’s the actor. And you will see women come to u.

Females want confidence. They want a man that does has a handsome profile picture instead of a bathroom. They want a man that can speak properly. They want a man that listens to them. They want a man that’s funny.

....I want a man whose profile picture is a goofy cat photo. Preferably one who doesn't say "females" like they're viewing creatures under a microscope haha

Uhhh, can you not call them "females"?

not you then?

reddit moment

People with the least amount of game always have the most to say about it.

Bro is nonchalant

If it was born on campus and people are a normal sight for it, it probably has little reason to be particularly afraid. The squirrels aren't. The way it is moving does not look like rabies, we had to deal with a rabid coyote on our property once and you could clearly see that there was something really wrong. This guy just looks like he is enjoying a morning walk across campus.

Saw one of them chilling near the JC a week or two ago, with a crowd filming.

so many animals running free at mason! saw a fawn just a couple days ago near the parking lot.

forest puppy

Hey I saw that too! Lol

The fact that it bee-lined behind the bike rack makes me think it's probably fine. It looked for cover and took what was closest at hand. Possibly got spooked by something and flushed out of wherever it had been hiding. Also looks a little small--probably this year's pup, so 8-10 months old. So maybe hasn't learned to be super stealth yet. Another disease that's more common than rabies in these guys (in this area at least) is mange. Mange can make them appear less fearful of humans because it affects their ability to hunt and starving animals get desperate. Thankfully, this little dude has a nice coat, so I doubt it's mangy. Just young and habituated.

Low key, is it normal for foxes to be this normal around people? They’re usually so skittish. It looks healthy and well fed so I’m not worried about it being sick.

He was running around the bridge at 850 this morning. Doesn't seem afraid of people much.

That's literally so cute lol 😭💖

Fox don't GAF! "students, meh... simply in my way as I - ooh! really interesting smell in this garden..." (edit: stupid typo)

The foxes are like celebrities to us at this point I see so many posts love the little guy and or guys

I stg that’s the same fox I saw when I came to GMU for a hackathon!!

I’ve seen foxes all around on my night walks, especially smaller ones (probably babies)

I like foxes but I think it should be relocated. There are too many big roads near the school for it to get hit. Hope they put it in some sanctuary or wildlife refuge place

I agree w/ u

There has been a bit of research in the past few years into the phenomenon of foxes beginning to “self-domesticate” so it’s possible it’s simply learned humans equal food. Unless it’s acting suspiciously in other ways (“zombie-like”, stumbling, disoriented), I would assume that’s what’s going on. But it’s always a good idea to assume an animal is sick and be careful, not to mention the fact that a lot of people hunt them, so it’s best not to make them blindly trust people.

I'm worried about it being sick. It should not be that nonchalant. It might be in the early stages of rabies. Stay away from it.

That would be stupid you’d be taking them out of the ecosystem by doing that. There’s 4-5 that live around here and do just fine

Fairfax is teaming with foxes. It would be like relocating raccoons and squirrels.

That’s what I was wondering but I know next to nothing about rabies. I was unaware there’d be an “early stage” of rabies? But that makes sense.

This is the post that's making me wary, he feels a bit too unconcerned around people

Most likely your right, there’s a tiny bit of me that’s hoping that it’s just a weirdly calm fox. Hopefully admin can take care of it.

..... we have racoons?

As someone who had to get a course of rabies shots due to - I am not making this up - a racoon jumping up 1/2 on my lap like a dog begging for treats (and then biting me when I had none)... I can attest to the fact that these dudes are just getting Supes comfortable w/humanity. We've taken over their habitat and the most adaptable are figuring out new tactics for survival.

They're out late at night on campus sometimes

Have a great summer break, everyone!

What it feels like receiving updates on Fall 2020 from Mason

I don't even know if I should submit my housing deposit and I am a freshman.

Literally laughed out loud at this. Thank you.

Honestly considering a gap year at this point 😪

Make sure you’re aware of it or how that affects your student loans if you already have any! I know if you drop below half time you can start having to pay, I don’t know how an official leave of absence affects that though.

I didn’t even think about that. Thanks for the heads-up

Of course! It’s certainly unprecedented times so there might be allowances made because of the circumstances but it’s a federal regulation from my understanding. The registrar’s office and financial aid would have the answers though.

What the actual fuck It’s one thing to stand outside and protest against abortion, but I don’t wanna see essentially gore content 😭

They've been doing this crap since I went to Mason way back in 2011. I still can't believe they aren't violating some kind of obscenity regulations.

Man they still do this? I graduated back in 2012 and remember seeing this.

I remember my very first week of freshman year (like August of 2018) anti-abortion activists had covered like the entirety of Wilkins Plaza with massive banners and posters showing bloody fetuses and dismembered body parts Made for an interesting start to my college years

JMU BA + MA alum, GMU 4th year PhD student here.... don't give in to the rage bait.

Irl ragebait

Slap some Palestinian or Antifa flag stickers on their signs and they'll get yanked right away.

Why is it always men talking about what women should do with their bodies..Child please.

Their leader got put in prison for a decade for blocking access to an abortion clinic and various other crimes. Can't wait until the others get arrested.

I don’t understand how this stuff is allowed on campus

Just ignore them. They want attention. Don’t engage them at all.

Years ago, Loudoun had a representative named Dick Black who came to our high schools to say don’t smoosh and don’t sin and here’s a toy baby that represents the baby you will lose in a termination. I loved when they’d print his name backwards to announce him.

“Createdequal” as long as you buy into our dogma and do everything we tell you

Where is this so i can avoid this shit

I was sitting nearby with noise cancelling headphones and someone from the group came up and tapped my shoulder to try and talk to me and scared the shit out of me. what even is the goal? do they think they are changing peoples minds by being here??

Ahh yes saw that in 2021, same big traffic sign too lol

God these people are annoying

Think we could train the lanternflies to swarm these people?

Ya I saw it when I was going to southside made me loose my appetite.

I love the goreposting right next to the sign offering counseling. Like shooting someone and then saying you know a totally licensed doctor. I talked to them for a while and they're a mix of stupid and genuinely evil. The old white dude was the evil one, no surprises there lmao

Damnit, not this again. They've done this before, for years, and student government I don't try to do something about it, but I don't think it worked out. The only legally actionable advice I can give you is to ignore them. There are other legal actions, but I do not condone them.

There used to be a bus covered in this stuff that drove all over in DC.

I'm not going to a school with this. There are plenty of universities who enforce no-touch policies (prevents the tapping on the shoulder or approach) and content-neutral restrictions which disallow ALL megaphones, gory images and other rallying in designated areas within certain feet of classroom buildings. What students should do: 1. REPORT any physical contact. Even just tapping on the shoulder. I know its a joke out there about assault, but assault is ANY unwanted touching, even if its just a pat on the back. Following counts under other laws and should also be reported. 2. Contact your admin to see permits or request info on amplified noise protocols. 3. if this truly is distracting or causing issues, report it. If enough students do, they won't kick groups like this off campus but they will tighten the rules around it which is better for everyone, regardless of group. Everyone has to be held to the same standard, whether BLM, anti-abortion or pro-pink crayon demonstration.

If I were pregnant after having an abortion I would pretty be upset.

Imagine having the time to do shit like this lol and choosing to spend it this way…

This happened at VCU a few days back too

I am anti abortion but 99% abortions are not like this at all, and this is insane that people are allowed to show this level of gore

they’ve (maybe not the same group, i don’t know) done this in front of K-12 schools too. had a day in my junior year of high school where they were at the perimeter of the school grounds with those signs. and then they went to the nearby middle and elementary schools. sick shit

Unfortunately we have to remember that colleges are typically the breeding ground for free speech

Don’t want to see it, but very glad to support it

Back in ‘03, they had a lot more signs.

The one thing I actually got GMU to make them stop doing was riding around big tricycles with huge gore/whatever posters hitched to them all over campus instead of staying in their assigned spot that they pay the school for by the hour. ETA: yeah there were huge posters and megaphones on the tricycles I accidentally made it sound like they were just riding tricycles LOL

Yup, my freshman semester was Fall 2018 and it was like this then. And I think even then it had been going on quite a while.

Exactly. They want college kids to get mad at them or attack them to try and prove a point. If we all ignored them and went about our day they would be a lot more quiet.

You’re right, should I take this post down?

That has to be considered some sort of child abuse or labor law violation

I don't think the men care what women do with their bodies. They see the unborn baby as it's own body deserving it's own human rights

I flicked one of them off once. Not my normal personality but also. Stop telling me what to do with my body.

They thrive off of attention and policing women on what to do with their bodies. Probably won’t stop until it’s completely banned everywhere.

How to avoid telling people my major (computer science) When people ask me what my major and school is, I'm hesitant to say. It's probably rare for them to be graced with the presence of a student at the top cs/engineering school in the U.S., the MIT of Fairfax County. Especially a computer science major, the most prestigious program at said school. I feel a bit guilty, as meeting someone so much more accomplished, yet their same age, probably crushes their self image. How do you guys go about avoiding the question, or what other major do you usually say?

I think I’d be too busy enjoying the smell of my own farts than to respond to such peasantry

They know you are in computer science from miles away

Way to steal this post from other schools’ subreddits. To steal the top comment: your body odor tells them before you get the chance to.

Don’t worry people don’t need to inquire about your major. Your unwashed scent precedes you, telling them everything they need to know. Also you haven’t accomplished anything until you get a job, so shut up and go back the the dank pit you game in instead of studying.

From the smell

I'm offended

It’s a joke. 👍

So is my nose

oh well uh mb

Well, I kinda feel you tbh, our amphitheater smells like shit. We are 400 people, no windows, 5 A/Cs (thank god), and if a single person hasn't had a shower I suffer for the whole class.

Saw these tweets & couldn't relate more

Man the discussion board. It’s always “read this and then post a response by Thursday. Then by Sunday respond to two of your classmates”. And the responses are just “I totally agree with everything you just said!” and they just basically say what you just said but worded differently lmfao.

There are teachers that know what they are doing, and teachers that don't. Unfortunately so far this year my teachers are either not even trying to use blackboard (1 has emailed everything) or their blackboards are confusing as fuck. It really is becoming a problem. I am constantly postitive I am missing information or assignments...

It’s the “asynchronous” classes that apparently have synchronous assignments that don’t clearly state that aside from some small text in the syllabus that nobody read that causes it for me. My professor literally had to push the due date of an assignment from 1:45 today to the end of the day because NOBODY knew an asynchronous class would have a set time and date to do assignments when a class meeting time is not scheduled on patriotweb.

This is how I felt before online classes too

They really need to lock the customization in blackboard so that professors don’t put the assignments and collaborate and everything everywhere.

I felt this real hard. This semester actually fees harder than a regular semester ngl

it’s all making me even more stressed out

on top of that I have to set my own schedule for most of my lectures smh

I’m glad I’m not the only ones. He class the blackboards are mess and I’m constantly stressed with assignments and due dates that I could be missing popping up

Whew chile the ACCURACY. Got me checking the modules, discussion boards, small group discussions, and syllabus multiple times for my 5 classes. My first semester taking this many courses too. The stress is real lmao

bruh just put the assignments on blackboard I’m tired of downloading the syllabus 15 times just to read the calendar 😭

Yes!! I have been feeling so stressed out and overwhelmed! I feel like I deff bit off more than I could chew taking 6 online classes this semester 🥴.

I always feel like there’s something due hidden in the nooks and crannies of the class page. And more often than not, there is, so I’m just checking the whole site everyday now...

This was me for the past week

I have one class that still has all the discussion board posts up from spring semester, and the professor hasn't sent a single announcement out to the class now at the end of the 2nd week of the semester. H e l p.

Every course is an adventure through the blackboard pages...

Blackboard is *such* a shitty service. I don’t know why it doesn’t have two absolutely basic features: (1) An option to email the student when a grade is posted. It emails you *the moment you submit an assignment* yet it can’t email you *when that same assignment is graded?* Why the fuck not?! (2) An “Activity” pane that shows every single meaningful event in the class. It’s perfectly fine to break it up into categories like Lectures, Assignments, Grades, etc., but there needs to be one place you can go to see *everything* so you don’t spend 15 minutes searching every section for that one thing the instructor uploaded *somewhere*. Both of these are incredibly basic, essential features that Blackboard has not offered for years. It’s mind-bogglingly bad software.

I have an asynchronous class that has quizzes and exams at certain time only🙃

Don't forget the one about online be classes being is payed Khan academy. Seriously some of the pre recorded lectures are bad.

It's nice being a grad student, just one class at a time lol. I can imagine the stress though of taking a full undergrad schedule.

IT 214 was the worst culprit for this. Assignments were in course content, then the week, then the chapter, then the section, then on the last slide of that particular sections slide. So for one chapter yoh could have 7 sections and 7 different 4 slide powerpoints with questions in each of them. I manually stitched each slide together because there were too many variables and i could easily miss a question. Of course when you turn in a homework, everything has to be neat, in order, and easily gradeable. One of the many reasons I don't feel like this school gives a shit about me or students.

Lol I hate my professors for requiring each reply to be at least 100 words 😒😒

English 302 baby

OML that’s my theater class :(((

I understood that asynchronous only meant no meet times (independent of assignment due dates) but also I have the blackboard app on my phone so I have a notification any time anything is due. If you don’t have the app and you don’t memorize the syllabus it’s confusing af though

It was already a bit like this but online increased it 10 fold

This would help so much and I don’t understand why they haven’t done it yet

I have mine printed out but for some reason I feel like my professor may update the due dates without telling us, so I still keep downloading all the syllabi lol

Lmfao this is literally me. I have the same syllabus downloaded so many times

Ikr, the classes are so fragmented

If i was in that class my replies would be like "I agree with your statement. I think it was said very well. If I had to give one piece of criticism, Id say it's just really good, maybe too good. I think your statement is very good and well analyzed. Also has very good spelling."

Still missing 55 words tho! Lol

Desi weddings in general

Don't be like this There were empty trash cans just barely further away...

this is why we’re #1 in innovation🔥

Reason 3001 of why people hate on GMU

people at this school have no morals. classless

I'm just impressed by that one bag on top, I wanna know what went through that person's mind before placing that on top

Looks like there needs to be another trash can.

My bad I was really hungry

what the flip

Yoooooo that's rank.

Monkey see monkey do

Dont fail education like this people. We all need to be responsible. You should be a better representative of GMU.

Then empty the trashcan.

Either need more bins or more staff

Especially with that homophobic chit.

Funny enough, I just put my food on that trash specifically like 2 days ago, although it was like very hot, lol.

How about do your job and take out the trash. This isn't the customer's fault.

Hey. At least they are considering changing the name of the university because he used to own slaves.

They could have used the other trash cans, Fair enough. But it shouldn't have ever gotten to that point. Just take out the trash....

I thought I was escaping the chick fli a feins

Or have someone empty the trash… I would be like…. Where is my fucking tuition money going??? If everyone there is paying 30k+ a year to go there. The university can pay someone to empty the trash every 5 minutes…. FOREVER

I had to down vote to keep on 69 sorry

I'm sorry but I have to make this joke: I'm your 69th upvote

Let’s keep the votes on 69

I'm telling you dude, College is exactly like High School, but way bigger 😂

I wouldn’t expect them to have morals at the Raytheon pipeline

What you just take it with you or I’m assuming it’s not the only can that’s looks like that cuz that wouldn’t make much sense

Not a damn thing

I can smell the entitlement.

Very clever, hm?

So you didn’t have a good time in high school?

I’m assuming all the other cans are similarly full, so what should they do? Leave it on the tables? This seems fine, they tried to put it where the trash goes. The worker will just pull out a second bag and put the overflow in and then get the rest of the full can.

I can smell a slacker.

I said in the post that there were empty cans nearby 💀 The issue is people not wanting to spend 30 extra seconds to be considerate

Easy. They should take the trash with them until they can properly deposit it in another, emptier can.

You slacking on taking the extra steps to just dump your garbage in an empty bin. Lol

It’s behind exploratory hall I think

Congratulations to the GMU graduating class of 2022!

Thank you :) too bad I just bombed my 455 exam. Bouta be at Mason one more semester

Thanks bro needed this

Aight I don’t need to walk on Friday, this was good enough.

Flurry at the end of the round LETS GOOO

I see cockatiel and mason I smile

Idk which 455 you took but STAT455 screwed me over my last sem so :,,,,,,,)

It's Pomp and Circumstance

I DID! C+ as my final grade LETS GET ITTTT

Honestly sounds like music from Animal Crossing, that’s how wholesome it is

Bedtime for robot :))

Sleep tight little fella

He wakes. He works for the sweat and toil of his capitalist human. He sees students walking to class or lunch and says “I could do that one day” - but he cannot, as he is a robot. He constantly desires free mobility, but his programming forces him along a fixed path. He delivers the goods, sleeps, and the same hell awaits him the next day. Battery fully. Battery empty. Battery full. Day in and day out.

I have never noticed this before, where is this?

Little marshmallow babeh

I miss being on campus so much watching these little guys pass me by. Fall '21 is going to be a breath of fresh air!

Capitalism is when robot 😭😭😡😡

It’s by the JC.

There are some behind Ike’s too I think

Paying tuition like...

Pay directly from your bank account if possible that will save you 300+ dollars

*cries in out of state tuition*

Bro it is very wack. However, a lot of other colleges have it worse. For example, VT tuition is a little over double of GMU yearly. And then Ivy leagues like Cornell tuition is $76k per year with no aid.

Pay with your e-Check to avoid the credit card payment fee

Investment for your future.

GMU is one of the cheapest and best value colleges in Virginia and the USA can’t really complain

Unless you have a CC that can give you a percentage that surpasses the fee. CC with 5% PayPal, for example.

\*shudders\* *graduate out of state tuition*

What made you decide to come to a no-campus-life commuter school from out of state?

lmao, I came here to say this.

Where do you go now? I think about transfering out too, but I don't really know any other schools in Virginia. What are some good suggestions?

If you pick a good major lol

Yea I know, Im just tryna add some humor

i can literally only afford to go to a 4 year because of GMU

I want all rightwing captialist pig bootlickers to leave

Yes it is. It also depends when you started school I believe. Like when you start at a certain year, they honor the same tuition. But according to their page, tuition at VT without aid comes out to $27k for 2 semesters.

Hang in there....

Because it’s dumb that college is this expensive in the first place just to keep up with the minimal expectation to get a good job

I agree with you. It is unfortunate that the student fees are the same... however, in terms of value, it’s not bad at all.

You’re a right wing person based on your post history. Funny you say that cause you’re biggest capitalist fan you love buying stuff and you love Milton Friedman he was a famous vegan he actually won a medal for it.

My Discover and Chase run quarterly 5% categories. Sometimes it coincides with tuition. Also, if you just got a new CC and need to spend money to get that bonus, it could be worthwhile.

Nah I did include that

Thankyou for replying back. My two biggest worries about transfering are how many of credits would transfer and if the tuition would be more or less than gmu depending on the location. (Out of state)

Yea its my last class, but the burnout is real.

welcome to the neoliberal capitalist market economy

If you had to read through my profile to dig up enough dirt to sling personal attacks, kinda pathetic isn't it?

It’s a joke

For Discover it was in September. For Chase, it is right now.

Horizon Hall (Robinson) is looking great! Thoughts on the new name?

Should’ve called it starship hall and have a delivery robot themed interior.

Guess closing down for the semester really let them speed things up.

Damn that is nice actually

Shit they built that fast

BRO I HAD NO IDEA IT WAS COMING ALONG THIS FAR

That name is not going to stick. It'll get dedicated to a faculty member or big donater in, my guess, the next 10 years.

Building looks great! Don’t like the name. For me, and according to their explanation, it just seems too on the nose. I dunno.

That building on the left could use a renovation. Let’s hike tuition again. - GMU

I was actually planning of driving over to campus to look at the progress. It really went far. Too bad I won't be here next year to enjoy the new building lol.

"Now arriving at Horizon Lunar Colony..."

That was quick

oh damn, that's progress. prolly still gonna call it robinson out of habit, but i'm liking it.

Probably won't be seeing it any time soon. It's alright but not much I can really say until I see it in person. The name is adequate but we have a Meeting Hall... ...so where TF is our Cabrera Hall

*opening in 2030*

I guess the extra $450 helped huh, jk

Damn, this looks great

Crazy!!! It looks amazing so far. So excited to come back in the fall to be honest.

I think thats what is planned to do next

I graduated in 2018 and I’ll still talk about Robinson and probably refer to the new building as Robinson

The Globe --> Angel Cabrera Global Center

Meeting is supposed to be Merten Hall.

Congrats to the Class of 2019!!🙌🏽🎓🎊🎉

Y’all mf did the damn thing so proud and ready to be you!! One more year

Congratulations!!!

Congratulations!!! 🎊🍾

Congratulations to us! :) And damn you were behind me. 🥰🥰🥰

Well done fellas

Well done, folks

Congratulations!!!

Aaa the Pakistani flag

Thank you so much, the grind was definitely hard 🙌🏽

On behalf of us who Graduated Thank You!

Let’s cherish and enjoy this moment 🙌🏽👏🏽🎊

But totally worth it! Go get that bAAAAG!!!!!!!!!

THIS IS AN MLM SCAM. This “company” is a part of Vector Marketing. They target students who are in need of money and bring them in to sell overpriced knife sets to their friends and family.

If you see one of those cards purposely scattered all over, toss 'em. Not only are they litter, they're a total scam.

If a job posting is extremely vague about what the job actually entails, I'd recommend staying away. Doubly so if the posting talks about a higher than average pay rate or flexible hours. If the job requires you to pay them money to start - for a set of knives, as an example - stay away.

Shit like this should be banned from campus tbh

They're also doing this to local high schoolers. A friend of my coworker almost got sucked in, but I talked him out of it and got him a job where I work instead.

I’d suggest people from this sub ask for a lot of cards (for their friends) and then just walk out of their sight line and recycle them.

Even though this sub has its own share of disagreements and debacles, it's nice to see we can all come together in agreement that vector marketing fucking sucks

Lmao it’s Vector

Omg! I went to an interview with this stupid company and the guy acted like some big shot who really “cared” about me. It was bullshit. Wanted me to drive around and go into peoples homes and talk to them about these knives. Did a demonstration of how great they are (worked like any other sharp knife)... apparently they’ve been doing this for so long that my parents have even heard of it!

When I say Pyramid you say Scheme!

I knew it. this guy handed me this card!! Why is it not banned??

Worked for CutCo. Vector Marketing not long ago. Decent knives and halfway decent benefits. I enjoyed doing the presentations but they were far and few between. You are tasked with setting up your own appointments by building connections with those who you do presentations for. Majority of the time they didn’t want to give out names and numbers of other people (understandably). Which left you with a dead end, which stung even more when they didn’t buy anything. You also do not get paid mileage for the distances you drive, which left me paying for over 100$ in gas which was a little under. 1/3 of my pay check. Remember those benefits I talked about? I bought a set of knives with the block for a little under 700$ because the Regional Manager liked me and gave me a discount. That was about it. Yes it is a scam, and yes it’s a poor job for a High School student. Rant over.

I remember making my dad drive me to an interview for this company 10 years ago, they STILL run this scam? Holy shit...

r/antimlm. these are on campuses everywhere

So true LOL

the guy she told you not worry about

Best meme yet - well done!

Is the actual text part of the logo too? Like it’s not just GM it’s GM George Mason University?

Wow that really is a stupid logo, it’s repetitive. Plus most people I know refer to the school as GMU or George Mason NOT GM. Embarrassing logo honestly we have to list the school TWICE.

GMU students right now

Don't forget most college students didn't receive any stimulus checks

I just think of it this way: We’re losing a shit ton of money in this pandemic, and so is Mason and every other college in the country. Everyone everywhere is struggling and I honestly can’t hate on the university that much, I’m much more pissed at the anti-maskers, antivaxxers, and the government’s response to this shit. We could’ve had a normal semester if it wasn’t for these fucks.

*Spending millions to build a monument to slaves who died 200 years ago

Isn't there some kind of covid benefit thing you can apply for though? Specifically for students, I mean...

We could’ve had a normal anything if these fucks didn’t mold the virus to promote political agendas.

Many countries around the world recommend NOT using masks. Because, while there's no proof that masks don't work there's no proof that masks work either. There's proof that masks work in a controlled environment, but there's no evidence outside of that. There's several issues and benefits to masks, and there's no study accurately and empirically proving their effectiveness: 1) Masks cause more people to touch their face, they then get the virus on their hands and proceed to touch other objects 2) Masks provide SOME protection against droplets and virions entering the air, meaning they're effective if the people with the virus follow proper precautions (huge if) 3) Masks make people bold, working against social distancing 4) Masks make it harder to talk loud, so people need to get closer to communicate, also working against social distancing. All the "evidence" you hear about on news are highly politicized messages, where the "evidence" is either gathered in a controlled environment, or it's a mathematical prediciton model (which has proven wrong on every turn this pandemic) I just hate how the journalists are incompitent enough to fail to question all the governments bullshitting. Not just when it comes to masks, but everything in general. Long story short, don't think yourself all so wise by using masks. I use them myself due to government regulations, but I'm very sceptical about them actually achieving anything. You could be right or you could be wrong, so stop victimizing yourself and calling out everyone who disagrees with you. Your opinion is perfectly valid, I'm not saying that it isn't, but you should have some scepticism. Why is it that you hate how the American government has handled this pandemic, yet you blindly trust them that masks work, when it runs contrary to the common consensus in Europe? Edit: If any of you downvoting lurkers out there disagree, at least participate by referencing a study. Downvoting me doesn't prove me wrong. I'm willing to admit to being wrong if you can find some good studies proving me wrong, I don't stubbornly stick to opinions for no good reason. (Preferrably a study that isn't funded by someone with a bias) There're first-world countries that don't recommend masks, ie. the scandinavian countries, they do this for a reason. I'm not saying that masks don't help, but that there's a lack of undisputable evidence that they do. There's nobody that's properly informed on the issue that disagree with that. Here's a pretty decent article on it, albeit a little out-dated: https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.bbc.com/news/amp/world-52015486

Covid student fund, yeah Mason has it

Huh. How to apply?

Lol at the downvotes because you said the left is bad

I’m not sure what the requirements are. I just saw it on the Business Blog, but here’s the link [COVID-19 Student Emergency Assistance Funding](https://ulife.gmu.edu/student-emergency-assistance-funding/)

Hey man i didn’t downvote you but i just wanna say its my *strong* opinion that a certain one person in power had the chance to keep this threat at bay a really long time ago, but failed to do so to serve the interests of certain entities whose values don’t quite align with the values of the working class.

He shit on the right wing too but reading is hard apparently

This is only for summer, they have not made many plans for fall 2020

I'm just assuming the SJW didnt make it that far

Sure ya did, bud, sure ya did.

I photoshopped the logo in the Mason Pond, what do you think?

Could you photoshop it at the bottom of the lake? Lol

Where it belongs

You guys need help. Please don’t litter in the pond, especially with that kind of filth.

A landfill seems more fitting

Best place for it

Now let it sink

Is this a university or a car dealership?

If I knew how deep it was and could see the bottom.

I also think it’s funnier to imagine it floating around for all to see.

We will take any credit score, trust me

It's shallow enough to wade in it iirc. It only reaches your middle shins

I am curious. Did you actually cross it? or saw someone?

I saw a friend of a friend take a dip during spring 2022, got caught by campus police, and he had to take a blackboard class for how to behave lmfao. Those classes sucked too. It was like corporate style training modules

Didn't someone drown in it trying to do just this?

Lol.. would have thought a fair warning would do it, but to take behavioral class for just a dip is pretty ridiculous and funny

I know you can drown in a bathtub but you'd have to really screw up to drown in the Mason pond. I've watched people walk/swim across is around graduation time and wasn't above their shoulders. I'd be very surprised if it was more than 5 feet deep at any point.

Yeah during the covid years we're insaneeeee. Hell I had to take a behavior class because I took my mask down to sip water in the kitchen room of Taylor hall. One of the RA's everyone hated during that academic year wrote everyone up for the stupidest things

Haha.. sorry that happened to you. It's petty of them to do corrective action for such small matters. I myself have come across such jerks at gmu

It's all good it was two years ago now. People, like that RA, will go on power trips when given the opportunity. Not your fault that happened either and sorry you've had a similar experience

Me looking for an open class last minute at the end of the semester

Why is this so accurate

It's like your looking in a mirror

Especially in upper level courses

i love 400 classes I swear 200 and 100 (sometimes 300) will have the strictest rules that I have ever seen then I’ll walk into my 400 class for my last spring semester here and it’s this AND you get off early ☺️ shoutout to this professor

The lower level classes are meant to weed people out, the higher level courses are for those who have demonstrated they have what it takes to complete their degree

At least from when I was as doing my degree, a lot of 400 level classes are specialized, rather than teaching fundamentals and basics like the lower level. Usually class sizes are smaller, and you got a lot of professors who are heavily invested in and actually love the subject material rather than just teaching generic core subjects. It just feels like the environment is way more exciting and interactive as a result.

Seriously though, if you are sick, STAY AWAY. It's sad professors need to spell it out in the syllabus/first lecture.

Honestly real

For me who just went to mine today to find out no notes will be posted for the semester and 15% of total grade is attendance, it's gonna be more like "Sick? Well we're all in this together"

W professor 😂

Yeah Jeffery is great. I’m taking him this semester too

hell yeah 👍

Organic Chem is a prime example

At least for me in cs the 400 level classes are starting to be the only interesting ones.

Yeah they clearly aren’t IT majors!

Thermo and fluid mechanics were the big ones for my program

For CS your first 3 classes are literally learning the same concepts in three different languages. An absolute waste of time IMO. I get that they want you to work with languages with different levels of abstractions (i.e. memory) but if they made 211 in C and 112 in Python, students would get a much better picture of memory and abstraction, plus data structures in 310 fundamentally make so much more sense

Just unsubscribe from the emails.

Do people actually buy from them? Prices are so gouged

They are so annoying

I set a rule to filter my inbox freshman year and have forgotten about them aside from occasional reddit posts

Bro you’re in cyse, don’t you know how email works ?

I have now learned from your comments that I can unsubscribe from these emails. Thank you.

GMU Bookstore - $200. Amazon ebook - $45. Class requires their online book to do homework - $190. Fuck!

I’ve unsubscribed thrice now and I still get emails. Now I just filter them and they go to another inbox and then gets deleted

Meanwhile free pdf files looking from around the corner like 👉👈

Set up email rules to automatically filter to another folder. I did that for those daily Covid check emails, bookstore, and other clutter.

Name 10 books

This is what I did.... my email has never looked so clean

I had a few teachers that exclusived with them unfortunately

My professor always upload stuff on BB AT 11:59 PM AND it's like 15-20 docs. Like 15-20 notification individually

Those teachers getting a cut or published the books

Yeah they published them, that's what I meant by they exclusived with them - they put them there

so annoying

2fa annoying, but not as bad as having to change your password every 6 months.

Bad news y’all, most companies do this lol. It’s also totally worth it. I was our company's Duo administrator for a period. They're a market leader behind okta, they're not nearly the worst option.

Remember me for 14 days

sEnD mE A PUSh

Damn bro that’s crazy

Definitely thought this during the whole first year I was at Mason.

Say less my g

Kind of miss the days where you had to put in your whole G# and a special PIN to log in. I still have my G# memorized for this reason.

Aah tss push it

Listen to Salt N Peppa and push it.

It's La Push bb.

Password requirements have gotten so bad these past few years. Your password must be 8-32 characters, it also can use only these specific special characters, it must use a capital letter, and you cannot reuse an old password. I literally have like 10 variants of a single password across various services

...my company requires changing passwords every 3 months. All passwords. Get ready.

Sorry you have to enable cookies for that

Just use a password manager. All my passwords are random, 20 character long garbage

If I give you cookies, will you wemember me wuwu?

I can give you more than an UwU for a cookie 😉

I have a tin of home made cookies on my desk right nowuw. ...

Just submitted my last final of the semester... Best of luck to everyone. If I can do it, you can!

My finals haven't even started yet

I wish I was done for the semester

I have 2/5 done 😭

Meanwhile us NVCC students still have a week. Can I can an F in the chat

I took my last final last night! Breathed a HUGE sigh of relief too 😂 we made it!!!

I have 2/6 done

That picture reminds me of this super weird spongbob video just posted by Meatcanyon on youtube.

My profs decided to have theirs due BEFORE exam week... And they gave us the files a month in advance. I've had final exam anxiety since the beginning of November.

All 5 of my finals are due in between Wednesday 1:00 pm to Friday 11:59

That's nice. Some of my professors give us a week to do it which is really considerate of them.

Both classes were pretty major projects. One was a complete analysis of a suspect malicious binary (not only monitoring it running but decompilation and analysis of specific functionality), with a 5 to 10 page paper summarizing the analysis. The second was a full-on attack of a VM, installation of a web shell, and exploitation of the box while not triggering the web application firewall installed. In both cases, is was the equivalent of all the work from the four homework assignments from the semester as a capstone project.

Mason keeps misleading and endangering us, here's some fast facts:

Somebody please remind me why the heck GMU being the largest university in Virginia contracted with a new and shady company that popped out of nowhere for an emergency that involves the life of students, faculty and a good chunk of Fairfax county

Good thing I swabbed my dog Instead

Is the student body allowed to take any legal action?

Fuck Mason me and all my homies hate Mason

Who owns Kallaco? Who are they friends with? Seriously, some journalism student is gonna come out with a pulizter prize if they follow the money. Hint hint fucking hint

It’s probably cause VCU and William and Mary also contracted with them.

Generally speaking you have to have standing to sue - you have to be an injured party. Individual students who had to take Kallaco tests would have the most standing to sue, while anyone who’s been on campus could theoretically have some standing if they were to test positive

Here’s a list of sources, a couple things to note. The statement from ThermoFisher isn’t included - was a direct statement to me and I’ll get it out pretty soon. Opteo’s business registration is to the same address that Kallaco lists on the contract (and online on its privacy policy), but the lab address for CLIA is at a building that leases out lab space. CDC test guidelines - https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/lab/guidelines-clinical-specimens.html FDA EUA email - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lJttIV6fDHUGRFm44-wIH85LGLWee1ei/view FDA FURO email - https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vTN8yg9D4z0zDDtxfvByVPCG8iD3LP3MEEdbNgBgvM7QzvX07oKhYG93PvA-KYNZZDSdMua0C_2RV_s/pub FDA inaccurate test - https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/letters-health-care-providers/risk-inaccurate-results-thermo-fisher-scientific-taqpath-covid-19-combo-kit-letter-clinical Opteo email - https://twitter.com/aaupmason/status/1296801886184628224?s=21 Kallaco & Opteo registrations - https://imgur.com/a/Ml9USe4 CLIA types - https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Legislation/CLIA/Downloads/HowObtainCLIACertificate.pdf

Now I wonder why three of the biggest and most important universities of Virginia did that decision. Oh well, time will tell

#Gregory Washington has entered the chat

Couldn’t GMU just make the argument that the person who tested positive got it from someone outside of campus? Like from a store or restaurant. They would need to be able to prove it was Mason’s fault to sue. It kind of seems like the only reason they’re cutting corners is because they will likely never face any repercussions.

The registration information for Kallaco resolves to a residential neighborhood in New Orleans, it is also designated as the Principle Business Office. Kallaco was previously (changed 7/7/2020) Strataclear Solutions LLC. The Registration Domicile Address resolves to 1209 Orange Street, Wilmington, Delaware. This is the the same address as the Corporation Trust Company and that address has thousands of companies registered to the same address, due to Delaware's laws regarding incorporation and state taxes. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation\_Trust\_Center\_(CT\_Corporation)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation_Trust_Center_(CT_Corporation)) I am extremely interested in the Board Members and their likely connections to Mason...

The only reason is to save money. Doing in campus testing is more expensive

They could, that’s why it’s really up to lawyers and judges. Contact tracing should be able to identify, to some extent, where and when the person was exposed (especially now with the new VA COVID tracing app). With Kallaco tests (which they’ve now run out of) the results aren’t reported to VDH. According to a former VDH case investigator who spoke to a partner at another college, VDH only accepts results for FDA approved nasopharyngeal swan tests - so VDH doesn’t accept Kallaco test results. VDH can’t contact trace cases who aren’t reported to them - so any positive Kallaco tests wouldn’t be traced in the first place. Essentially it’d be hard to prove exposure on campus unless you received an approved test and were properly contact traced. So technically the positives reported through Kallaco testing never even were true positives in the eye of the state.

One of the quirks of business law is that business registrations are for the registered agent - who by law typically only has to accept legal service. So registered office typically /= actual office. Some states (ahem LA and DE) also make it difficult by not showing members of a company. One case is my company: I’m the registered agent and the registered office is my house, but the business office is another member’s house, meanwhile (bc it’s Texas) all members are listed publicly. It definitely would be interesting to see who the members of the LLC are, but the way DE works the only way we’d possibly know is through an investigation by the state. Two newer things that might get their own post: Kallaco’s Chief Science Advisor (preciously Chief Science Officer) is the CSO for Opteo - this breaks down further the idea that Opteo is third party. Kallaco is also violating Virginia law. Their HIPPA privacy office is in Glen Allen, which is considered transacting business in the state, and the law requires registration with the VA SCC before transacting business - but they’re not registered.

i suggest looking even more closely at VCU. From the documents released in the William and Mary story, it's clear that William and Mary had planned to contract out testing to VCUHS, then VCU said it could not provide it but had a brand new contractor to offer. I believe the contracting order goes VCU, then W&M, then GMU. Each gets a Sole Source contract one day before they put in a request for sole source authorization. It seems plausible that both W&M and GMU were relying on representations made by VCU. President Rao's statements also make it very unclear how much distance there is between Kallaco and VCUHS. See [http://flathatnews.com/2020/08/26/students-staff-ramp-up-concerns-over-kallaco-testing-protocols/](http://flathatnews.com/2020/08/26/students-staff-ramp-up-concerns-over-kallaco-testing-protocols/)

It was a sole source procurement. There probably weren't that many entities that could fulfill the order in a specific time frame and price point. Due diligence should have be done to check into the company. Issues were probably compounded by the fact FDA relaxed many regulations as well, since pandemic, and allowed companies like these to have a ground to stand.

In March, state agencies were authorized to bypass the standard procurement process after the Governor’s emergency declaration - but still had to seek competition to the max extent practicable. According to the emails sent out by Mason, no other company could do it at the price and speed. In the FFX Times article (linked on our twitter @oversightgmu) it was said that Kallaco was $200-300k cheaper than One Medical. A severe underbid like that should raise immediate questions - the base value of the contract being $156k and an additional potential value of $490k (for a total of nearly $650k), a price difference of half the total potential value should raise questions. Also LabCorp holds a mandatory source contract for lab services with the state (why student health uses them) dating to 2017, COVID testing was added in May to the contract (but in theory it’s not mandatory since procurement procedures were lifted). LabCorp’s price is $51 per test - compared to the base cost for Kallaco of $79. Added costs include shipping and physician review for $16 bringing it to $95 with Kallaco, let’s assume similar making LabCorp $67 - this makes LabCorp cheaper by $126k on tests alone. They also say companies couldn’t test at the same level as Kallaco, but LabCorp specifically offers testing for universities and has a capacity of 130k tests per day - we only needed 4500 total

What's your background? I like the due diligence you provided.

Now I wonder about the competency of Mason's procurement department even more. Not only they gave us a bad solution, but an expensive one. As someone said before, maybe Kallaco "knew somebody"

I’m just a regular student, no special background or anything. Some things that Oversight has put out are from what AAUP has found, some of it from what I’ve found. Can’t speak to how AAUP has done it, but for me it’s just reading docs and coming across something unexpectedly (like the clause that indemnified Kallaco for test accuracy - that’s right the tests didn’t have to be accurate) or having a random hunch and going down the rabbit hole.

I meant major.

But I see it now on that label lol.

Conflict resolution, minor in intel

Don’t be an asshole, put your food away Istg it’s not that hard, just clean up your plates. We’re all adults here, start acting like one for the love of god

Man I’m glad my boss at Panera keeps checks on students who don’t clean up after themselves. That’s ridiculous.

Same thing by the Chick-fil-A, stop leaving your trash on the tables

They are waiting for Mom to clean things up. Need to grow up!

I'm not one for child abuse, but when I see things like this, sometimes "they could've used some of my relative's good ol' Asian discipline via wooden spoon" crosses my mind.

Well, they could simply be going to get more food.

So sad to see this again, people wasting food :(

Unrelated, I miss Ike’s

The bun burger

Oh shoot. Where is this

Now that’s embarrassing

Same kind of people who don't notice when their room becomes a pigsty.

I used to work at Ike’s, and part of the job was cleaning tables every 10 minutes. It was frustrating because people would intentionally leave their plates just before I was about to clean a table, knowing I was coming. I brought it up with the manager, but she was really rude about it.

Bro got 3 buns on his plate.

You can’t speak to the entitled that way.

these are the same types of kids to leave the shopping cart in an empty parking space

Is that a bread sandwich 😂

u care so much to not do it yourself though

this isn't entertaining or unusual rudeness that we can all enjoy being very appalled by, it's like "can u BELIEVE i found THREE CIGARETTE BUTTS on the SIDEWALK". not good behavior but also not interesting, put some more effort into your OC

What do y'all do, remind them to clean up next time?

Or maybe some Black discipline with a belt. Extra points if it had the jewelry/diamonds on there

That’s what we thought, but they didn’t come back in the 35 minutes we were there

they hammer sustainability down in my management classes like we are some sort of social scientists bound to change the world when we can’t even change habits on our own campus. Pitiful.

When I’m in a stupid ass take competition and my opponent is you 😱😱😱

I think he restricts them from coming in. He’s banned students before. But in the end I think his strictness makes it better for the employees

Y'all are talking about assault over a school food that the staff can also handle towards as well. 💀

Ok, they were definitely dip shits who don't know how to clean up after themselves, then

Honestly based

let me guess you are one of the people who don’t clean up after themselves

I don't even eat over there, let alone go inside restaurants in general, so nice try. 😂

Hope everyone is surviving their exams, papers, and projects

Lol me and bus 498

Social Distancing in Action.

That place is usually bustling with activity. Kinda eerie to see it empty. Wait what are you doing in there?

[The JC is straight up depressing right now.](https://i.ibb.co/VQjXVRv/2.jpg)

Whole campus is depressing. I have to stay on campus for the remainder of the semester so I’m practically in Potomac by myself. Shit fucking sucks but I can’t even go home.

Maybe the wifi will actually work with no one in there

Damn it’s been so long since I was in school there I could barely remember what it looked like regardless of the countless hours I spent in the JC. Great pic OP.

God, I miss this place. I miss going to classes.

r/AbandonedThemeParks

Not once have I ever noticed design of the tiling of the floor.

That's crazy to see it so empty

Amazing photo.

Been here a few times, and I have seen it empty before.

The tables laid out like that don't really do much when people just pull chairs from other tables

Lmao ppl r still on campus?!

Had to print some stuff!

*50,000 people used to study here*

Get naked and run through the hallways.

Won’t have to worry about your fire alarms going off now

Was construction still going? I wonder if they stopped.

Unless it was them all along!

Oh we’ve had two over break (three? I’m trying to remember)

Core campus construction is still going on. The weird part is some people were working on the closed off areas next to Enterprise / Planetary hall at 2AM!

I think it’s 3

yeesh. Probably shift work, then. Shift work is the worst.

Waiting until 5AM to announce is cruel

Not surprised. GMU could be crawling with White Walkers and they’d still wait until the morning of

They knew they were gonna cancel but still waited until the last minute

I used to really hate that when I worked there. I would normally have to get up at 5:30am to make it to campus by 7:30. On snow days they would usually send the alert text around 5:00am or a little earlier, after which I couldn't get back to sleep. So on a perfect day to sleep in, I couldn't.

I just find it silly. Like. Admin, you really waiting until 40% of your employees are gonna have to call out for their kids school being closed? We are a university, our students are OK with a fuckin day off. They don’t have make up snow days or shit like that.

I’m absolutely convinced they write these the day before, early, and then schedule them to send at like 5:03 and 5:12 the next morning as a “gotcha” to professors and students

Ikr I had an exam today was up until 2 studying for it !!

genuinely why do they do this

Are classes cancelled too?

I mean it’s still before classes start so I don’t get what the big deal is or why it’s cruel

Leaving the door open for Jon Snow to show up 😂

depends on the professor - some of mine just gave us the day off and i have ONE class today that’s online usually it says in the syllabus what the snow day plan is, or they send out emails first thing in the morning

Dad’s Old GMU ID Random but going through my parents’ photos, I found my dad’s old IDs from when he worked at GMU, and man, have they upgraded since the late 90s! (Name and face blurred for privacy reasons)

Your dad looked hot

Damn, hope you inherited that jawline! 🔥

That is so cool😎

Ur dad is fine as fuck respectfully

Funny, that's also what my first fake ID looked like and that worked at the Giant down the road.

interesting that the HR department used to be outside of campus and down the road next to the fire station!

i kinda like the older look more

Thought it was just me 😭😭

I was hoping someone would notice that! I guess everyone’s too preoccupied with my dad’s jawline 😅

bring back the fountain in the jc! ⛲️

I always figured that was a fountain. I'm assuming people kept throwing their spare change into the fountain which is why there's little brown marks all over the bottom and figured it was cheaper to just drain it than do an upkeep on it.

They probably got tired of people getting in it because they were dared or drunk or pledging or just thought it was funny. Source: I knew people who did it for those reasons

i had no idea that was a fountain, i eat lunch there a lot

They stopped putting water in there when I was a student. I always assumed it was because people put soap or something in there to make it all bubbly.

How old is this picture?

I believe they were turned off in the early 2010s. I remember them my freshman year in 09. And I'm pretty sure they were off by the time I graduated.

maybe! that could've been a cool tradition at mason

I know of a fraternity stunt from the early 2000’s where a guy wore a speedo and goggles and swam in it and broke one of the sprayers. No repercussions just a sad janitor mopping up after him. It was funny until it wasn’t.

LOL this is why we can't never have nice things

now you know 🥸

Probably a sorority/fraternity thing, or a dare

LOL this why we can't never have nice things at gmu

The people in the picture are not quite clear enough for me to discern their clothing or hair styles enough to get an idea of the era when this picture was taken. I remember the fountain back when the Johnson Center was new. The trashcans and the screens at the info desk look familiar. Too bad the picture does not show the food court, then it would be easier to narrow down.

Sad... I just found out that the open gap under the stairs was a fountain. Do you know why they turned it off?

I remember that!

It’ll have to be after 1990, but before the pandemic (I’m assuming that’s when the fountain went away?) No laptops in sight, so not after 2010. I see like the distant outline of collared shirts on top of bulky sweaters on some of the men. Very big around the late 90s.

One less thing to clean, maintain, and repair. Plus indoor fountains are often seen as an 80s and 90s trend. Maybe they thought it looked dated. Most malls have filled there's in as well for these same reasons. It's a shame because I like the look of them.

I looked again and I think I see what you mean. There is also a woman with a scrunchie holding her pony tail, which I recall from that time. According to this [article](https://www.gmu.edu/news/2022-07/retro-mason-johnson-center-dedication-1996#:~:text=The%20JC%20is%20the%20brainchild,for%20whom%20it%20is%20named.) The Johnson Center was dedicated in 96, which tracks with my recollection. So maybe the picture is from around the time it opened? I just remember how disruptive the construction was, paths were closed, and the detours forced you to walk a considerable distance further.

that is true, but they also removed the outdoor fountain in front of the JC

The JC | March 2020 vs. November 2024

were the tables “socially distanced” set up or was there just that few tables before covid

2020 looks like a chess board.

Bring back the fountains or whatever that thing is under the staircase

Looks like that on the left anytime you go there during the weekend too

I hate the JC. Worst building on campus by far

[Social distancing was fully enforced by that point.](https://www.reddit.com/r/gmu/comments/flkbu1/social_distancing_in_action/?ref=share&ref_source=link)

2024 pic is about how it looked 2019 and before. You could even swap the dates around and most couldn’t tell the difference

That's not a fountain, it's just wall to stop people walking under the stairs and give another place to sit.

Worse than East Building and David King Hall? 🤔

Boooo 🍅🍅🍅 JC is the home of the Patriots! (and most of the food options)

https://www.flickr.com/photos/gmuarchives/5014594651 It did have a fountain at one point.

Food options are all mid

Thank you for the old photo. I did think that wall was weird, the fountain explains it.

That's fair

Gorillas loose on college campus!!!

Good job comrades, that was on front page of Reddit

These guys were hilarious, brightened up a rainy halloween!

IF YOU LIKE SOMEONE, TALK TO THEM Idk who needs to hear this but I felt like putting this out here, dk why some people hesitate to talk to people they like. I promise you nobody bites because you don't know if the feelings are mutual and if they are you would wanna hold on to that person before they move on from you. So say something. It's worth taking a risk. Not taking risks won't get you anywhere and this applies to any situation (ex: applying to grad school or job, exercise, traveling, etc.). Also you may never see that person again after the sem is over... After college or grad school, you're gonna be working everyday and that's pretty much it.

I'm gonna talk to my gym crush next time I'm at the RAC. Pray for me boys

The last part hits really hard. I liked someone during my final undergraduate year, and I just didn’t had the courage to confess to them. After graduating, now I don’t see them anymore and I don’t think I ever will. Wish I could go back, but I can’t. Oh well we learn lol.

Facts. One of the biggest regrets in life is missing opportunities. Take the fucking risk now!! At least you'll know how they feel about you. If they aren't the one, that's fine — at least you tried

I go to Howard but this came up on my feed I’m going to talk to mine at the fire department.

I just asked out a girl who is a grad student here for coffee this week and she said yes. So, it is going good for me right now.

Asked out this girl that I’m in a class with and she said no, but still highly suggest that if you feel something take the chance. Hopefully class isn’t too awkward for the remaining month

facts better an “oops” than a “what if”

Yeah it’s pretty liberating after they reject you as you know for sure after. Sadly, I had her in my class for 3 semesters straight after that so it made it a bit awkward.

Not necessarily related to having a crush on someone, but I feel like this applies so well to just making friends in general. I was walking on campus to the engineering building earlier and I walked by someone with a Goldlewis Button on their backpack (character from Guilty Gear Strive), I stopped them to ask about the button, and had a little conversation with them. Idk, it was just really cool to see :>

i took a risk and ended up at a hotel 😅

Bet, proposing to my professor this morning lecture

This post appears way too on time ha so let me vent my story out. I transferred to Mason two years ago. There's this class I had to take and it's either with a notorious professor or a very nice prof (her class was actually marked "recommended to transfer" I believe). The problem is, of course her section was full. So I waitlisted and came to her class. For some reason it was not as exciting as I thought, so I thought about dropping out and just enrolled for sure in the other prof's class. Then came a boy, walking straight to the first row of the lecture hall (I was in the second row, cant concentrate if I sit in the back). Of course I noticed him, the only one in the first row middle of the class (so right in front of the professor essentially). He was ... interesting I guess. Very attentive tho, answered all the prof's questions with quite an interesting accent. Immediately I took a liking to that. Luckily, the waitlist opened to me (I was the third in the queue so thank whoever not accepting that). I sat behind him all semesters, looking forward to the class so that I could see him. One time I had a reason to ask him a question and that literally drained out all of my courage and energy. I had no friend at Mason at that point, so I was just so happy. But then the semester went on and I went back to not daring to talk to him. Then I found a friend, who later knew about my silly crush and kept pushing me to talking to him. I of course had no ball to do so. Then came the very last day of the semester. My friend, who at this point was so fed up with my inaction, literally pushed me to talk to him and yeah, I did, asked his discord. I remembered getting out of the class and literally jumping and running. We then hang out for one time. Next semester, I found out he's taking another section same as me. Of course I was happy. We talked, but inside class only. Got him into the same group for the group project and found out he was actually pretty funny. Then before my third sem, he actually showed me his schedule and asked if we're in any class together. Sadly, I registered terribly late and did not get into any section with him. Well, somehow his section got cancelled and he transferred to, guess what, my section. Got into the same group project again. I then started to talk to him outside class. It was not easy tho. He wasn't very talkative and on top of that we just had different interest. This sem, my friend, the one who pushed me to talk to him, once again helped me and we now ended up in the same friend group that hang out more often. I am now very happy that he opens up to me way more than before. And we're good friend now. I wish I can say we are more than that. Well, the reason I hesitated talking to him was because I am gei and he's not. So yeah, in the beginning I just felt like there is no point. Lately it's starting to hit me that I'll probably not see this boy again after graduation and every now and then I will just feel extremely sad about it. I am still grateful that I talked to him first. He will a good memory of my college time here. Sometimes I wish he know about my feeling, I don't even need any reciprocal feeling, just wants him to know I have a silly one-and-a-half-year long crush on him. At the same time, the last thing I want is to destroy what we have currently. But yeah, happy to know him. If you reach this point, well thank you for reading. If you feel the story is somewhat familiar, please say nothing to anyone ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|grimacing)

Well thats how me and my boyfriend met and I had no idea he liked me back! We have been dating for about more than a year now and I am so grateful that we both gave each other a chance! I feel like I'm the luckiest girl alive when im with him! 🥰

The sign I needed to finally tell her

Attended another college before GMU. Met my husband first semester, was dating my finals, and have been together for almost 7 years. So heavily agree

This works if you’re attractive

I don't have a crush on this person but they just seem so chill and cool so today I was finally gonna talk to them after class but they left before the professor was done (the professor had gone past class time) so now I'm assuming they have a class after that one and so I should get to them before class but I don't wanna seem weird waiting for them what should I do?

I actually needed to hear this, thank you!

rooting for all of you guys

I liked this guy for a semester and I got to see him the next semester and I asked him out for coffee, I’m not sure if he got the hint… but it’s better to go for it than say what if!!

The last few times I tried this, the girl was either already taken or gay.

"If you want the girl, do whatever it takes" shoresy

I wish I could to this but something just holds me back…

I don’t even know how to break the ice. 🥀

So if I don’t find a gf in college it’s over for me?

Counterpoint: don't talk to me

I’m rooting for you bro!

You got this dude 🤙

You got it, OG ✊🏻

you mean “our” gym crush big dawg

Update: Turns out she has a boyfriend. She was super polite and sweet though, and I’m glad I got to chat with her a bit before asking for her number. Still happy I went for it—probably wouldn’t have without your post, OP. Thanks for the support ya'll <3

Good luck bro! It’s a sign 🪧

The fact that someone downvoted you is hilarious. They’re just sad you’re winning! Keep it up g

How did it go if you don't mind me asking?

Oof but what you did my guy was the bravest thing ever that not many people can do. I’m proud of you for taking the risk. Sorry you had to deal with that tho

I mean, if u didn't make it awkward then no big deal

Bro def has a type

I’m here for it!

Turns out she only likes girls 😞and she’s in a relationship.

Went well actually, we seemed to click pretty well. We hug and kiss each other before heading off that very night.

That's great to hear!

Never believing in love anymore

Sorry I can’t help but laugh imagining someone watching this dude recording himself kicking a bouquet of flowers on campus

Go crush those exams instead of those flowers

Acting like the flowers broke yo heart😭🙏

LMFAOOOO DELETE THIS

i honestly hope this is just someone from the theater department showing us their homework

See you at the gym bro

The worst mistake is finding love at GMU 🤣😭

Unless the girl who broke your heart is mother nature, there's no need to litter.

This is so dramatic lmao

damnnn who hurt u

see you at skyline man, keep your chin up 🫡💪

I'm sorry bud...I feel for you.

Stair master for the next hour 100% recommend. But in all seriousness, take it as an experience. You were able to learn and build a relationship with someone. You could use this time to work on yourself and focus on your goals.

Y'all are fucking mean let them have their moment who cares

I stayed single at GMU. only thing that hurt me was the dining hall food. gave me rumblies in my tummy

"it is better to have loved and lost, then to never have loved at all." Just be glad you can get a relationship in the first place bro.

mans really recorded this and was like “yup this the one” lol jk

damn =))) how bad is she. We need some info to check

Wat they do to ma boy 🙁

im lmaoooooooo

Lmao the video made me laugh, but all jokes aside, what happened? ☕️

I might have seen that bouque with an asian guy

It’s college. You’re young. Wait till you’re like me; 2 divorces and a five year old. Then start complaining .

Nah filming this and posting it is crazy this generation is cooked

Man, those flowers didn't deserve that!

there’s no way this isn’t satire right 😭😭😭

This might be the best shit ever put on this subreddit. Can we pin it?

Im sorry you got hurt but please don't let one person ruin love for you this person wasn't the right one and I'm sure there's someone else out there for you as someone who has had there fair share of heartache it does get better

LMAO bro post this on all your socials, then she’ll see how much you loved her and come back to you

Bro you don’t NEED a relationship, esp at gmu 😭 ppl here are not all that anyways

![gif](giphy|LVcWdTyfDUh73dnCIU) /s

Plz say you threw that away after and didn’t just litter

Lol settle down bro

That reminds me of when I was in undergrad and had a crush on someone for the longest time and try my luck to ask her out and got rejected. It happens **¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯**

Yeah me either , what happened ?

This is so sad dude get tf over yourself

How old are you, out of curiosity

Did you at least pick it up after

To whomever canceled spring break I get why you did it: to minimize covid exposure. That said: go fuck yourself.

I just don’t understand why they couldn’t push it closer to the end of the semester and go virtual like they did with Thanksgiving break... it’s exhausting

Seriously limping to the end here... my grades have taken notice lol

i am literally losing my mind.

At least it’s only like a month left

Yes brother preach!

Yeah, spring break is usually when I play catch-up and get my shit together for the rest of the semester. I’m a slow starter and it takes me forever to get in a groove. Didn’t realize how critical that little break was.

To the guy who canceled spring break, you know what else will minimize covid exposure? If you just stop breathing

This would have made the most sense.

Yup. Just gotta think “All I need is to make it to Friday” three more times

Yeah, people try to dismiss the criticism of no-spring-break to "well you're usually doing work over the break anyways!" Sure, but it's a week where I don't have to worry about going to classes, new assignments, and just catch up. 'Least the end is in sight.

Now if this isn't the damn truth

dang my mom said this literally like, 2 nights ago? She didn't say exactly 3 times/how many more, though, so all I got is that I have to "just make it to Friday, but there's another after that...and after that...and finals in May..." Actually seeing it like this does feel a tiny bit better

GMU professor's has blogged about 'how to find virgins' for decades

Wdym for decades?

"I exclusively watch content that has women that dont fuck and men that fuck all the time cuz thats cool" - this dork probably Unhinged, and also, gross. But also, yuck. Dare i say, yikes even

Mom said its my turn to repost this in the last 72 hours.

Just from that previous one I'm not surprised. It was a dead giveaway bc who the hell says that about an AI video 😭

I have seen this man. I’ve heard him speak and I’ve even read some of his most recent book. He is simply so grating, unbearable and self-important that it would not surprise me if he was still a virgin himself.

Get him fired immediately

Imagine being such a snowflake that you cant watch a movie unless the consenting adult actress on screen hasnt had sex before

Who knew the guy that teaches a chapter on “Why Price Gouging During Natural Disasters is a Good Market Signal” would be a scummy human being

quick existential sidebar if you'll indulge me-- What is the virginal status of an AI actress. She doesn't have a physical body to have sex with, but if the implied fantasy here is lusting after a sexually inexperienced Tilly Norwood, is it that she's programed that way, and could someone not just generate an OF for her or VR porn? Would that person then still see her as a virgin? would they just "wipe her memory" or deprogram or replay whatever to recreate that first time experience again? How does the social construct of virginity and the material behaviors that surround it change when there is no material body to act upon?

Tyler Cowan is a respected member of the GMU faculty and is a responsible contributing member of the Fairfax community. He has multiple interests, including creating and updating a "foodie" blog for years, featuring and highlighting small family owned international restaurants. Slow your roll friend and take your outrage elsewhere.

Cancel Culture Much?

Just one example from his blog in 2009: [https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2009/09/where-to-find-virgins-go-to-urban-churches.html](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2009/09/where-to-find-virgins-go-to-urban-churches.html)

I am neither condoning nor condemning this professor’s action. This comment causes me to ask a simple question. Should a professor be fired because they hold beliefs that are unwanted? If so, how are the correct views identified? It seems to me that having a faculty with a wide diversity of opinions gives students the greatest opportunity to listen to many perspectives and form their own opinions.

Ngl when you put it that way it’s nuts. But then again if he’s not hurting anyone idk none of my business

Your reply reads like a cookie cutter defense from the Vatican. Or the Republican Party. Or any other institution normalizing abusers. So you are saying you are cool with a GMU professor fetishizing digital virginity?

2009? Oh come on, that was only...👴🏻

aaaand of course its from the shitty economics department.

Creeping on girls isn’t the type of opinions we should allow specially for someone like him that could abuse his position of power

This is not a fucking diverse opinion or different perspective. What is wrong with you?

Yes. Duh. Fucking obviously.

It’s really sad to see how many downvotes you got. Cause I agree, it’s his believes. We might not agree with them but he had a right to express them. *prepares to be downvoted*

If you’re getting downvoted, isn’t that just the free market of ideas doing its thing?

Were not saying that he doesnt have the right to express them, were calling him a gross loser bc hes expressing them

At least you were prepared to be downvoted for your bullshit.

There’s hundreds of AI related topics to discuss in the context of economics and yet…virginity comes to mind with an academic? Really…? That’s fucking weird and it seems to fit a pattern. That said a “respected member of the GMU faculty” is clearly a [low bar](https://slate.com/business/2018/04/economist-robin-hanson-might-be-americas-creepiest-professor.html). What a strange thing for you to defend

Correct hence the post title and that only makes it worse. GMU administration is a toxic bunch

Not really because you get censored on the subreddit if you have negative karma

So, what your saying is, I shouldn’t be allowed to downvote you (which is a free expression on my part) because your opinion is somehow too special for that? My expression should be curtailed in favor of yours?

No, I'm saying YOU SHOULD be able to downvote freely as long as nobody gets censored/banned because of majority opinion. On this subreddit, folks with negative karma can't post or write comments. If that rule didn't exist, I would be all for you downvoting freely in this market of ideas.

So you want this subreddit, which you neither own nor moderate to obey rules as you see fit? Guess what? That’s yet another attempt by you to suppress someone else’s free speech, genius! Maybe take a constitutional law class if you feel so inclined to lecture people while being so obviously wrong.

Please shower or at least use deodorant or a cologne! The in-person classes smell so bad sometimes. If you think you smell, you probably do, just take a shower to be safe (daily shower to be more specific). If you think your shoes/socks smell, they probably do, please change them. Deodorant is your friend, never leave the house without having deodorant applied. Forget face masks for covid safety, I'm about to start bringing full on scuba gear to avoid the smell of students. As a person who actually takes showers and wears deodorant, I seriously don’t understand how some of you can go weeks without a shower. It baffles me. I’ve been dealing with it for a while, but it’s gone too far. Taking a daily shower costs five minutes of ur time. Get up off ur PC set up and turn on the shower Do it please. I’m desperately asking.

POV: you’re a CS major

Found the CS major

CS department should offer extra credit to the students who shower and smell good

CS major here. I also do not understand why my fellow classmates smell so bad and do not shower. Y’all are grown adults and should already know basic hygiene. I was thinking if you have time to procrastinate on your coding project, then you certainly have time to hop in the fuckin shower. Please shower guys, you’re just accumulating dirt and bacteria day by day.

These comments about CS majors are so true.

CS people be like

School needs to hand out deodorant, mainly in CS Department

I recommend the Old Spice sweat defense. It’s pretty great. This is what I use: Old Spice Hardest Working Collection Sweat Defense Anti-Perspirant & Deodorant - Stronger Swagger - 2.6 oz https://a.co/d/jcmslTN

shut up i take a shower at least once a year signed, your local CS major

On the opposite end of the spectrum, does anyone know why some of the suadi arabian guys at mason literally shower in cologne?

I really don't know anyone who doesn't shower daily. It's been a long time I took in person classes but I never experienced anything like this. It could also be dirty laundry and not necessarily the body

That feeling when you hit the gym a little too long and now you gotta go to class.

I use Dude Time Spray, bro.

That happened to me today, there were a really bad smell behind me that I could barely handle it.

this, and keep your beard fresh and hydrated😎

I was a cs major and walking in those classes was FUCKING terrible

Why not just say something? They're going to need to hear it eventually. If not now, at their first job when their manager starts getting complaints and HR needs to have a discussion about it. A little peer pressure might be beneficial in this situation.

College educated and still doesn't shower daily bro like hell naw 😭

POV: You major in women and gender studies

5 bucks says you didn’t call them out to their face. Kind of a bitch move to just complain here on reddit

Fuck off. Let me stink in peace

No. Just do more blow you won't smell shit. Shit

Arabic cologne is their bread and butter. Also, they want to smell amazing.

It’s part of their culture. They want to be a walking flower making everything they pass through smell good

Ain’t no way this is an actual club wtf

TMW the sweat in your beard looks like falling Matrix characters.

too much to ask sry

It smells so bad though. I shouldn't need a gas mask to get into an elevator to you. It's worse than old ladies.

But like how hard is it to just call out these rude ass people. Instead of being a coward and shouting here into the void

Just 3 weeks left to get through

Yeah I can’t focus worth shit nor can I remember any of my assignments anymore I am sO ready for this semester to be over

I've lost focus long ago. I'm literally commenting in a sleep deprived haze all over this subreddit because I've lost any purpose or meaning for this semester. Join me, I'm really, really, extremely bored, but at least I'm not [u/BasicallyImBored](https://www.reddit.com/u/BasicallyImBored/) lol

Found this little guy swimming into mason pond

I honestly thought that was a Platypus for a second, but looks like a beaver upon further inspection. I didn't know we had those.

Be careful there might be bears swimming at night

That is incredible! Such a rare site to see in mason

It’s a government agent, be careful

This mans be swimming in the water and whatnot

What is that?

He’s watching people not flush toilets and wash hands at the Johnson center

A few years back I once saw a turtle or a tortoise swimming around by the bridge in the Mason pond area.

We got beavers here?

And here I thought you expose your beavers I the privacy of your cars in Lot K!

Holy cow, that's 100% a beaver.

I didn't know we had beavers! Awesome!

Me neither haha, this was my first time seeing one in person

A platypus? (Puts on hat) Perry the platypus!

First i thought it Perry the Platypus but it does look like a beaver haha he just chilling at night

that email is when I know I’ve been up for too long

Y’all I thought this was optional..... but I never opened their emails so that’s my fault 💀

I’m off campus and haven’t gone to campus at all. I haven’t done a single one the entire semester. I have never gotten a email from someone saying I have to do them so I think I am ok.....right?

My professor said she would occasionally check if we did it but never did

It’s not optional? I’ve been off campus this whole time.. I don’t have to do it right?

I...I’ve never filled this out 💀

Filled it out for the first few times and stopped. Have not received any warnings. Also haven't stepped into campus grounds the entire semester nor do I have plans to do so.

I thought it was optional too, I’ve not opened any of them 💀💀

yeah you're good lol

no you don't

No considering you’re supposed to do it. If you don’t they’ll email you angered saying that they’re going to take action if you don’t. This really applies to on campus students more. But it’s just better if you do it then not doing it. For off campus students I’m sure even if you’re all the way in Delaware they want you to do it.

Create a folder on Outlook, then make a rule to move all these emails to that folder and mark them as read. I've been doing that the entire semester, never have to worry about it.

It’s too late now I’m not filling any out 😂

True. It’s on campus students that have to do it daily but before thanksgiving everyone had to do it. I’m still pretty sure they might send out a email to a student who hasn’t done it recently.

i only do them when i have to go on campus tbh

Police Raid Mason Students’ Home

Lol 12 man raid team + four year ban from campus for a spray paint vandalism.

IN THE EARLY morning hours of November 7, more than 12 police officers showed up outside at an address in Springfield, Virginia, knocked, broke down the door, and raided the family home of two Palestinian American students at George Mason University. University and Fairfax County police refused to show the family the warrant. One Fairfax County detective with the FBI’s Joint Terrorism Task Force — cross-designated as a local and federal agent — was also present. The family and Mason faculty supporting them, however, believe they know what the FBI-led investigation was about: the young family members’ pro-Palestine activism.

Thanks for posting a paywall article

How they get that warrant about there being firearms and there not be any…. Sounds about overkill.

I can see there being bias against protestors from government, that’s a tale as old as time, but the implication GMU has pull with the FBI Joint Terrorism Task Force is an interesting one?

Hopefully the ACLU can get them some representation because no way this was done above board

A raid team that broke down the door and included the FBI joint terrorism task force, this is insane. They were rounded up in the living room while the raid took place for six hours?? Confiscated electronics, they brought the unrelated son up on bogus firearm charges that were later dismissed. This is intimidation straight up. For spray paint???

That's so f'ed up. Those poor students. That's waayy overkill.

Don’t agree with the repaid but fully agree with suspension. Honestly it should be expulsion and barred from university in future but a full police raid is Way too much

What does the size of the team have anything to do with it with? 12 seems pretty normal. And four year ban for vandalism and no jail time sounds pretty good. All and all good outcome.

I reposted the entire article anyways

Put a fake email

It's not. It asks for an email and that's it.

>What does the size of the team have anything to do with it with? 12 seems pretty normal It isn't by any means "normal", for something like that 2 officers are more than enough. They used 12 people, knocked on the door but broke through it anyway, and refused to show the family the warrant. It breaks the principle of proportionate response. Personally wouldn't be surprised if some lawsuits come out of this.

Especially when they assign 12245577 assignments a week

Thank god I only got 12245576 assignments.

Too true. Also, is this really a screenshot of a picture of an instagram post of a tweet?

And when the due date of the assignments is in the middle of the week.

That’s a screenshot of a tiktok video of a picture of an instagram post of a tweet 😂

That's awful. I try to play videos faster. x3 is my limit. x2 is my norm. Now when I hear people IRL, they seem slow

And I just screenshot this to share with my friends via text.

Oof Choices choices… https://dining.richmond.edu/ https://foodpro.students.vt.edu/menus/MenuAtLocation.aspx?locationNum=15&naFlag=1 The quality of food at Mason is a fucking travesty, but it’s not like their priorities are for boarding students, like ever, for anything.

Mason meal plans have, and always will be, a total fucking ripoff.

Welcome to GMU 🤣, Scammer of top scammers!

What a rip off. You can do better and healthier quick meal prep for significantly less money than that.

Oh yes you did mfr

the eaterie is currently carrying me, its so, so much better, but you gotta pay \~2.30 extra alongside your meal swipe

You paid money for this?

My freshman year half my dorm got sick cause they served raw chicken

Actually, you did. 🤷‍♂️

I go to Southside occasionally when I’m feeling picky and just want random stuff on my plate (or a whole lot of cereal) but I don’t find it worth it for the meal plans. I went to a Mennonite University once for a retreat and their food was better than Mason’s

The Spot is carrying me atm. If you don't care whether you eat meat or not, then it's a good place to go to.

I thought this was Flip Kitchen, which I generally have good experiences with. Then I looked closer and realized it couldn’t have been based on the plates.

I will tell you, they're still not like... Great all the time, but ikes on its worst days is as good or better than Southside on its best days. I wish they'd. Swap the chefs. Southside being central is so much more convenient.

Went to get a late night snack at Ikes, had a cockroach sprint at me from in between the couch-style seats

Average southside meal tbh globe neg diffs (though you have to go on an expedition to get there)

yummy delectable morsel! enjoy!

That’s on you bucko.

It is a hit-and-miss sometimes. You can always go back and request a custom-made one (extra meat or something different).

Wait how come that was $3,000 or so?

I wish I could give you an award for this

I've gotten plastic in mine too 😭 not the soft plastic film on cheese either, a chunk of melted and resolidified plastic

To add onto what everyone saying, at Ike’s ones time some kid came in the salad bar

I should have specified that I paid roughly that much for my meal plan to get served bread with a dabble of meat 😭.

They thought they saw an “e” at the beginning of quality and ran the other way

I didnt realize until I bite into it too. I was sitting there thinking “man this is pretty difficult to chew” only to pull it out of my mouth and see cooked plastic.

RIP reddit gold

Lmao they charge for the plastic wrapping, so you got what you paid for ig 😭

Prof showed up late to the exam, did not have enough exams. Exam was suppose to start at 7:30 today, upon arriving we were informed that we will start at 8:15, with "reduced complexity" but the same length exam. He showed back up at 8:30, handed out exams to realize he did not have enough. He left while half the class worked on the exam and the rest of us sat around. By the time the rest of us got the exam it was 9, he then proceeded to make corrections to the exam. I'm pretty sure i failed the exam, and the class (you have to pass the final to pass the class) What the hell do i even do? This is ridiculous.

If you have proof of this, or potentially enough other classmates backing this statement up you can always take it to the dean

Should give you a curve for all that stress

all y’all that had this class should bombard the dean with emails. the last thing they want is for someone to sue bc they weren’t given the proper (AND REQUIREDDDD) amount of time for a final which will effect your scores

This is a perfect example of the fact that Mason will hire ANYONE to teach. Dude taught in IST about ten years ago, and was FIRED. Now he’s good enough for CS. You can’t make this up. DO BETTER MASON!

Write up a brief and factual accounting of events and timelines as you have outlined above, and email the head/chair of the STEM/Humanities/whatever division and express your concerns as to how your exam experience was not in keeping with the literature used to promote (insert department@gmu), and is largely different from any other you’ve had at GMU with any other professor up to this point.

Report it. Our professor was fired for far less last semester. The replacement "professors" just simplified the course to a ridiculous degree and asked us to resubmit assignments. They just handed As to everyone.

Did he provide an excuse for why he was late and unprepared?

You should report this to the Department Chair, Dean, Provost, and President. When you report something like this to a single administrator, they might just sweep it under the rug. But they won’t do that if they know that other administrators are aware and watching. And, if possible, you should get other students to report it, which will add credibility to your own report.

This is literally demonic behavior.

I emailed the dean. I had already talked to him this semester about this class.

Yea bruh, we’re you in there too?

He is in hot water if he doesnt curve it. Many students didn’t finish due to the time restraint

Socrates is a lot of things, but he’s not fucked like this

no. he has a habit of doing stuff like this though, so i was disappointed but not surprised. the entire semester has been super hectic, he constantly made empty promises and took forever to grade our project 1 and midterm. we literally just got project 1 back last week and it was due the first week of february. it’s very likely the same thing will happen with our finals.

Nah, it can’t be my glorious king, Radu😭🙏🏾🙏🏾

Lmao no, just sounds like 211 shenanigans

I was, the exam didn’t start til like 9 smh

Who's your professor? I have my 211 text next week 😬

He said he is only gunna grade the first 80%, the rest is extra credit because of the time. So basically the half that started early got extra credit.

He needs to throw y’all 50% just for having the 2nd group start the exam half way through the exam block.

It's northern Virginia. It seems reasonable, honestly. (Reasonable to expect someone to do it... Not reasonable to actually do it. )

there’s education attorneys. you can sue for literally anything these days lol

I haven’t had a class with him, fortunately, but his name pops up here periodically for weird reasons. For example, a couple weeks into Fall semester he vanished from his classes and the next week a new instructor inexplicably took over. Sounds flakey to me.

wtf? thats nuts

That’s totally unfair

Message the head of the department first then if it isn’t resolved go to the dean

Yeah, I do remember my mom telling my and my siblings about stories from working in county health. Lots of lawsuits, lots of lawyers, and lots of people able to afford lawyers. To be fair though, a lot more of the lawsuits threatened were reasonable because at least in county health there's lives on the line.

Yea lol sorry, the exam just covered some stuff that was blatantly incorrect.

Oh you're good. I don't even know why this showed up in my feed lol. But I figured it was worth mentioning in passing

Where construction is tradition

I have to share the walkways with robots that can’t decide where they want to go and end up having a seizure if a person gets near them.

and how poor the results are

I lived in NoVA from 1993 until last year. Some shit never changes

even if you close the 24 hour dining hall

Is it like this in other unis

Saw a meme on the NoVA subreddit that replaced GMU with i-66

Koch is a helluva drug.

The robots are, in my opinion, worse than the construction.

Any that’s worth it’s salt. Trust me, you want GMU to be making these changes. If not we’ll all be complaining just as much about our dilapidated, asbestos-filled building the administration isn’t doing anything about

That was the original...

But ngl some of the robots do be kinda vibin around campus doe, I aint stressin 😳

Other universities handle construction much better though. I transferred in from JMU and construction there was much, much less inconvenient to students

No because the background was blue on that post

How many more emails will they send?

Anyone able to set up their student email on iOS? I picked Outlook account, and entered [mynetid]@masonlive.gmu.edu but it says the account doesnt exist, even though I'm using it right now on my pc

I was stuck on campus for 5 hours in my dorm waiting for the lights to come back on. Luckily my food didn’t get spoiled

Just got another one, an email AND a text

It was a problem 10+ years ago. Can build/rebuild buildings on campus, but can't keep the lights on in weird weather.

Download the outlook app

Gotta set it up as an exchange account

it says Exchange admin will be able to remotely manage my device, collect personal data including messages and photos, add/remove accounts, install and manage apps and remotely erase my device?? wtf

Yeah it's really gross, but as far as I can tell it's just how the microsoft exchange system works. Either you let it do all this stuff or you can't use an email client from a third party. Mason can choose who they use for email, but they have no control over how that email service works. It's unlikely any of those scary sounding features would ever be used but I don't blame you for not allowing it on your device

I’m having the same problem. It’s funky af

oh lol I never would have noticed. Seems to be working normally. never had an issue

These messages at Ike’s are crazy, it’s so funny

Bro said “fourth leg” 💀💀

do they know what goon means

Glad to see old feud between southside and ike is still going. Southside is better and I will die on this hill

I see my future and it is BRIGHT.

Southside ahh 🥀🥀

Southside so nasty! Same food as last week!

Last week we had **patties!** This week we got **patties!** Next week we have **patties!**

Missing home I need some Asian food Gimmie that Korean BBQ Gimmie that Korean BBQ

I was watching this YouTube Short and realized the Johnson Center was the background 😂

Makes sense. That’s part of the JC looks like a mall food court.

Cool. What was the video about, Norway?

ReplyAllGate Good Morning Glorious GMU Students (sadly this list is less than 35,000). So, on Wednesday on my way to Fairfax for my 7:10 class, I checked google maps to see how bad traffic is and if I need to use a different road to get into campus. On this particular day, traffic was the worst I had seen. The campus being at a standstill was a given, but all the roads outside of mason were also backed up, some of them for about a mile (worst I had seen). Once I got on campus and finally parked, all the way in the back, I get out of my car and hoof and poof all the way to class. Later I get an email saying their professors will contact students about missing class, because of a power outage. I was tired and miss the "Because of a power outage part of this email". You know, all good, no biggy. So at this point, I am thinking to myself, "traffic caused students to be late/miss their class, wow, that's not cool". So I decided, Mason needs to know my thoughts and feelings on this matter, because you know, I'm so important. I send them an email saying, "not cool mason....". Come Friday morning I receive an email: >Your message dated Thu, 8 Nov 2018 17:22:12 +0000 with subject "Re: > >University Registrar: Class Adjustments due to Power Outage" has been successfully distributed to the GMU-STUDENT- USA-L list (38114 recipients). followed by: >Yo I dont know you but you might have sent an email to a bunch of people by replying to the school wide email lmao And so, my weekend has been the best weekend ever. First, I want to thank the academy, this would not have been possible without you. Secondly, I would like thanks everyone making memes, your time and effort are appreciated, and worth it. lastly, I would like to thank the absence of blind carbon copy (BCC). At this point in my career, I think it is best I retire while I am at the top. Thank you meme'ers!! Below, I would like to post some of the best reply's I have received. (half of these people replied all back. lol) >Lol you just replied all to like... the entire University. > >Gg bro. &#x200B; >Lol dude your message sent to all GMU, pull back! > >Best Regards, > >Fellow GMU Student >go off queen &#x200B; >Hi, this is \*\*\*\*\* \*\*\*. > >I am so confused what is this email for. Is it really meant to be sending to me? > >I cannot understand why this has came to me. At least can you tell me what happened? > >Moreover, i cannot see the all the words of the email in some reasons. It just don't show up to me right now. I don't feel good hearing that you are doing something more work. Can you please be more accurate? > >Thank you. And i hope you have good days. >In other news, 35,000 students discovered you can reply to everybody. >Dear “Aatanas2”, > >I agree that it is a bust to have to afford extra time to a class that was cancelled due to a situation outside of our control. The saying, “an issue on your end does not constitute an emergency on my end,” resounds with me on this. However, this is life. Unforeseen occurrences befall people every day, and we adjust to the circumstance. If humans did not adjust to inconvenient circumstances, we probably would have gone extinct long ago. The caveman, although he was tired, did not tell the sabre-tooth tiger to come again after his nap. Rather he found the gumption to get up and run, or defend himself. Once, you graduate, you will run into this situation numerous times- guaranteed. The people that give up or complain, never seem to see the next promotion or raise. Rather the people that can deal with this type of situation find themselves in rewarding situations. > >I hope this short paragraph helps you deal with this hard time as it has helped me in the past. Also proof your message before you send it out to the entire school. Another suggestion would be: hit “reply” and not “reply all”- big difference. Take care and best of luck with the rest of your semester. > >Sincerely, > >\*. \*\*\*\*\*\* >Yeah, that's life... &#x200B; >You do understand that you replied to a service that won’t look at it and you replied to the entire body that got that original email. Just do the work like everyone else. >I don’t think you meant to send this to me. > >Professor \*\*\*\* &#x200B; > It's not cool sending out an email to the entire student listserve either...especially since the recipient you're trying to get your message to, the Registrar, won't get your email. &#x200B; >[https://www.amazon.com/Dont-Reply-All-Tactics-Communication-ebook/dp/B018MGHZWO](https://www.amazon.com/Dont-Reply-All-Tactics-Communication-ebook/dp/B018MGHZWO) &#x200B; >lol &#x200B; > iconic. &#x200B; > What’s good people &#x200B; > Heads up, you replied to every single mason student 🙃 >I think you just sent that to every single George Mason Student, haha. :) &#x200B; > Is the whole school on this reply all? &#x200B; >Today I learned that this listerv isn't moderated &#x200B; >Would you like some cheese with that whine? &#x200B; >Good morning, > >I beg your pardon?... I don’t think I understand what this is about. &#x200B; >Did...Did you just respond to the entire school? Because if you did, that’s really impressive. &#x200B; > I don’t know... what’s cooler? Learning what you paid for, or emailing every single member of the GMU student population? > >Friendly reminder- watch out for that Reply All button. It can come back to bite you in a professional capacity. &#x200B; >A power line was cut accidentally due to construction calm down >i dont even have class on Fairfax but i agree with you bud. >You just replied to the entire university with your whiny and mistyped nonsense. Congrats, dude. &#x200B; (I'm only at half, and I'm skipping some of them... oh, this is tiring) &#x200B; >Yeah, you're completely right. How can they do that??? &#x200B; >You just replied to entire student body lmao &#x200B; >Yo, my mans is right. Preach 🙌 &#x200B; > You realize you sent this to the entire school including the graduate students right ? (they have found me out, I was trying to get to the grad students) >Dear aatanas2: > >Thank you for sending a message of concern in response to the all-student email related to the Wednesday, November 7 power outage. I apologize that your response was mistakenly sent to all students. We always appreciate hearing concerns and the compliments, and I thank you for taking the time to respond. > >With best regards and wishes for a productive conclusion to your semester, > >\*\*\*\*\* (yah. my bad) &#x200B; >Keep it up girl, voice your concerns (thanks bro, I'm a bro ;) ) >hi >you hit reply all lol &#x200B; >That’s not cool…. It wasn’t our fault but now we have to do extra work, because if eagle bank arena…. > >I am pretty sure the message that you sent did not get to the people you intended. > >But as a gmu student, I sympathize with your anger…. > >Good luck with your studies &#x200B; >aatanas2, > >I'm assuming by your reply that you're an undergrad. Let me share some tips with you. > >First, whenever you send a reply, look to see who is in the recipient field. By now, I'm sure you realize your reply was sent to the entire student body and contained multiple grammatical errors. Let this be a lesson learned for when you get into the workforce. Unlike college where something like this has no ramifications, mistakes like this can get you fired. > >Second, life isn't always fair. Sometimes things like power outages happen, but that doesn't always mean you get a free pass. Again, going back to whenever you enter the workforce, work doesn't necessarily stop just because the power goes out. You find ways to make it work. The university left the decision up to the individual professor to assign makeup work. I'm sure it's safe to say your probability of your own professor now assigning you extra work just got a lot higher. > >Lastly, we live in time when fake news and evidence-based arguments often clash. I'm not entirely sure what your statement about Eagle Bank Arena is all about. Assumingly, it's in regards to paying for it. Eagle Bank Arena has been in existence for many years and was formerly The Patriot Center. Over the years, funding for higher education from the state has significantly decreased. The naming rights to the Patriot Center was sold to Eagle Bank for $6.6 million for 10 years with an option for an additional 10 years for a total of $13.7 million for the entire 20-year period. If it had not been for this, that $6.6 million would have been generated from tuition and fees. Bottom line, don't just through random statements out there without 1) clarity and 2) evidence to back up your claim. > >In closing, I don't know if you intended to email everyone and what kind of response you have gotten, but I would be remiss if I didn't use this as a teachable moment. I remember what it was like as an undergrad, and I wish I had someone here to help me through some of my mistakes back then. That's why I'm reaching out to you. Best of luck with the rest of the semester. &#x200B; >Congratulations guy. You’ve become a meme. >if eagle bank arena what? im really curious >Thank you for sending that message to everybody, it made my day. >You tell them!!!!! &#x200B; https://i.redd.it/7dm9x39ssix11.gif >NOT COOL AT ALL! > >MUCH LOVE FROM ARLINGTON CAMPUS! >Almost like we came to college to not do work.

Here are the photos >Got the wrong email, my dude. However, I'm sorry to hear that you got extra work. School was being unreasonable. > >Have a good weekend! (all good, I didn't have extra work. Just looking out for my fellow brethren) >That’s not cool…. It wasn’t our fault but now we have to do extra work, because if eagle bank arena…. &#x200B; > That’s not cool😤🤬…. It wasn’t🙅‍♀️our fault🙈🙈 but now we have to do👏extra👏work👏, because if eagle🦅bank arena….👅💦💦😉 (MA MAN!!!) >I want to apologize that I'm emailing you, because your email is probably exploding with fame you didn't ask for, but it's important to me that you are aware the GMU subreddit is making memes in your honor. Come for the fame if you want it! There's someone who's made a reddit account of "aatanas2" acting like they're you. > >Rock on legend >Wait, aatanas2, > >How did the eagle bank arena cut power to half of campus on wednesday?

You even had professors responding to you, hahaha! That's amazing. I love the wide range of responses too. Everything from memes to people taking it super seriously.

I was talking to the creator of the fb meme group and they said they got like 50 new members just from the influx of memes that came from your email. Thank you for your service to the meme community.

Oh my god that’s amazing. The Amazon link was pretty good lmao

you know mason is a boring campus when people have fun through emails

I love the person that just randomly wrote an essay about eagle bank lol. Weird flex but ok

You sir will be deemed a legend in this campus

This is absolutely fantastic. I'm the second to last email, who mentioned this subreddit. Good on you for taking this well. Edit: after actually reading those two longer replies; wow those two are real dicks. Comparing college to cavemen and sabertooth tigers? Calling out fake news? Oof.

a legend was created

am grad student, your email made my day. Here's to you, Aatanas2.

Bruh some of these people are lame af.

This is the best 😂 those responses though 👌🏻

So *how do we know* you're the real aatanas2? Time for another scandal

Some of these replies don’t seem to know how listserv’s work haha You’re not supposed to respond to them but there’s a way to auto configure the reply-to to make this behavior be expected lol

lmao props to you for being such a good sport about it. I love the wide range of responses you got

Damn, Cabrera didn't respond?

I love all of the emails from the tryhards and returning students trying to school you. It's so unbelievably sweaty.

Missed opportunity to make that amazon link an amazon smile link.

Most welcome. I just requested to join

Might be my favorite one

>and contained multiple grammatical errors. Let this be a lesson learned for when you get into the workforce. Unlike college where something like this has no ramifications, mistakes like this can get you fired. >..... >Bottom line, don't just through random statements out there without 1) clarity Did anyone else catch this lmao

YYYEESSSSS!!!!

If its on the internet, it must be true.

Shit, can't argue with that

Eagle pride??? Have I been repping the wrong mascot for years?

damn how desperate can one be 😭

Why do you need someone else cap and gown??

>Eagle pride I didn't know I graduated from American University

Recommendation: if you have something expensive and/or important….have your item redirected or directly shipped to a pick up point. I’m sure it was either FedEx or UPS that delivered it. You can have it shipped to a FedEx or ups store. Maybe a hassle but well worth it as we see.

Eagle pride is crazy

That’s really sad to hear

People are so pathetic in this life

Something this expensive should be sent to a locker or be picked up

And that happened?

The thief would have no use in the thing he stole……

I want to say what everyone’s thinking…

sympathy; almost there and this happens

Doctoral regalia is crazy expensive. My husband got the cheapest and it was $800.

It looks the same as normal mason graduation gowns??

they didn't know what it was. They just take whatever they can get and resell it

Doctoral cap and gown starts at $800

Usually deliveries of goods valued at $500 or more had to be signed at the door. At least that's what I recall being UPS's policy.

And sadly, they probably just threw it away

Insane dude

I know, right?? We were flabbergasted.

At least some other countries get cool things like swords when you get a PhD in Sweden.

I saw some people standing in the frozen over Mason pond (Please do not do this, you could fall into freezing water)

I mean this would have been fine when temps were down to the teens. But it’s almost 50 degrees today. Unless this pic is old.

The pond like 3 feet deep they’ll be alright

I could understand people doing this last week when it hit like 9 degrees, but it's like 45 degrees out now

Natural Selection at this point... How many times has the county sent out warnings to NOT do this? There's been more than a dozen hospitalizations in Fairfax County within the last month for similar results from standing on lakes that appear to be frozen over. While the Mason pond is rather shallow, it can still be fairly dangerous.

Lmfaooo kids be doing anything for IG these days!

Let them enjoy 😭

This is a photo of candidates for Darwin award

🤣 Come on it’s a drainage pond that things knee deep max!

I did that as a kid.

Mehh let them, if want to be idiots then let them.

To be fair the water is like knee deep lol

Let’s hope they do.

Let them have fun. Stop hovering

I saw some people playing hockey on the ice when I was walking back from class one day, granted it was 10 degrees but still

I mean don't do it now obviously but it was fine when it was like 20 degrees out cause the ice was so thick.

Just go suck the joy out of everything then why don’t you

Let people enjoy things

Good. Is not like brains will be lost. They just taking air unnecessarily, I say: let them drown

this\^ i saw people doing it when it was like 16º out which was fine but now it's way too warm for that

It’s 3 foot deep but there’s multiple feet of silt at the bottom. The pond was supposed to be dredged several years ago to clean the bottom off but Covid hit and it got delayed indefinitely. All of the runoff of road salt and sand and garbage flows into it. People have gotten bacterial infections from coming into contact with that water.

I don't doubt it but is there anywhere I can find proof of this? I don't intend to get into the water but I've always been curious

I do not have proof. My info is from a coworker who has worked at gmu for close to 20 years. He says he’s seen it dry and overflowing in his time.

That's pretty cool. Thanks for answering.

Babe, its time for your weekly dose of the President!!

He's so neutral and mysterious 😍😍

No matter how many times I block his emails he still forces his way back into my mailbox 😔

I would also love a salary of $1 million per year just to send out dry, lukewarm sympathy emails once in a while!

People like to shit on the president but really this is all standard and I have no problems. It’s like the temper tantrum people threw about the listserv getting the reply alls deleted. The email server isn’t a public forum.

Has the president taken a side? People definitely have a right to counter protest or protest and not be assaulted. I very much believe in political neutrality in official statements by a public university, but violence in these cases is never protected. Nazi's free speech has been protected numerous times, even by rhe ACLU. It really doesn't matter what his flag was, unless he was threatening or assaulting people. I'm happy to live in a country that allows for freedom of speech and expression, even ones I disagree with.

*tired sigh*

I cant wait to graduate so I know for certain that not a single dollar of mine will ever end up in his pocket again.

I hate that I'm paying 50k dollars for this school for a masters degree.

can we get a new prez pls

Glad to know I’m not the only one experiencing this at least.

I'm so sick of this man 😭

What exactly was non-peaceful about the protest? What was unlawful about it? And as someone who works at a business in the Johnson Center, maybe it was a *little* disruptive, but when there is a genocide happening, people have the right to be disruptive??

735,000??!!!! DAMN how old is he

he aint neutral I can tell ya that much

This site allows searching by employee: https://govsalaries.com/washington-gregory-159484671

Hey now— how else would a non-professor admin pay for a bespoke sport coat with Mason lining?

1 mil??? More like 200k max

The reality is that if he “picked a side” the university would come under HEAVY fire and would likely lose a lot of funding/support from donors. Then everyone would be pissed that there isn’t enough funding. If Pres. Washington said anything supporting one side or the other in an email he’d probably be replaced so fast your head would spin.

There was a student with a Lehi Jewish Terrorist Group Flag. This led to an altercation between the two protesting groups.

"at which time an altercation broke out among protestors and a counter-protestor. University police intervened quickly to stop this and detained three individuals, who were not formally arrested. A criminal investigation is ongoing," How else should he have phrased it? I was there and although my view was limited that's basically what happened.

i think they’re being sarcastic 🤣

He makes more than the President of the United States!

Ha, no. If only. His salary is like 750k and this year he got a performance bonus of 125k.

And I’ll add that these kinds of watered down generic emails from the president is not unique to GMU. Most university presidents do this for the same reason. They’re running a business and that business will be put in jeopardy if they step on any toes.

I also disagree with user ANALCREAMPIE69420.

He really deserved that performance bonus that’s 3x most of GMU graduates salary for those heartfelt emails

When you graduated, what was your major and starting salary for your first job out of college? When you graduated, what was your major and starting salary for your first job out of college?

I did an internship with the Big4 and received my FT offer with them. Don’t worry, not having an internship doesn’t mean it’s the end of the world or you’ll have a hard time finding a career after you graduate.

Started a graduate assistantship job at the same school bc I didn’t know what I wanted to do and they paid for 6 credits/semester and $15/hr. Didn’t like my masters field so went to an accelerated nursing program instead for a second Bachelors. Now I’m a travel nurse making 100k+ yearly with great work life balance. In hindsight I should’ve went to community college for the first two years for free through the STARS program and transferred to a nursing school to save debt, but then again I wouldn’t have met my friends and husband, and I can’t blame my 17 year old self

Criminal justice. But was working in HR. Just got out the military after 4 years & my job in military was HR so that’s the “only experience” I could get with a job. Starting $57k. (federal position)

UrbDic definition of Mason 😃👍

All entirely valid frankly

I see no falsehoods here

Hey did you know we even made it to the Final Four that one year?

Parties never stop cause they never get started. 🤣🤣🤣

Why is this more relatable after graduating

I heard one time we made a basketball tourney a few years ago.

The great thing about GMU is

Except the cold part. As someone who just transferred home from a school in ohio i can say unequivocally that northern va is not cold. (Though I concede it is not warm either).

Wait, what???

I lost it when I read that BIG FAX

hey, as a freshman in second sem im really enjoying my mason experience despite the school’s ups and downs. make some friends, do your homework and you’ll be fine

It's not really that bad.

Winters used to be cold now they're pretty pathetic.

Cold humid methinks. I have never stayed in Ohio long enough (only drove through and it was cold af), but I don't know if it gets as humid there.

It's not that cold, but I've noticed when I've driven from Richmond up to DC that it's consistently colder in DC than it is in Richmond. Like, I can get into my car being comfy in just a sweater, but when I get out I'll need a jacket.

When things open back up more and we can be on campus more freely it will be even better. I am predicting a much more normal Fall '21 semester since by that point the majority of the country should be vaccinated.

I wouldn't know about the cliques. I made like 2 friends and the covid happened

Some places aren't diverse enough to be cliquish

Ramadan Mubarak to all of my peers at GMU who observe or celebrate. May you never be shamed for praying outside, may you never be shamed for how you dress or the beautiful languages you speak amongst your friends and family. Do not let anyone tell you that you deserve less because of your faith or where you’re from. You deserve the space to live, to worship or not worship, you deserve this space to grow, to make friends, to gossip, you deserve to learn and study and succeed and to fail and you deserve to be able to try again. And at night you deserve the most hearty and delicious iftar. You are loved, you are beacons of this community. Ramadan Mubarak.

Ramadan Mubarak to the homies

This is sweet! Ramadan Mubarak to you as well ::)

Aw 💗 thank you 💗💗💗

Ramadan Kareem 💕

Ramadan Mubarak!! may this holy month be full of blessings and joy for all inshaAllah🤲🏻

Some cool/creepy pics from tonight 12/10/24 Campus looked really awesome tonight with all the fog and barely anyone around

I need to find my wife ahh university

Silent hill ahh fog

This shit is just like science hill !

I took some pictures too but i didn’t get what i was seeing either.

In my restless dreams, I see that school…Silent Mason

RIP student apartments

I had a stalker at GMU during my stay. Guy was obsessed and somehow knew all my classes. Got to a point where I had to go through the very bottom floor on Marten Hall & Planetary to get out and not see him. Worse was my night classes. I swear I saw him in behind every tree. Got so bad a cadet from Mason Police would walk me to my car every night, and one night my stalker was actually waiting for me at my car. I had never given him a ride 🙃🙃🙃 Thankful for the Mason police!!!

This is the version of mason I remember 😭 those cold nights walking back to ur car in lot A after an evening/night class

Wow no starships in sight. Truly magical

Damn that’s pretty sick

In my restless dreams, I see that town. Silent Hill.

Of course the day I have exams looks like silent hill dawg

It seems so calm

Are you one of those people who were walking around taking pictures today?

the residents might be evil

silent hill ahh university

Shit looks like president evil fr

Yeah pictures really can't do it justice!

Hmm, I guess? Pictures taken on my way back to K lot from Fenwick

Russian flag rolled up out of display at Katherine J. Johnson Hall by someone

What the hell happened to the sun and stars in that Filipino flag lmao

W, Can't have the flag belonging to a government of war criminals Slava Ukraini!!🇺🇦 Слава Україні🇺🇦

Imo we should just remove it entirely for the time being as they’re, you know, committing war crimes

I didn't do it.

As it should

Hope it stays like that

Maybe sun damage? Idk I’m probably wrong

Pretty much all of the flags in KJH are very faded

They got married off

That or it looks like it might have been accidentally placed flipped to face into the guardrail. Would be strange to have a one sided emblem on the flag though

Average pro putin puppet trying to turn it onto something else

Believe me, I know they won’t. It’s more or less wishful thinking. Sadly history repeats itself.

Oh wow I didn't read the post properly, I thought someone pulled out the flag for display, not rolled it up. This is what happens when you don't pay attention 🤦‍♀️

Conservatives want him fired. This president says he’s not going anywhere. George Mason President Gregory Washington lacks Harvard’s resources and is facing calls for his ouster amid four Trump probes. He says he won’t quit.

Professor Bryan Kaplan says education is a waste of time and money. I agree: taking classes from him is a waste of time and money.

He's in "I wish a .... Would..." Mode 👍🏿👍🏿💪🏿💪🏿

In January, we’ll have a Democratic governor. Just hold tight.

So proud of him!

Fucking good

I called it lol.

![gif](giphy|nI5KVjlMB0BXOsi4aI) That's my president right there

is he still pushing for dei?

He’s an Econ professor the comment is not surprising in the slightest lmao

If you or a loved one has been victimized by IT 207 Hoda Hassan, See Below Greetings all, If you are in GMU IT 207, you might have received an Honor Code Violation email last morning. You, and many others, are very confused. After a peer of yours sifted through the data of their own violation claims - the following was found: 1.) The professor omitted critical information in the assignment instructions when giving their forms to the Academic Office of Integrity. The critical information omitted, was the code that she gave us to complete the assignment. 75% of the code to complete the assignment, was given to us by the course co-ordinator, given the claims are AI-related Plaigiarism most of us are confused on how this claim could arise when the course-coordinator provided us the majority of materials to complete this assignment in writing. Furthermore, we are confused as to why she would omit such details.2.) Upon review of the assignment, the remaining 20% (this totals to 20 lines of code, give or take) was our job. This does not aid in beating the allegations of AI utilization, however it is of probable cause that "the fucking intro students can handle 20 lines of code without resorting to AI" - I digress. 3.) The Course-Co-ordinator herself, labeled the specific instances of reasons to suspect AI have a theme revolving around "using advanced techniques not taught in the class". Our findings point to every single "Advanced technique" used, being taught in IT 106. Which is a pre-requisite course. Every advanced technique referenced, is actually a basic technique. For example, the use of a Try/Catch block is considered advanced when it is taught in a pre-requisite course as a basic technique. Why can't the co-ordinator tell the difference? Unsure. 4.) Not only was the claim based on her not knowing the difference between advanced and basic techniques, but her supporting evidence is simply her throwing the lab assignment through AI - and the output that is there, literally is code completely different from the assignment and anyone else's own code. Remember, she gave us 75% of the code. That means when given the instructions from the lab, AI will change 75% of the code. Given that most people's code, looks like the code given to us by the instructor, the AI Input-Output screenshots show that she not only fails to read students' assignments, but also her own documentation in regards to accusing students of cheating. 5.) Evidence of one student conversing with Hoda Hassan is present, where they had an honor violation in progress, met with Hoda, and had it dismissed. Why Hoda Hassan does not give that privilege to the other 20 people accused in this way - we are unsure. If you or a loved one has been violated by this woman send me a dm - we are attempting to make a group effort to bring light to this.

Go to the dean straight up. A single person and a persuasive explanation can help the group rather than waiting for the group to form

Please share this with the dean asap, this class is literally so ruthless for no reason

The very next step you take after reading these comments needs to be going to the dean, with exactly this information

Man, you should have taken 207 back in the day before it was revamped. We were writing full on apps in PHP lol. I reluctantly admit that GMU asked me for ideas in terms of restructuring the class. It looks like they didn’t listen to me that much lol. Anyhoo, this is some bullshit. It’s ruining creativity and self education. The instructor doesn’t believe their students are capable of doing anything other than what is spoon fed to them - any type of over achievement can’t come from the aptitude of the student, but the aptitude of an AI model in their eyes. That’s absolutely fucked.

Have you talk to office of academic integrity to show your claims. If thats true looks like an easy dismissal of the case.

This is beautiful. I love it when students stand up against professors. Especially the coding classes. Most of the professors have no idea wtf they're talking about. Also, eff 206 / 209. Great job, OP!

Guys I got hearing coming up and will explain as much as I can. 75% code was given by her and my code doesn’t even match chatgpt code that she added into the files submitted

Along with the Office of Academic Integrety I would submit a tip about the professors actions to the Office of Institutional Compliance as by your description the professor bypassed the requirements of the faculty handbook.

Graduating right before the advent of AI was a blessing.

just got a zero on Assignment 5 from Hassan for a try...catch statement. Sent them a long email with my rationale and included the fact that it's taught in prereq courses where I used them with no issue.

Im taking this class next spring semester… Am I cooked chat?

Wow it’s crazy that this class still has not improved since the last time I took it. My lowest grade ever at a college level course was from this terrible class.

Man I’m so glad I took 207 back when we were still using PHP so I wouldn’t have to go through all this bs🙏🏾

This class is so brutal. Still doing terrible on my second attempt. I'm just hoping for a large curve at this point.

That’s crazy If y’all can try to create a grievance/complaint form and then submit it to the chsshelp@gmu.edu Another thing you can try is to make a Google doc and have as many people as you can write their complaint in it then try and give it to the department head or the Dean if possible We did that in chem2 for an issue we were having with the coursework and it worked. Super sorry about this tho this sucks.

Did your complaints get through to them? She's teaching two sections this upcoming Summer semester...

She sounds like a dog

Was it the latest assignment ? I literally didn’t even try because it was so confusing and we were supposed to know a lot of syntax I’ve never seen in my life before and know how to use it . I took 109 (python ) and then just starting to write JavaScript from day 1 of class was so confusing. Plus she is doing the exercises in class she is going super fast

I ain’t reading all that, but can someone summarize why basically happened?

Strongly suggest working through the academic integrity process. Although I do understand that it is changed this year, that office previously was the only office that could affect the outcome once it had been submitted. They will likely have to go through each student report individually, but if you have a description of the general issue as you've described, each student can include that and then also discuss what is distinctive about their assignment.

Send it to the Dean too - more people complain the better

hey. im following up because this is happening rn to people in my class. can we chat or can u tell me about the outcome of your email.

Yess , start learning JavaScript

Dawg I might be taking it over the summer

DO NOT USE THAT EMAIL ADDRESS. That is for the College of Humanities and Social Science (CHSS). IST is part if the College of Engineering and Computing.

Summary: u/Short-Willow-7056 can't read at a 6th grade level

I took it this summer but I had an internship and other classes so I had to drop it 😭

What a beautiful sight…

Good fucking god, finally. The scaffolding must've been there for a good two years or so.

What happened? I'm out of the loop.

Gonna miss bumping shoulders with you guys.

This just cured my depression

That's honestly insane

No way imma have to go check it out in person 😂

OMG can't wait to walk there next week

What actually changed from the scaffolding?

I walked past and my jaw dropped…gotta walk there next week :0

That's where I tripped. Scaffolding made it unstable and slippery

Feels weird to see it like this

They finally finished construction there lol. I didn't get to enjoy any of the new campus shit since I graduated in 2020 😭.

NO MORE SCAFFOLDS!!!

Oh finally they removed that piece of thing 🥳

I thought I was going to graduate before they removed this.

Ah yes, the Joker Stairs

Man, this brings me back to the good old days.

The ugly scaffolding is no more! But construction continues inside the building, nonetheless.

Structural stability between the sidewalk and building wall are now inter-transferable and will last much longer in the grand scheme

The school available budget.

The window sills were either engineered poorly, or were constructed incorrectly, causing them to crumble and drop chunks of rock down onto the walk ways. The scaffolding was just there to protect people walking under them so they don’t get concussed by a falling rock.

As an immunocompromised cancer patient trying to finish school if you are not vaccinated and dont mask you can fuck right off. **EDIT: I've gotten over 100 death threats in the 48 hours since this post (Just marking them as spam and moving on). Probably because some GMU student posted it to what is somewhat of an alt-right haven of a subreddit (who has still not taken it down despite the literal threats being tossed about). Thanks whoever u/Snake44101 is...** ____________ I don't care WHAT the dumbass governor and attorney general think. They still think Critical Race Theory is a real thing. Clearly, they are not smart enough to understand the realities of the situation or understand that "Pro-Choice" means that in public environments everyone needs to have that freedom. So my CHOICE is to attend a public school. My health condition shouldn't make that choice impossible. Therefore the school as a PUBLIC school needs to make it acceptable for me to be able to attend if I CHOOSE to. If that path means that people have to be vaccinated and masked, then those who want to CHOOSE not to be vaccinated and masked can CHOOSE to stay the fuck home.

Why can't they just make the choice to come to campus optional and increase accessibility to online recordings or live lectures? Do I really need to be crammed into a room full of 100+ students just to hear the professor say something I could have heard online? On top of this, you still want us to come to campus when I just got an email telling me one of those 100+ had COVID?

Fight for online classes

Good luck brother - keep fighting the good fight

I'm so sorry. the school has completely forgotten about students like you. best of luck to you.

I hear you buddy. Type 1 Diabetic and pretty sure I'm taking a big risk coming to campus at this point, but I need this degree ASAP.

Vaccination is a tricky issue to argue but masking? Non negotiable. It’s not like it’s hard, just fucking do it, it’s as simple as you showing care for anyone besides yourself.

So the governor and AG are "dumbasses" because you disagree with them? You must be a Democrat!

I hope local news voices the cases of people in your situation and how these kinds of policies screw people over during the pandemic. I'm pretty disappointed gmu went backwards after requiring vaccine documentation Is there anywhere we could submit complaints to GMU?

Being vaccinated doesn't make someone less likely to spread Covid

Email the provost explaining the situation and raise concerns about your life threatening situation. It’s a data point to give people to help make decisions

locking this thread as it's gotten to the point of harassment and uncivility

The dumbasses that are antivaxx have a choice too tho

They lose out on money

I mean even if the University showed some fucking spine for once and chose to fight the attorney general on it, some classes simply can't really be done online. At least... not every part of them. But I do agree that the University (who hasn't even publically addressed it yet which is inexcusable) is being absolute shit at handling it. And I do plan on suing their fucking asses 5 ways from Sunday if I get covid from a classmate as I am protected by the ADA act. I would hope other disabled or immunocompromised students would feel the same way. How is it fair to fuck us over like this when we are already being fucked over by our bodies.

Some people are vaccinated but do not wear a mask. I see it all the time in the jc building

Exactly. Ive used this point before in other debates online. At the end of the day the argument for personal choice or freedoms ONLY holds up if that applies to EVERYONE. And by that logic, if you endanger others by not wearing a mask and not getting vaccinated, you are infringing on someone ELSES freedoms and the whole "Pro-Choice" argument goes out the window. It's idiotic that people still try and debate from a position that ALSO proves them wrong haha.

That's my next option but some classes don't have online options and I am somewhat stuck between a rock and a hard place because I am so close to graduating. Either I have to delay (which financially I can't do), or have to do at least 1 class in person. I am already in a rough spot because my doctors don't want me attending in-person classes if the university isn't Vaccination required but I don't have the luxury to necessarily delay. Pretty much I am fucked by both the decision of the new politicians and GMU itself not standing up to a reckless and idiotic decision that directly contradicts the ADA (law) and CDC guidance.

Can you request to take online classes through [the Washington Consortium](https://registrar.gmu.edu/topics/washington-consortium/) as an accommodation if we don't have an online version at Mason?

Sorry to hear of the trouble. For whatever reason I had zero issues getting my classification as disabled and immunocompromised approved via a doctor's letter and a few medical record documents. I will say it was a PAIN to get more than the bare minimum accommodations approved. Probably a big issue with GMU is their legal and financial departments are too heavily intertwined with people and politics that are far more anti-vax and anti-mask. So when it comes to both money and legal responsibility, they could give a shit about anything that they view as limiting others freedoms, even if its for the safety of the whole.

Actually not. But my politics are not the point here. The point is that they are going AGAINST CDC guidelines and science itself and putting me, as an immunocompromised individual (and likely many others) in an impossible position. But nice try and baiting.

> Is there anywhere we could submit complaints to GMU? I've tried but it's so hard to contact anyone beyond the dean of your individual school section or your advisor. They really limit access to any higherups at GMU it feels like. I've already called my state representative but obviously, they have bigger things to worry about.

This isn't accurate. Can vaccinated people (IF they catch covid) spread the latest strain (Omicron) as easily as unvaccinated people? Yes for the most part this seems true. (Although this wasn't true with prior strains were being vaccinated made it less likely they would be able to spread it). **HOWEVER...** being vaccinated DOES limit the potential for someone to GET covid in the 1st place. Therefore it makes it less likely to spread Covid through that mechanic. It ALSO limits the severity of the infection which limits the potential severity of the spread. So while someone vaccinated might get Omicron and be just as able to spread it should that occur, they are LESS likely to get covid in the 1st place which makes a vaccinated person actually LESS likely to spread covid (if they don't get it), and less likely to spread as significant a viral load to boot.

I mean I am fully documented by the University so one would think they already have the data point but sure it doesn't hurt to remind.

That is literally the point of the post. If you are pro-choice it goes both ways. How can I have a choice if others' choices risk my health to the point where I no longer have a choice? This is why the whole "pro choice" mantra is nothing but a trumped up excuse used by people who are antivax but afraid to actually state as such.

Good shit fellow wsb colleague . I agree Downvote if u have $100 in bank account

Your choices are fucked up if they harm other people

your username 🤣

You are correct. Less people would purchase parking passes and food on campus. Also many professors prefer to teach in person so they can get verbal responses

and its fucked to pay full price for school then have to do it online if u dont want top

You do realise that vaccinated people still contract and transmit covid right...? I mean you have the right to be mad. I was mad when I got it... from a vaccinated person. And have been deeply irritated when I've been exposed numerous times by fully vaccinated people since my covid recovery. Why? Because you can contract covid twice regardless of your vaccination status. Yeah kinda pisses me off. But honestly, what helps me to keep my blood pressure in check is that, if I get it again I more than likely won't be symptomatic, and that I'm doing my best to prevent myself from contracting it by sanitising the shit out of everything and giving off an unapproachable vibe so that people keep their distance.

Seeing as even after this latest nonsense by the Attorney general about vaccines... masks indoors are STILL required... https://www.gmu.edu/safe-return-campus/personal-and-public-health/face-coverings ...those folks could easily be reported. The problem is no one wants to generally rock the boat and do that cause its a hassle and reporting it doesn't do much because the campus police don't really do much. And honestly, I don't blame students for not reporting because honestly the university probably wouldn't do anything anyway other than "advising" the student to wear their mask indoors (and the student will promptly go right back to not doing that).

Your freedoms are not being infringed by someone else not getting a vaccine. That is such an absurd argument.

Luckily over 90% are vaccinated but we don't know how many got the booster...

The good news is the majority at GMU are vaccinated due to initial requirement. Im thinking the number is around 95%, is that correct? I’m not sure how they’re reporting boosters tho and those weren’t required to be uploaded until February. Anyone know if data on boosters is out there somewher? Haven’t heard about mask mandate being lifted anytime soon so for this semester at least hoping everyone (especially those most vulnerable) can stay safe.

> I've tried working with ODS to get my classes online since none were offered and I kinda need it for my disability and they just said "No" 🙃 Did you have a doctor's note? If your doctor has stated you need to be able to take the classes online, they legally can't say no or they break the ADA act. Like you can legit sue the shit out of them if you want to and it's an open and shut case. This is part of why I was bitching. Because I am in a similar position but because it's not so much the school but rather the attorney general forcing the hand with regards to WHY I am having an issue... it's gotten more complicated. ___________ **EDIT:** adding an image just to show how simple a note should be (obviously censored a bit to protect privacy). This is the terminology my cancer team rep used previously: https://i.imgur.com/q0rBmc0.png Note the terminology "recommend" because legally THEY cant force the school to do it. However, if the school does not, they instantly break the ADA act law and you can then go back to your doctor/team and take further steps to prove your case. Granted taking the step to sue is a big one and costs money so... its tough to even take that step.

Asymptomatic vaccinated people the majority of spreaders now.

That data isn’t shared or advertised internally due to regulations. You need to be direct with SLT when it comes to issues like this.

This has to be the lowest effort WSB account of all time

They may be selfish and stupid choices, but they have the freedom to make them.

Thanks broski ❤️

That is what Microsoft Teams is for.

Pre covid online classes costed extra, they added a bs fee called distant learning fee...

> You do realise that vaccinated people still contract and transmit covid right...? Of course they can. I even acknowledge that in another comment in this post. However the chance of a vaccinated person getting covid in the 1st place is lower, even if we account in the Omicron strain, and as such, vaccination limits the potential for someone to spread covid by simply limiting the potential for them to GET covid (along with limiting the viral load they carry). Obviously, vaccination goes hand in hand with masking and other safety measures. But I guarantee that because of this new policy, people are not even going to mask as much and it's going to snowball into certain segments of the population just not giving a fuck about others. It was already happening even WITH the policies in place. You don't think it's going to just get worse now?

Had to share here...

I appreciate a good cup of coffee.

lmfao the last one hurts

I’m a CRIM major so that last pic ain’t that wild to me. But I’m pretty sure that first pic was me lowkey

When coming to campus, I always used gave myself an extra 30 to 45 minutes to find a parking spot. As far as the food goes, when I'm hungry, I'll eat almost any kind of food, no matter how unhealthy it is. I agree 100% on the morning classes. For the last picture, I think it really depends on the major of the person and the person themselves. I graduated in May in a field that I think is in high demand (IT), and I'm still unemployed, although I feel that's partially my fault. I should have and could have done more to prepare myself for post-college life while I was still in college.

Last image is like English majors

As someone that went to GMU for undergrad and graduate school I would recommend staying around the DMV area. This area has a lot of job opportunities and if you did well in school you’ll find something. For some context, when I first started to apply for jobs I applied to 100+ jobs. Got hired, learned a lot within those first 2 years, and was recruited by my current employer. Honestly, you’ll probably find an entry level job, learn the shit side of the trade, but also learn about where you want to grow professionally, and then make career moves to achieving that. Most other places don’t have that type of professional growth that the DMV has to offer.

History majors in shambles

Have you seen the economy?

History and English majors actually perform pretty well. It's the Spanish, psychology, and education majors that are really fucked.

Yes. Do you understand how the economy works?

In what world are education majors fucked in terms of getting jobs? Very worst case there are always sub positions open, but admins are so bad these days that teachers are career switching a lot and leaving positions open.

What in? Not an English major myself, but I'm always curious what humanities majors in general get employed in.

I think educators as a whole are fucked simply because in the USA they are underpaid. Seriously, they are. You couldn’t pay me a 6-digit salary to put up with a bunch of bratty kids and snotty parents who think they know how to teach better than an actual teacher. Fairfax county pays their teachers well too, at about $60k/yr... but you need a masters degree. Not worth it at all. A lot of counties around the nation pay their teachers less too.

Spanish and elementary school education are the lowest paying majors there is (which psychology not very far), they are on par with the median high school diploma, and underperform an associates.

Some people don’t do it for the pay tho. You got to remember that. I’m a teacher and I love it. Plus I still don’t have my degree lol.

That's true, but I think this response is about the last picture in the meme, not employment in general. The lower pay would make it harder/take longer to pay off your loans.

Did you guys hear that the Arlington Campus is closing early due to a power outage?

I never get alerts and all of the sudden hells gates have opened.....

For starters, why are all of the campuses losing power so much? What's going on? I definitely agree that we need an unsubscribe option, because I will never have to, or have any desire to, go to any campuses besides the Fairfax one.

RAVE Guardian: Hey, the power's out in Arlington. Personal Email: Hey, the power's out in Arlington. Mason Email: Hey, the power's out in Arlington. SMS: Hey, the power's out in Arlington. Mobile Mason: Hey, the power's out in Arlington. RAVE Guardian: Hey, the power's back on in Arlington. Mason Email: Hey, the power's back on in Arlington. Personal Email: Hey, the power's back on in Arlington. SMS: Hey, the power's back on in Arlington. Mobile Mason: Hey, the power's back on in Arlington.

It seems like there's a lot of power outages. I'm convinced at this point that if you're a student living on campus, you need to own a generator. It makes me glad I'm a transfer/commuter student

I deleted the app. It was too much of a microaggression lol

I unsubscribed from them today

I would give you gold but I’m poor so 🏅

Isnt that campus for grad students?

Currently getting texts and calls from mason, texts from NOVA, texts from the county, and weather channel alerts. Did you know there was a storm Thursday because I really couldn’t tell. It’s not like I got 18 notifications about it or anything.

I’m living in the area and we’ve had a lot of really bad storms lately

yeah, seriously. just have an online page where people can have settings for masonalert, checkboxes to enable/disable alerts for the fairfax, prince william, and arlington campuses so we don't have to receive all three if we only go to one or two

no escape for me, they come through text T.T

thank you, i appreciate it all the same <3

I get calls, texts and email, I never signed up for it how to I un subscribe

[https://ready.gmu.edu/masonalert/](https://ready.gmu.edu/masonalert/) &#x200B; Just log in and remove your phone and email.

holy shit, they CALL you? you poor soul

Helps when classes are delayed

Two GMU students heading to class with Blaze Pizza today

For you and... ME HEE eeeeeEEEEEeeEEEEHH

This made me chuckle

For you and me!

The Krusty Krab Pizza, is the pizza

Haha! This is so true!

lmao. I nearly got blown over on my way to Peterson today. Wind was ridiculous.

The pioneers used to ride these babies for miles

Can we not bully people... So, a picture was posted of someone lying down minding their own business in the JC. There were some fellow “patriots” that thought it would be funny to refer to him in a derogatory manner (ie calling him an incel, autistic, and a whale). This is a college sub reddit not a middle school’s. Posting about a fellow students in this manner is against university policy and also just childish, immoral, and unfunny. So maybe next time you decide to be edgy you can do it on r/tendies. Let’s try and keep this community as professional and non-toxic as possible.

Yeah, making fun of people gets on my nerves, especially "joking" about autism in a gross, demeaning way. I was diagnosed with asperger's as a child and grew up around the disabled. I know how hurtful it is to be targeted based on something you can't control. Like, how much of an a** are you to target people who can't defend themselves?! People at Mason can be so f'ing toxic and childish. These are the ppl that will go into worklife with an attitude of a ninth grader and make all their coworkers lives a living hell. Grow up. Please.

Thank you. I was appalled at that post.

Thanks for posting this. Someone took a photo and then posted it on the internet so that people could insult him because they thought what he did was weird/dumb. You know what's weird/dumb? Taking photos of people without their permission or knowledge, posting them on a subreddit _with school officials, employers, and prospective students_, and then insulting him by calling him fat, autist, incel, etc. without zero knowledge about this person beyond the photo. What kind of disgusting behavior is that? Some of y'all need to really stop and think before you act. EDIT: I find it incredible that `Can we not bully people...` is controversial. Apparently bullies who like criticizing others for their actions don't like being criticized for *their* actions.

While I agree that if you're in public, you're totally fair game, that doesn't make someone making fun of you any less of an asshole. People should be corrected, politely, for behavior that's odd so they can learn, but posting this junk on a *university subreddit* is just rude.

Thank you for posting this. A lot of us are thinking this and you had the nerve to say something about it. I think a baseline should be drawn, if it is something aatanas2 wouldn't post, don't post it.

Can i get a quick run down on what happened in this thread

[link to the post im raging at](https://www.reddit.com/r/gmu/comments/at8bn2/someone_come_get_your_boy_and_remind_him_that/?st=JSFUYBDH&sh=43873465)

Can we rename the gmu sub to sjwgmu

Holy shit there’s no wrong in making fun of someone doing dumb shit especially when they most likely know it’s going to draw attention

Holy shit there’s no wrong in making fun of someone who’s doing dumb shit knowing that it will most likely draw attention

Have some decency people. Even if this person was of sound mind and body that does not make it okay to be mean. Simple stuff we should know by now. It should be treated the same way as when you hold the door for someone. Its common courtesy and even more so a good way to live your life.

It's funny (and also unfortunate) because even professors definitely make fun of the mentally disabled students in their classes.

You are really trying to get people to join a sub that you made out of babyrage. It’s kind of cute. Uwu

I actual never called him that. If you would read back this thread I said that others did in the OP and thats all. I cant speak for the other commenters though.

I completely agree. I've noticed this immature attitude among most of the population at GMU. It is unfortunate. Reality hasn't hit them yet to understand that people can't help it if they are disabled. Mommy and Daddy are still paying for their school. They have never worked a day in their life so they continue to act like fools.

Glad people on here are speaking up about this stuff. Back when I was just getting out of high school my impression of GMU was one of a place that would just be an extension of high school/NOVA. My image of it as a school has improved, but my image of the student body not so much, and plenty of the people on this sub haven’t helped. Obviously immature people exist everywhere but I never got the same sense of it being so pervasive at VT.

Hilarious that you thought we had any decorum. Campus culture is dead anyways, let the marshmellow fans stay.

Not having decorum is not the same as being a jerk to someone who isn't doing anything. You can tell because a lot of the people shitting on the guy were doing so specifically because of a perceived breach of social contract or whatever. The key thing is to just make jokes that either punch up or self-deprecating ones rather than cheap digs at random kids

same thing happened to me (last semester i think) when someone posted a video recording of some guy walking barefoot in jc. A couple of the people in that thread got all uppity and entitled about "muh 1st amendment rights" and in my head i'm just like, wow... &#x200B; Sometimes just because you can do something, doesn't mean you should, especially when it's at the expense of someone else.

2019 outrage culture happened.

Snowflakes puttin' their nose into other people's business.

Shh, that's a microaggression

You literally don't know that. Also, "there's no wrong in making fun of someone" is a very bad, fifth grade bully-like take.

Wow you sound like I really nice guy. Maybe it’s against university policy to cyber bully. Way to propagate it mate. Im sure you feel good about letting that out.

Yeah this sub is home to pretty much every one of my IT professors. Its super sexist you think girls don’t browse reddit. Sad!

C’mon dude. OP clearly meant that some people have problems beyond their control and their behavior doesn’t fall within the normal social conduct. If someone, sound of mind, lays down like that in the middle of JC then I agree he deserves to be ripped on. But in this case, we don’t know what that guy is going through.

I agree with this guy. If he expects us to be respectful to him then he should conduct himself properly in public, else he will get criticism from the public.

Yeah it’s probs because you were the most toxic and uncultured member of our sub. Literally said “what are they gonna do fight me”. Listen kid, if you have to put chad in your username to give your self a strain of any sort of self confidence you should probably keep your mouth shut in debates. Have fun with HR when the realize you don’t know how to act like an adult.

You also didn’t get banned for debating, you were being rude. The one rule of this sub, which is literally in the side bar, is don’t be rude. So maybe before making some dumb post trying to defend yourself and attack me you realize you won’t win in this situation, and you own up to the mistake like a real chad would. Maybe GMUbrad would be a better name.

Its probably because most of us have been in classes that were ruined by people with mental disabilities. Sure they can't help it. That doesnt make them any less disruptive. People with disruptive disabilities should be in seperate classes.

You’re the guy that propagates inceldom. You refer to yourself as chad and you’re the one thats been posting the cs chad virgin memes. You are part of the problem. This is a general subreddit that our professors are apart of, so maybe the next time you wanna get a karma boost for your copypasta meme you stole from 4chan you can put it in the right subreddit. Also being a chad means you have the decency to not be a cyber bully.

Literally triggered. Mods plz ban him he was mean.

And then after that I said when they’re doing something stupid, a fifth grade bully-like take is picking on someone based off something they can’t change about themselves such as their height or attractiveness.

Who are you? The policy police? Fuck off people can say whatever they want about some dumbasses actions in public

Ya, the guy probably should have found a chair to sit in but it's not a big deal and definitely not one that warrants public shaming and if you're on the topic of respect it's more disrespectful (and creepy) to secretly take someone's picture without them looking just so you can post it online and laugh at them.

Has anyone else gotten this on their email?

I honestly wonder if COVID broke a lot of people's ability to smell themselves.

**FINALLY**. I didn't know how much longer we would have to deal with this s\*\*t but I guess someone finally took notice.

I got this too. Doesn't seem to be problematic tho. I think the solutions they offer are solid.

#engineeringstudents #CSstudents

Jesus guys, has it gotten that bad since I left? Keep yourselves together over there. There’s free showers on campus at all the gyms.

Just take a shower after working out and at least once a day. Learn to be part of society

Yeah they won’t care unless you directly and publicly call them out on it and even then it’s a maybe

i support this message cuz some of yall STINK

can’t say I disagree

I haven’t seen this, but I’m glad it’s in circulation. Yesterday, I got on the West Campus shuttle and there were two guys that probably bathed in cologne rather than showered. The hints of BO were there but the cologne was overwhelming. My allergies flared up and it was just awful. Side thought: I wonder if Lume would send samples to GMU?

I had a CS Lab that had 40-something students in it. I could fucking *taste* it. Computer engineering students, **please use deodorant**. Just because you have a broken sniffer doesn't mean everyone else does as well. Shower at least every other day, after every workout, and USE DEODORANT.

Aluminum deodorant is great

Cop some cologne 🙏

No, but that is kind of hilarious. No offense Everyone should take a shower though. It’s common sense

Not a student anymore but one year the tech focused career fair literally smelled like a bathroom. They need to start doing those outside

Lol the smelly kid in class? Does he smell like piss? Is he creepy? Is his name Robby? Or …some kind of “obby” name? And he doesn’t just smell like a hint of piss does he? Or a “smidgen” of piss….It smells like that kid was dipped in a VAT of piss. Like he woke up that morning and said, “whew! Bring on the piss!” And SOMEONE brought on the piss! I don’t know who would bring piss on….but….you can pretty much hire anybody on GOOGLE nowadays…just type in “piss painters” or something…I’m sure someone will come over…coat ya down….Put a sheet of piss on ya for a reasonable price.

these bili's cant shower?

they should put this on all the bulletin boards @ scitech

Sorry my fault

At Old Dominion is the same, most of the students smell like dirty ass, disgusting.

I get classrooms, but I don't understand complaining about body odor at the gym? Like yeah I stink, I'm getting my mf pump on...

is this really a thing these days hahaha

i know i got sick a few weeks ago and i have not been able to smell right since 😭

There were BO issues pre-COVID as well.

alum here, i assumed this was a shitpost op made at first. yall doing ok over there?

I was just about to say there goes the CS students.

name checks out

I don’t think it works at all actually

I agree. You know, For beginners, id reccomend looking at Afnan supremacy collectors edition. If you want a good fall cologne, id reccomend the most wanted by Azzaro or Khamarah by Lattafa. Armaf Club de Nuit Intense is also good. But none of these will hide your BO if you dont shower. These are just meant to compliment how you dress and look. My personal dailys are Afnan Supremacy Noir and Lapidus Black extreme. Sometimes ill bust out the Tom Ford Noir de Noir, but I also dont have any BO because I shower and use deodorant.

Please no, then it's just BO mixed with cologne 🤮

You can get a head-start on retraining a compromised sense of smell by smelling things which you *innately* know the smell of and bringing that scent memory to the forefront of your mind while doing so. So if you have a favorite fragrance or like the smell of your detergent/laundry...that's a good place to start. Even though I've *never* had a symptomatic case of COVID (seriously), I've made a daily ritual of smelling my body wash in the shower to make certain my nose is working.

It wasn't *nearly* as bad or prevalent, though.

Funny that CS students, and even later when they were employed as programmers (is that still a job name?) had the same reputation 40 years ago. Some things don't change.

This guy colognes too

Prada makes good cologne if you can afford it, and it’s the best, I’ll die on this hill. Prada Luna Rossa Black w/ the Woody Spice scent is my personal favorite.

Fair but once people start working out the line can blur pretty fast depending on the person

Ofcourse! I've been pulled too deep into the hole my brother.

Nah once u find out about Dior private line and guerlain it’s over

My First Semester at GMU. Fall Semester, 2017.

My first semester was also fall 2017. Man fuck COVID. It definitely sucks for the students starting at GMU right now but I also took a beating....I did not get to walk. No ceremony. No nothing :’( So keep your head up my fellow patriots. This pandemic has ruined it for everyone.

Ugh the old plaza. I miss it. Fuck construction. I don’t remember when it began but in sophomore year it really got congested and overwhelming. Now being a senior it’s still there and sometimes confusing to navigate.

Just wait until you graduate....nostalgia is gonna hit hard. Enjoy it while you can guys!

"Let me guess, your home?" "It was... ...and it was beautiful."

That was my first semester at GMU as well, makes me nostalgic for simpler times for sure.

Simpler times

Wow as freshman so much of this is unrecognizable to me

I know this is hard to believe, but I really do miss the busy campus. Fall 2017 was also my first semester, and I made so much music with my friends, and explored the new-to-me campus. I did go through a lot of shit that semester, but a part of me always has nostalgia for it. I miss the hangouts, campus parties, the trees (outside the JC), the record and poster popups, the live events, the block paintings, the club recruitment, hell I even miss Jorge :(

My first semester was Spring of the same year. The little things we took for granted then..

aw man, i miss when the plaza was open like this. my last time being on campus was last spring, when we had to navigate a maze here.

Fall 2019 was my first semester. Those were indeed simpler times

Ah, my first semester, looking back at it, it truly was the greatest year of life so far. I made so many connections and friends including my best friend. The campus was open, with no construction, and no COVID. I long for these days again. Maybe better days will come in the future, but I miss 2017-18 Mason. I often referred to this spot as Preacher Square. For those who didn't attend prior to construction, this is where preachers would often stand and yell. Shoutout to Jorge.

My first semester too! aw :’)

A glimpse into an old era

I recognize 3 people lol.

Best of luck

I miss George Pineapple.

I’m graduating this semester and we also are in the same boat with no ceremony and no walk. Definitely sucks.

First world problems. But congratulations on successfully graduating! On the bright side, you avoided trying to stay awake for the ceremony and potentially hazardous walk. Seriously, if I have to sit through one again, God help me.

I’m glad that they now got rid of the terrible construction. This construction right now is not bad at all, it only blocks off Robinson Hall B.

I remember you! Use to love seeing you and Willy playing music all around campus! Use to brighten up my day! You made Mason seem lively and I appreciate you! Keep drumming!

So weird GMU doesn’t have a ceremony. We have one at W&M but only the graduating students, no family lol.

Ok, you didn't like it. That doesn't mean someone else may find value in a commencement.

Yeah it’s not as terrible. Glad it is all gone. Some stuff hasn’t really changed throughout the years. Like the old apartment buildings that they tore down that plot hasn’t changed much. It’s easier to walk around on campus but years back I would struggle a lot.

I feel like that is the typical senior experience. We become busy with internships, most of the hard requirements are in the past, and some of us no longer have an overloaded schedule. That freedom has become alien to us.

Thank you so much! Yeah after Willy left it was hard to get out there, but of course with COVID I really can't do it all! Hopefully I'll be able to do something in the near future!

Calm down. I never implied anyone else couldn't enjoy it. While I do understand its value, I certainly would not do it again. Take it for face value.

Last year before covid, it was bad. Literally the whole campus is cover with construction. It should be all done by the 2022 I believe with the rest of Horizon Hall being built.

Calm down? Lmao. Didn't come off as angry, but ok. At face value, you came off as a dick. OP is upset that they can't attend commencement and you go "FIRST WORLD PROBLEMS!! YOU MAY FALL AND IT SUCKS LUL". The real first world problem is complaining about having to attend commencement after having the blessing of attending and graduating university, something half the globe will never even have the opportunity to do.

Oh yes really bad. At times I didn’t realize and I go for classes to the art and design building and they even blocked that path once. It was like a meme of how different areas was being blocked off due to construction.

lol obviously you read between the lines as well as I do. Sure you can read it that way but that was not my intent. And I agree in that my complaint is just as first world as I deemed theirs. Although that term really is out-of-date.

This is David Verburg, Olympic gold medalist and GMU class of 2013 graduate

No. This is the average GMU student saving a starship

David Verberg is a great guy. He did an autograph signing at a Patriots game a few months after he won his Olympic gold medal and let my daughter wear it for a photo

I enjoy reading books.

Thats awesome

the guy behind the camera

Wrong. I'm the turtle (that graduated from Mason in 2013).

I was thinking outside the shell

Raccoon digging through trash at 5:00am

GMU raccoons are a legacy family. We used to have one by Theater that would get fed by students… super friendly.

Critters gotta eat

I want to know how are you out and about in campus at 5AM

OP is studient af being up at 5am to study🫡🫡 inspirational

i was walking back to my car last night around 10pm near Lot A. I crossed the street but these people behind me kept going straight, past the trash cans. There were 2 raccoons that ran out of the trash and scared these people. I just heard rustling noises and gasps then see one of the raccoons head poke up nearby the trees border lmfaoooo

I saw a group of five strolling through the parking lot at 2 AM once. One of them tripped and rolled down into a bush 💀

THAT’S MY SON! That’s my boooooy!!

Trash panda recycling at your service.

It's kind of cool to see wildlife so active on campus once the people leave, kind of like Toy Story or Life of Dogs

Yea it didn’t seem surprised that I was so close to it, probably got used to being close to people

Same. In the 80s

Founders. As well respected as the Mertens.

To the guy who was walking on campus with his laptop open and focused on the screen instead of watching where he was going: Hope you pass your midterms bro -and safely crossed the road. 🙏🏼💀 locked tf in

Reminds me of the iMac Kid. In 2021, there was a kid who had an iMac AIO hooked up to a battery or something and carried it EVERYWHERE, he went to ikes and set it up, went to the JC, had it set up. He would carry it around and had it on the log in page.

Bro is locked all the way in with the studies 🤣🤣🤣

My fault gang profesor was doing a zoom meeting and I had to meet my group on campus.

I respect the grind

Are you mad at bro or just surprised that he was that locked in?

Y'all's generation has the tools for it. Way more locked in than we millennial cavemen

Midterms ? It’s only being 4 weeks

OMG i remember this, wonder how he is doing

he even brought it to southside 😂 memories

Sounds like my roommate, he even took that thing into the bathroom

I admire the dedication, and I aspire to be like him

We’re currently on the fifth week of the semester, and the midterm evaluation period began this Monday.

some of my courses are only 8 weeks long, I already had 1 midterm it's kinda crazy

Yes! He had some suspicious looking anime playing max brightness too

I was going to say, I always remembered seeing him @ the JC playing some sus anime loud af 😭

Oh hell naw

Lol someone stole a shuttle

Lmaoo GTA 6:GMU edition

Isn't that the guy from two and a half men

So, there's a big ass shuttle with a big ass gmu logo on it driving around nova? I wonder what this guy's goal is exactly....

And those buses breakdown all the time.

Maddest of lads.

did he take all the passengers to there destinations for free?

Whew I thought that was me. Just a doppelganger.

Yo, is that MatPat?

At least he wore a mask

Wait it said a limousine bus, I don't think a mason shuttle is considered a limousine bus lol.

Good thing he’s wearing a neck gator that’s been shown to be worse than no mask at all, while simultaneously not covering his nose. Top notch stuff

Is this the dude who did the piazza thing?

Charlie SHeen?

But he has a dick nose hanging out

Well, he wrote the mask incorrectly, so now we can see most of his face hanging out. It would’ve been harder to identity him if he wore it correctly.

It 1000% is lol EDIT: they’re subcontracted by Reston Limo

In an empty bus...

I think that dude was named Jain.

To be fair he is in what appears to be an empty bus. No point wearing a mask in your car when you're by yourself.

You wear a mask when you are driving in your car by yourself? I wear glasses so I take my mask off ASAP when I get in my car (they fog up).

Online Classes Right Now...

Let's be honest, it's 75% dying inside and 0.01% of productivity

I came into my first semester here at Mason full of confidence. Now, I'm always stressing out about the work.

I’ve never seen something more accurate

Im in this picture and I don’t like it.

The struggle is real

I really haven't encountered technical issues in any capacity, but maybe I'm just lucky. People were definitely plenty distracted by phones in IRL classes so I wouldn't fault the online model for failing to eliminate the possibility of distractions. 🤷

Unfortunately, orange should be much bigger for chem department 😔

Maybe. My experience has been more on the students end (mostly with mics and cameras, disconnects, or issues with screen sharing acting weird on different devices), although the teachers are having plenty of issues too. The GMU issues seem mostly with particular software which is not always used in a lot of classes. But certainly its a different balance for each person and each class.

Guess you have been lucky. The stories of technical issues on all sides are everywhere (both here on Reddit and elsewhere) and every single class I have constantly have folks with mic or camera issues, plenty of issues sharing screens, bouncing between devices, and so much more. It feels like every class wastes a huge chunk of time trying to wait for folks to sort out issues or attempting to work through issues to progress forward. But yea phone distraction is real for many lol. You can just see folks eyes drifting lol.

Well, I'm a CS (computer science) major so everybody is perhaps more computer-literate than average? (I do not mean that in a condescending way or anything.) Could explain why the tech issues aren't too bad most of the time. It does suck that everyone else is having such a bad time though.

> Well, I'm a CS (computer science) major so everybody is perhaps more computer-literate than average? (I do not mean that in a condescending way or anything). Could explain why the tech issues aren't too bad most of the time. No that does make sense. Obviously if folks are studying CS one would hope they would be better with computers but also quicker to resolve issues lol. Other departments seem to be, by far, more of a disaster lol.

Yeah, that makes sense. 😂 Sounds awful lol

They climbin stairs now

Machine Learning at it’s finest

That poor girl just layed out on the floor on the internet forever

He do be delivering doe 😳

It looks like someone just picked the little dude up like we gotta you workin on wheel day man

[ELEVATE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-BhKu3XXi7E)

They have these things called elevators you know. I don't know how they would operate one but if they can enter buildings at all it can't be that much harder to enter an elevator

Lmao they are evolving. We’re fucked

Honestly always kinda wondered why asshole people dont just kidnap the damn things and throw them away. Like who cares if it's GPS tracked, it's at the bottom of Mason pond

Lmao I tried to zoom in to get her out of the pic but that failed so i just tried to cover her

Theres no elevator in the rac

Apparently they scream bloody murder if you try to mess with them, and are equipped with some serious speakers. Plus there's the constantly- recording cameras...

How do people in wheelchairs get to the top floor then? I thought all the buildings in GMU would be handicap accessible

They scream incredibly loud. Saw one dude outside the JC try to force open one that needed to be fed to deliver, and it was so LOUD like the loudest screech Ive heard. The dude ran off back to his friends and the poor Chipotle guy had to stop it from screaming and opened it for delivery.

I’ve been going there for years but maybe I just havn’t seen it

I use to work there. It's next to the offices in the back.

How I sleep after seeing people’s rigorous course schedules, even tho I already graduated & don’t gotta worry about it anymore

Alumn here — I still lurk on this sub from time to time lol

How I’m gonna sleep the next two weeks before this rat race begins again 🤣 only two more semesters to go…!!!!

Sleep well, Homie.

Only 1 more semester of suffering 😩

So you haven't gotten to the part in your life where you start to have dreams you are back in school, registered for a class, forgetting you registered, and then only remembering about it during Finals. Because this happens to me a lot and from what I can tell, happens to other people, too.

I am applying to grad school so I have to ask for letter of recs, do the essay 😭🥲i already got rejected once so….

I graduated and am halfway through a grad degree, and man I do not miss those schedules. Grad school is maybe the same level of stress (a tad less when not taking into account dissertation) but much less time spent in the classroom stressing.

i’d rather be worried about classes than finding a job and working 😭

Final semester of grad school. College sucks.

Help me get karma to ask Qs here

Yeah but now we gotta work…fellow grad here

George Mason really do be letting anyone in

Mason parking desperate for cash for years yet they never care about this stuff lol

89.2% as of 2020. Assert dominance - park parallel and close to their driver-side door.

I remember people getting wait listed when I was in high school. I was born too early. XD

Average Honda Civic EX driver

NVCC parking has come to mason

Leave a note saying “Sorry i hit your car, I dont think it’s noticeable” 😈

Can parking services ticket for this?

Action parking

[liiiike a glove](https://media4.giphy.com/media/tp4dm1ptNnQ76/giphy.gif)

even my mom can park better than this

Must be from Miami

That ain’t even a GMU thing, that’s just a nova thing

Gmu parking still gives me ptsd

Literally passed this car on my way to class I wished a car parked so close to the driver side door they couldn't access it.

Right, back when I got in ppl were getting curved left n right …

They better lmfao

They can. I’ve called them for a lot of other atrocious parking jobs and they always have a ticket.

My grandma can park better than this and she's a bunch of ashes in a jar.

Time lapse of lot R getting plowed

Idk why but I find this very soothing

Does this mean I have to go to class tomorrow :/

Put on the King of the Hill opening in the background

r/oddlysatisfying

Wish id get plowed like that

The one thing we didn’t ask for but desperately needed

:(........ yes

Nope just got the email my labs are cancelled >:) yesss

GOood!! >:)

To professors adding assignments If you are a professor and you are adding mandatory discussion board questions, online quizzes, etc on top of the already existing syllabi because “classes are online”: Fuck you.

Lowkey hoping they announce pass/fail system this week...

It really feels like they just discovered they can do this stuff and are doing it ALL now. Kinda like when you first discover PowerPoint transitions. Star fade, crossfade, origami bird, *fade to white.*

Yea I agree, its one thing if they are replacing things but if they are adding things on top of all the stuff already assigned thats messed up.

Out of all my professors only one of them knows how to actually use a computer, this is gonna be a tough semester

SAY IT LOUDER FOR THE PEOPLE IN THE BACK

Amen! I’m annoyed that we have now db to do for my acct class and that we must reply to at least one classmate. Like seriously, I’m just gonna say “hi blah blah, wow I totally agree with everything you stated in your post!.” Done! I aint gonna sit, think, relate concept to any of this sh*t.

There's an emergency faculty senate meeting this week to discuss grading.

Here come the people saying “gRoW uP” “iT’s NoT tHaT bAd”

I have 1 class where we have to do all these discussions boards. It's a tuesday/Thursday class and one is now due on Friday. We have to reply and then reply to someone else's reply. Fuck that shit

I just hope they announce it before selective withdrawal deadline

i’m super frustrated about this but the opposite also sucks; my astronomy prof just got rid of two exams, so now our entire grade is made up of the exam we already took, and our final. i bombed the first exam so no matter what I do i’m fucked in that class.

Discussion boards I can handle. But online quizzes.... TWICE A WEEK.... heck.

They're probably waiting for second midterms. When (not if) they are well below expectations they will implement it

Are you an econ major? 😂

IF YOU ARE A PROFESSOR AND YOU ARE ADDING MANDATORY DISCUSSION BOARD QUESTIONS, ONLINE QUIZZES, ETC ON TOP OF THE ALREADY EXISTING SYLLABI BECAUSE "CLASSES ARE ONLINE": FUCK YOU!!!!

Which day this week?

I couldn't disagree with a username like that lmao

If YoU dO yOuR wOrK, yOu CaN pAsS! I imagine they don’t leave the house. They live and breath their studies.

What is this whole thread about? We are missing 3 hours of class each week now. These are mew ways to make that up. Duh.

The moral thing to do would be to extend the unrestricted withdrawal so people can choose to just pull out of this semester if they need to until the world stabilizes.

My stat professor has been unable to retrieve a portion of the classes first exam and so he's just going to count exam 2 double for those people. Mason really needs to move to pass fail or universal pass.

Seems idiotic to wait which means Mason might actually do

Now that the whole campus is shut down, even professors have to teach from home! I think in the best interest for everyone, they should just announce it this week so that students and professors are less stressed.

Crim major :')

They were about that quarantine life way before the rest of us had to.

My professor didn't take any work away, but now we have to watch the videos (about 2 hours for the first week back) and attend normal class times online. He's literally having an online collab time setup for questions instead of lecturing. He's recording the lecture and we're required to watch it in our free time, BEFORE scheduled class and attend the collab to ask questions. This is not what I am paying money for because this is not how I wanted to learn upper level math. "What is this whole thread about?" People not happy with paying thousands of dollars for the school to drag their feet in a pandemic, waiting until it's too late to make a contingency plan and then getting even more course work for a class that's now online with a teacher that isn't equipped to teach online. ALL DURING A GLOBAL PANDEMIC with people losing jobs and businesses closing down. You sound like a jackass with your dismissive attitude.

Maybe some partial refund at least...so those who want to take it in person could pay a bit less

Change it off peaceful

Count me in!

I’ll be on later

Roger that, I’ll get some of the boys on

make it anarchy and i'm in

I've always wanted to see Mason in Minecraft. Now somebody make a map for Garry's Mod!

server needs to be updated?

gimmie mod, ill build good turtle

I don't play Minecraft, but would it be possible to set fire to the parking garages on this server? 'Cause that might make me pick up Minecraft, finally.

OMG cringe normie

I'm down!!! This is awesome:)

It's not peaceful. Just spawn is.

just let people have fun dude

No you both

You do realize I'm joking right?

honestly, from the way you said it - it could’ve gone either way. however most people would’ve taken it as “not a joke”

Patrick NO!

meal plan is absolute horseshit. there's barely anything good to eat everyday.

But we get food delivery robots, so it's worth it.

What is the meal plan? I'm off campus so I have no clue.

As someone that started in 2008 and graduated in 2012. I saw Chow Hall be shut down and the opening of South Side. It was glorious when it first opened and the meal plans weren’t forced. During finals we would go to South Side, get a booth, and study and eat for hours. From 2008 - 2012 I saw about 15-16 building go up. Fenwick was still 2 stores on one side and 4 on the other. I went to graduate school at Mason in 2015 and it completely blew my mind how much it changed even in those 3 years.

Does anybody who whines about construction consider the fact that if they never did construction during the school year half the buildings would either not exist or be in awful condition?

whats the deal with mealplans? I graduated a while back and it was pretty decent then. Is it all the good places don't accept mealplans?

I can’t tell wether this is a /S or not.

If you live in anything less than an apartment, you're required to have a meal plan.

I think it's gotten worse but when I came in if you were living on campus as a freshman you had to buy one, no options

imo, part of the issue is how slow it seems at times. Once they started tearing down Robinson it took them like a month to tear it down completely. Why not do it over winter break so we at least don't have dust in the air? There's also the fact that they're doing so much construction at once. There's Robinson, the path from Skyline to the JC, the area near Mason/Buchanan, and the area near the theater building. I get they want to get as much done as possible but I think it's too much.

That doesn’t mean we can’t complain about it. It may be at its worst now because a lot of it is being done in the middle of campus causing detoured routes to class and narrow walkways

The dining halls are just ass and bonus funds only get you so far.

I graduated 2015, but I remember they were starting to force on campus students to buy unlimited plans for Southside/the other buffet place near presidents park. Which is horseshit for anyone who would rather cook

Seriously? Dang, things must've changed since I've graduated. That sucks (I knew a good deal of people who just wanted to cook instead).

all freshmen and also sophomores (who don't have a kitchen) are required to purchase an unlimited meal plan to the dining halls. this costs (currently) 2,145 dollars a semester without purchasing the required bonus dollars that add 100-500 dollars.

The area around Buchanan was supposed to be down earlier but they ran into problems with subterranean shit, I think

A meal plan can be as little as 25 meals for the whole semester, which I think is like 100-200 dollars. But that's still 100-200 you *have* to pay.

Yeah, I don't like the whole "you're forced to buy X thing" approach. Kinda glad I don't have to go back to there in the future.

Isn’t that only for Juniors and Seniors, I believe Freshman and Sophmores still have to get the unlimited one unfortunately

Nah. Only freshman have to get Independence. Sophomores have all the options available.

I think if you don’t have a kitchen, you need independence though

That wasn't what I experienced in housing selection but IDK. I went with Liberty anyways since I like chipotle more than ike's lmao.

Fr only good thing at Ike’s for me is the sandwiches lol, but I’ll look into it since I might be wrong

The sandwiches are only good when Gloria is working. Otherwise they're hot garbage. Well... Sometimes they're just regular temp garbage since the toaster never works lmao.

I made a browser extension to skip that stupid Information Release page! I've been here for a couple years now. A week ago I finally decided I was done clicking "Do not ask me again" every couple hours, [and it looks like I'm not alone](https://www.reddit.com/r/gmu/comments/1nixlwp/can_we_agree_that_this_option_is_a_lie/). So I bit the bullet and spent a couple hours learning how to make a browser extension that would remove the problem permanently. After a week of waiting, I now have it approved and listed on the [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/stopaskinggmu/) and [Edge](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/stopaskinggmu/memjepmledaojhndmlkcjopkikmlokpb) stores. If you want to look at the code (I promise I'm not stealing your data lol) or install it in another browser like Chrome, you can check out [the GitHub page](https://github.com/KellanClark/stopaskinggmu/tree/main).

Now this is true innovation. Fuck everything else people have learned or done here. This is true peak

Not all heroes wear capes…

Sometimes the simplest code is the most useful. Thank you so much for this!

We deserve more people like this in the world

This is golden

Hooray! You are a saint!

Hell Yeah Thank you!

Finally installed on Opera after trying to remember to for a while. This is a damn godsend lol ty for your service

How the administration imagine it will be

"I was gonna go hate crime some minorities but my syllabus said 'Racism is against the university values' so I stopped"

𝅘𝅥𝅯 𝅘𝅥 𝅘𝅥𝅯 𝅘𝅥 *Don't be racist, I am a syllabus* 𝅘𝅥𝅯 𝅘𝅥 𝅘𝅥𝅯 𝅘𝅥

is that the sex offender shuffle

Did they arrest the CEO of racism?

Who would win, a class of racists or one syllabi boi?

$5 million well spent. Who knew Syllabi where the real source of racism

easiest way to stop being racist? don’t start lmao

Well boys we did it, racism is no more!

No it's the students after an anti-racism statement

Meredith Ashley Drottar (‘10), 03/04/1988-01/15/2025 It is with deep sorrow that we announce that our beloved partner, sister, aunt, friend, and Phan, Meredith Ashley “Doc Otter” Drottar stepped through the portal at 6:02 pm January 15 at St. Mary’s Hosptial in Grand Junction. Meredith is survived by her father Tim Scally, her sister Meghan Thompson, her partner Timothy “Pepe” Edington, her nieces Cheyanne, Cassadey, and Anna, her nephews Simon and Codah, and her beloved dogs Bodhidharma (Bodhi) and the Lumpy Space Duchess (Ducky). She was preceded in death by her mother Debbie (46) and sister Morgan Jenner (43). Meredith lived a life out of movie and it started when she was born at home on March 4, 1988 in Leesburg, VA. Her adventure really ramped up 5 days laters when the family packed up and moved cross country to Fort Collins, CO. Meredith would spend her entire childhood in Fort Collins and would go on to graduate from Rocky Mountain High School. Despite working and helping her sisters with their children, she found the time to volunteer as a peer to peer crisis counselor. This would be the start of an adult life spent helping others. She would overcome a difficult childhood that saw her lose her mother at 14 and become the first person in her family to attend college. She attended George Mason University where she earned a bachelor’s degree in social work. While at George Mason Meredith began working at Trader Joe’s. She worked for 15 years at Trader Joe’s in stores from Reston, VA to Denver, CO with stops in Albuquerque and Salt Lake City in between, leaving a litany of lasting lifelong friendships. While living in Albuquerque, she met Timothy, a crusty, 1.0 veteran, who would become her companion and partner for the rest of her life. She would later attend Capella University where she earned a Master’s degree in counseling. After two years of clinical work, she would go on to open her own counseling practice, Yellow Sky Counseling. Meredith’s life was dedicated to helping others and this was reflected in her choice to be a therapist and the passion she put into it. Meredith was passionate about many issues and causes, including smashing the patriarchy, reproductive rights, and gay and trans rights. Meredith loved music and going to concerts, particularly Phish and Dead and Company, and recently started playing the ukulele. Other hobbies and passions included hiking, whitewater rafting, creating art, writing, reading as many books as she could get her hands on, and spending Saturday night by a fire listening to crunchy jams with Timothy and her dogs. In the last few years, Meredith's life seemed to reach new heights. Her counseling practice was flourishing and she purchased her first house in Cortez, CO. Meredith attended her first Phish concert on September 5, 2021. On the way into the venue Meredith ate a Chomp meat stick. Well, wouldn’t you know it, that night the band came out of Catapult and launched into Meatstick, and despite it being her first show, she did the dance perfectly. She attended her final show on August 29, 2024. She had planned to attend the entire Dick’s run, but sadly tragedy struck and her sister Morgan passed away in a motorcycle accident the next day and she missed the last 3 shows. In between her first show and last Meredith saw 14 shows and enjoyed every single one. She almost got to do it all, Dick’s, a festival, and going on tour. She was planning on attending her first YEMSG and New Year’s Eve shows this coming December. Meredith never really had a crew, just her partner and Light Buddy, Timothy, with whom she attended all her shows. Her favorite jams included Carini, Fluffhead, Harry Hood, Say It To Me S.A.N.T.O.S., and Sand. The two songs Meredith was chasing at the time of her passing were Lengthwise and Makisupa Policeman. A private service for family will be held on January 23 at Goes Funeral Home in Fort Collins, CO and will be followed by a public viewing. A Celebration of Life open to the public will be held January 25 at a location to be determined. The family asks that in lieu of flowers, donations be made to either the Mariposa Fund, the Trevor Project, and/or the Divided Sky Foundation.

She sounds like a really cool person. Sorry for your loss.

Rest in peace, Meredith

Shocked to see her face on my page, I knew her and chatted with her a bunch in college in various classes and such, you’re dancing with the spirits now.

I'm so sorry for your loss. Sounds like she really knew how to enjoy her life!

Sorry for your loss. I also lost a friend to suicide and I have to graduate GMU without him. It really hurts to see this.

Rest in peace.

Rest in peace man 🙏🤲📿

RIP Meredith!

R.I.P Meredith!

May she rest in peace ❤️

Rest in peace.

May she rest in peace and forever live in Hailey’s comet. Peace and love 💕

I am so sorry for your loss. She is gone too early.

Sorry for your loss.

Just think how good the music is now for her.shes doing just fine.

Oh no! I just looked her up out of nowhere and found this. I worked with Meredith at Trader Joe's in Reston a lifetime ago. She was wonderful. I'm so sorry for your loss.

Sorry for the loss, I’ve never met this person but even though we probably wouldn’t have gotten along (different ideologies). I’m sure she was a good person especially if she’s getting kind wishes like the ones I’m seeing in the comments! God Speed! ❤️

She was the coolest and she truly treasured her time and friendships made during her years at Mason.

Thank you for those kind words. She spoke fondly and often of her time at Mason.

She really did. She was a ball of fun and I was just a guy smart enough to recognize that and jump on the ride.

Hers was this thing that was like an aneurysm and they had no way of knowing it was there until something went wrong.

It was this thing that was like an aneurysm.

Thank you so much for your kind words. She truly loved all the friends she made at Trader Joe’s and used her time there to spring board to great things.

I’m very sorry for your loss.

Losing a friend to Aneurysm hurts really bad as well. The hardest part is letting them go and finding peace.

Saw a fox kill a squirrel finally saw a fox on campus yay 😃

This is the only fox news I need

That dude ran past me yesterday

Oh nooo, he ended up getting him! I saw the fox try a couple of times, the squirrel ended up getting away 2-3 times. Bro really had to work for that meal I took a photo of the fox getting ready to attack, but I was too far away, so it was really blurry. I didn’t want to be his next meal, so I kept my distance lmaooo

most auspicious

Spotify... Play Circle of Life

What does the fox say?

I just remembered that I saw a dead squirrel at Wilcons Plaza last week. I think I now know who did it lol

Fox don't give a shit https://youtu.be/4r7wHMg5Yjg?si=YAOTyYc7OHk-R15u

Everyone needs to eat. Probably has kits.

I miss my wife, Tails.

rabies animal control be lurking

Why hike the Virginian Appalachias when we got nature right here?

Om nom nom. At least it wasn't someone's pet squirrel. Reminds me of when Ben Franklin wrote about poor Mungo. https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Franklin/01-19-02-0202

I've seen a lot of roughed up squirrels on campus lately. Bloody, chunks of fur taken. Guess it's this guy's doing

I been telling you guys for days. WE NEED TO GO ON A HUNT!

Careful, heard he’s known to kill.

Ah nostalgia, reminder of simpler times

Here's what the baby geese look like now

I am very much invested in this

Damn, they got big fast, or I just have a really bad concept of time

So floofy!!!!

STOPPP I AM LIVING FOR THE GEESE CONTENT

I love the goose updates

How close have you been getting? And they LET you get close?

Nice picture

Awww if only they could stay babies forever

Not sure how accurate this is, but I think there’s one family with five baby geese and another family (the rooftop geese) with six babies. Could be wrong, but that’s what I think I’ve seen a handful of times.

its possible theyre two different goose families...

VERY close! The adults are a lot more chill with being close, some of the little ones started running away as you can see in the pic

There are two goose families, this one and one with younger chicks. They are definitely still growing pretty fast though!

So, it’s one of THOSE days.

The mason experience be hitting different

Do none of these people have anything better to do Just go home and let me have my peace and quiet

I almost didn't recognize Horizon in this shot

That lion is the sigil of house lannister in game of thrones. (They're the one's who are incestuous 🤭). Just gives me another reason to laugh at these fools.

why do they + other conservative groups keep showing up on campus? is there any way for mason to prevent them from being here cuz all they do is harass students

The bagpipes made me crack up!

Glad I’m online only today. Jeez these guys freak me out. Like I’m a Christian but cmon dude. Cmon…

I pointed out how all those guys were men talking about an issue that is about people with uteruses. So dumb

I remember back in 2011 they'd have a huge booth set up outside Robinson with graphic imagery. A pastor would occasionally show up outside the JC quad to scream against evolution and abortion. Some things never change.

A little annoying to be sure, but I'll be honest the dudes belting out off-key musical numbers to "counterprotest" were no less obnoxious. All in all these events are always fun to watch and silently chuckle at if that's your thing.

I swear this campus is way too open

What’s worse them or the voting people at this point. I just tell them Im a felon and can’t vote

Bro just said that lion is from GOT

Bro lolol good catch

Says the actual fool. Thx for the laugh

Nah tbh I find them annoying as hell but the students do it to themselves. If people just ignored them instead of forming the mobs that these groups crave it would look very different

They Annoy students, yes. But they don't technically harass anyone. As long as it's a public campus and they don't go chasing people, all we can do is ignore them.

Did they harass anyone? If they did, you should report and the university will toss them out. Mostly, they know the rule and stay within it which makes it hard

This is the US, Mason is public property. Whether you agree with what they say or not, they have a right to assemble and peaceably protest as per the Constitution.

The bagpipes actually sounded kinda good, but ho boy that child on the trumpet was almost as bad as the message they were trying to spread.

Yeah a lukewarm one

I know the symbol more than likely did not originate from a TV show, but I happen to be rewatching and thought the connection was funny lol. Lighten up and appreciate the silly things!

One of the guys from the group outside Southside last week was singling people out to yell at so yes they’re harassing peopt

You're the dude with the bagpipes huh?

Anyone can get into the campus is what I’m trying to say. The people protesting aren’t Mason students right?

Also - there’s a difference between fools of this world and fools according to Christ. And I’m confident that I’m nowhere near a fool of this world. And I hope the same for you!

That’s actually awesome I’m glad. Laughter is good for the soul, Tony Cheese. However, laughter is only temporary happiness - you only find true joy in Jesus and I genuinely hope you find that <3

No. Abortion is murder. I’m truly so sorry for you

A lukewarm Christian

I imagine they are. If not, they're probably just volun-told to post up places cuz they're young, in which case that's way more sad

I'm confident the 11th commandment wasn't "Thou shalt be a righteous asshat on reddit" but I could be wrong. I was raised religious but it's been a while

Abortion only became murder to evangelicals in the late 1970s and early 1980s with Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell realizing it was a way to galvanize an alliance with Catholics to form the religious right and expand their influence culminating in the election of Ronald Reagan. Abortion for the vast majority of the world and people is not murder and Roe v Wade had a good distinction of the point of fetal viability being the right point for when restrictions could take effect. If you believe Abortion is murder that's fine but don't enforce what you and your beliefs on the rest of society.

Show me where God said that. I'll wait.

Lol I’m not doing this today

God doesn’t think I’m an asshat, He does call me righteous though (as well as all believers) only because of His sacrifice on the cross that destroyed the power of sin in us. Call me what you want, I’ve heard far worse

That’s good. Means I’m not conforming to the sinful nature of this world that most ppl are caught up in ya know. I’d rather be considered odd any day instead of one of this upside down world. This isn’t my home anyways and honestly, that’s a huge compliment as a Jesus follower - cause He too was considered “odd” John 15:18 <3

Isaiah 5:20

Psalm 139:13. God purposefully has plans for every life on Earth. We, as humans (who are NOT God), do NOT have the God-given right to put our own decisions before His. Take it up with God if you have a problem w that but I stand by the faithful and true Word of the Lord.

I figured. That’s how lukewarms are ig. Sad

>I’ve heard far worse Now THAT I believe

Numbers 5:11-31 Is quite literally a tutorial for how to perform abortion.

Recent events have made this accurate

Bro, I don’t want to start any rumors, but I heard, for breakfast, Mason Police eats a bowl of nails WITHOUT ANY MILK

What happened

New police recruits aren’t supposed to be giving out warnings, they’re supposed to be practicing tickets so campus police will be the biggest dicks.

My drilla 🤙

Just a little reminder for some of our frats

Thank god I'm in a dorm so I don't have to worry about anyone throwing parties and spreading the 'rona throughout my entire building. ........right?

I like how on these types of posts there’s always the one literal baboon who tries to say “fuck the virus” or whatever and then their shit gets downvoted to hell

Fuck this shit dude. Asig wants to throw a party and the rest of campus wants to attack all of Greek life for asig’s stupidity. Fuck no we’re not throwing parties. Y’all shouldn’t have to worry since most of the people on this subreddit stay in their dorm rooms 24/7 to begin with. Edit: too bad these dudes don’t come to Mason. They’d be invited once shit is over.

why are you snitching on parties? oh right, covid

Damn... I respect that... that being said if any of you are interested pikapp is having a banger Saturday LETS RAGE😤😤😤😤😏😏😏😏🥳🥳🥳🥳

We can only hope...

As soon as people start drinking and partying, you know for a FACT people will be falling down all over other people, ripping those masks off to "breathe" and go smoke, and trying to get frisky. And don't get me started on those who don't pay attention to limits then suddenly gotta puke everywhere. "Social distancing" at a frat party. What a joke!😂

Tho it prolly won’t happen just yet, COVID crisis and stupidity of frats during this time might finally get colleges to pull the plug on Greek Life lol. I feel like GL is hated more and more every year and colleges honestly wanna get rid of them these days, but can’t exactly. And pretty much no one outside of Greek Life has any sort of positive view on it either. From what I’ve seen, either you love it because you’re in it, or you hate it.

Lol we wouldn’t go even if we were invited to your pandemic parties.

The requirements to get into a frat party is literally just to be a girl, which I am, so I get the insight and will take full advantage of it.

Yes. They are actually fraternities on campus that hold parties. Hopefully they won’t be doing any of that this school year.

VCU student here (but I don’t stay on campus), we got word that a bunch of freshmen were partying in the dorms and that there are 8 confirmed cases linked to a party that happened in the freshman dorms. Also I believe the campus has 25 cases that we know of so far.

“Social distancing” at a frat party where they invited a sorority into the same house and everyone has an excuse to not use a mask lol

Shit maybe get to know the people in it. The majority of people I’ve seen who hate Greek life are ones who’ve never engaged or experienced it to begin with. Some people have genuine bad experiences that have happened with Greek life, but the vast majority are just people who’ve never actually experienced it themselves. Colleges also won’t get rid of us unless they have to. We pay them too much money.

Hope you get expelled for putting people’s lives at risk for a stupid party where you take advantage of freshmen girls and rape them 🙃🙃🙃🙃

So far some of them have been, but the more respectable frats are holding off.

Well that’s the thing, with COVID, this might be their excuse to getting rid of it. And with regards to Greek life, it’s mainly the *frats* who have the shit reputation. Sororities don’t have as bad as a reputation and are known for their community service engagement and such. Meanwhile frats are known as date rape central that also manages to get pledges killed and damage property. Along with them being mostly white republican dudes with money and barely any diversity.

Fraternities suck and this is a big part right here. Almost like ACAB tbh. They do shit like date rape girls at frat parties and then their buddies cover for them.

Shit my fraternity is pretty diverse with several Muslim brothers and our President is Pakistani. Not to mention I voted for Bernie in the primaries. We also have to do community service, it’s mandated by schools. But hey, stereotypes are always the way to go I guess. Edit: lmao people downvoting for being angry we don’t fit the stereotypes. Y’all fucking pathetic.

You hit the nail on the head, too bad the dude was a coward and deleted his reply.

I actually had seen his reply, but when I went to respond to him he deleted it lol. I tried to say “imagine unironically using a term for people who choose not to be part of Greek life. And to top it all off, ‘geed’ sounds like a word that bullies use in middle/high school movies”.

cant get better then those dank retweets and likes

Took a lot of classes in that building.

The view from the other side by sub one is even better

Dang, I actually liked robinson. Had classes there and was a kinda nice to have quiet classrooms over lecture halls. Why is that being torn down? What are they replacing it with?

R.I.P to a real one.

Are they getting rid of both A and B? I haven’t been on campus since 2008 - took almost 97% of my classes there (anthro major)

Bittersweet.

This makes me so happy, that building needed to GO

I have never even been in that building lol

I need to do a visit back on campus, I didn't know they were tearing it down.

Oh no, its not even that old though?

As Keanu would say, "whoa!"

Damn thats where IT106 & 206 were!

I guess it’s too late now to go pick up my pen

I remember taking ENGH 302 in that building lol. Good times.

Tell me about it 😂

Shot a student film in that building.

I’ll try and pass by today to take a look at it lol

A is already gone, replaced by Horizon hall, I might be wrong though since I joined GMU as Horizon Hall was being made

Sign the Petition To Make GMU Fall 2020 Classes Pass/Fail An Option Due to COVID-19

Edit *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev)*

https://wtop.com/fairfax-county/2020/10/hundreds-of-gmu-students-petition-for-pass-fail-grading-system/

I posted about it in another thread but folks do need to think about a few things before making a choice to support or not support pass/fail. 1. Pass/Fail is literally impossible for some classes. They simply cant because it requires a certain grade to proceed on the educational path. So even with pass/fail you may not have it as an option. 2. Pass/Fail can SCREW YOU OVER down the line when it comes to continuing education or certain degree requirements. You may have to RE-TAKE courses to get letter grades, meaning you are spending more money, and more time, then perhaps you expected all because you took a pass/fail option. 3. Pass/Fail doesnt look good on a transcript and while it's likely not to make a giant difference, it will factor in to anything that would involve a review of your college transcript. I think it's unlikely they will do Pass/Fail since we knew coming into fall things would be online, even with the added stress of COVID and a crazy 2020. But I COMPLETELY understand why some feel as if they want it. Its a no win situation for some students and that sucks.

going to make this post about the petition to be the one that's pinned and i'll be removing any reposts regarding it as per the rules

Im failing regardless

Inb4 hate but UMD did do pass/fail last semester and plan not to do it again fall. Due to inconsistencies from GMU, pass/fail might be a hopeful possibility

I don’t think I will need this but I signed it for those that will. Good luck this semester

Hoping they do this for spring semester as well. It's a difficult time for students right now.

Is there any update about this?

u/textro can we pin this?

Would this just be for undergrads or graduate students at GMU? It’s my first semester and I have literally not gotten a single grade back yet.

Not guna happen

Why? Online classes are easy AF.

I sent them the tip yesterday lol I'm glad they wrote an article so fast!

bro I'm not a mod.. you need to ask them via mod mail or something

Not guna happen

not all online classes are built and structured equally and not all professors are able to handle teaching online in this format

In addition to what ToePlusKnee pointed out, take the age-old platitude: *What's easy for some, is not easy for others*

You would still have the option to keep a letter grade. Happy to hear you’re doing well but most of your fellow classmates aren’t because of the pandemic.

So then don't choose P/F you dip

Edit *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev)*

Great job! Thank you

Your advisor is wrong then. We went through this same thing in spring. Certain classes require a certain grade or percentage threshold to move onto the next class. How would that possibly function in a pass/fail system? This is a good readup: https://www.uopeople.edu/blog/do-pass-fail-classes-affect-your-gpa/ But also keep in mind they only offer Pass/Fail to undergraduates for a reason. And they have a disclaimer for a reason as well: >What about major courses and professional programs that require a certain grade? >Students are encouraged to consult with their academic advisors or program coordinators before making a decision about converting course grades to the pass/fail grading system. Academic advisors should discuss with students any accreditation standards or other programmatic requirements related to students’ academic performance in courses in the major. However, the decision to select the pass/fail grading option and any responsibility associated with that decision reside with the student I am not saying everyone will be affected, but there clearly is the potential to have to retake a course (unless the school jumps the gun and doesnt offer that particular course as pass/fail to begin with).

Not gonna happen

This is silly. Suck it up and get it done. Don't let the Gen Xers see how coddled you are.

They emailed me this morning but I didn't read it on time. I'll try to contact the reporter again

Never gunna give you up

i'm not sure if you realize that every student also has their own different living situations, whether it be on or off campus. it can impact their mental health greatly and all you're doing is just putting things in a very disrespectful manner

Never gunna let you down

Never gunna let you cry

Just a month in w/ a 3 class schedule & already considering dropping 1

top it off with being stuck in a house with a toxic mother who picks fights while you try to get stuff done.

Knowing GMU could send me back home at any time really doesn’t help matters. I’m hoping the campus wide mandatory testing ends well so there can be some good news Also edit, I’m taking 4 classes. Meant I’m consideri going down to 3.

And stuck in the house gaining weight. Cuz even if you do get up and exercise at the gym or go running, you’re not doing the normal walking around you’d do during the school or work day so you ain’t burning extra calories :(

if i dropped a class that would put me down to 10 credits would i be charged for part time ?

Why? Is grad read really that bad? 🥺😢

don't, you'll regret it

Best of luck to you. I have my mother like that. One time i was taking an exam when she barged into my room thinking I was smoking weed... it was my incense Gets mad at me when I am doing homework or studying instead of playing with our dogs

I have a verbally abusive stepmom so I'm right there with you 😭

True and true. Glad someone else is in my boat in regards to dropping. I had 5 classes but one got cancelled. I took that as a sign & didn’t choose a new 5th. Since posting this I’ve changed my consideration to auditing so I can get some of the basic stuff. I love the content but she’s a tough (even if fair) grader & I’m just rly bad at this online shit. Ty for this bc responses from my friends who aren’t even considering dropping feel a bit hollow

Yep. I wasn’t super active last semester but even when I was at my most depressed I left the room. To get food or go to classes. But now... nah. Even before I got to the point I’m at rn I sometimes went a few days without leaving my dorm (apartment style)

Wondering the same thing

Hahaha, yeah, about that. I’m undergrad. I’m just not good at normal school & Covid school is hell

I literally am looking for online jobs so I can move out (somewhere cheap like RVA). Its my last full semester but its just unbearable

You’ve got 3 days homie. I already know imma prob be stuck for another semester so I had no concern w/ dropping down to 3. If you think you can make the credits work down the line, fuckin go to 1 bro. Get that 50% off before it’s too late & you’re stuck with a W, a lot of pain, or a tanked GPA. Don’t wanna sound like a doomer but ye

aw ok thank u

Preferably I would like to move to another state. I used to go to Richmond often and its a pretty cool place, much more fun than this area when it comes to social life. Kinda was turned away when I saw that tuition was higher than GMU.

To everyone still with exams left 💛✨

I really love cumulative exams. They are so fun and packed with wonderful, long drawn out semester packed information that makes it very easy to retain all the wonderful information.

Thanks I hope so!

I needed this

Professor just did me a solid. I missed my exam deadline (got my deadlines backwards for classes with similar name). He gave me a day to do it, and I got a 90%. Went from almost failing the class to a B+. 😊

Thank u Cat Wizard

Rolling out on campus like it's Mario Kart

I think there's gonna be an issue when they get in the way of students walking to class.

I guess we're no longer allowed to enter the JC

Okay these are cool, but how much of our tuition goes towards this? Wouldn't it be nice if it went towards more parking and better housing....

Does this mean we can have food ordered to where we're on the campus?

What are these?

If you see a Spotted Lanternfly on campus, it’s an invasive species and you should kill it. I’m seeing spotted lanternflies on campus a bit more often, I’ve already had to take out two in less than 24 hours between. They can do damage to crops and gardens and their waste can make mold grow.

Make sure to [familiarize yourself with their full life cycle](https://cals.cornell.edu/integrated-pest-management/outreach-education/whats-bugging-you/spotted-lanternfly/spotted-lanternfly-biology-and-lifecycle#identification)

I've seen dead ones on campus, no live ones yet

i stepped on one the other day and someone got mad at me for pointlessly killing a bug lmao

I biked the w&od to Purcellville last weekend and kept seeing these walking on the trail and were wondering what they were, next time I will run them over lol

They’re so pretty!

Do we know how these got here, or is it a conspiracy theory to destroy all our trees

You can find living ones of trees, I just saw a bunch of them living on a small tree.

I agree! It's a bummer that they're invasive, since otherwise I'd love to see them around.

On a boat shipment filled with stone from Asia. The stone had their eggs on them which eventually made land fall in Pennsylvania. Also there are zero conspiracy theories. They have been killing farmers crops and wineries grape vines here in virginia at wine makers. You can see some people on the NoVA subreddit complain about it because we have some local farmers here who grow fruits.

invasive species ain't a conspiracy theory, the plants in our area just didn't evolve long at all with them in our habitats so theres nothing preying on them and they get a free buffet on the trees Theres no predators actively eating them.

Did you kill them all?

Good news! The giant Joro spiders eat them! Also preying mantises.

Some of them I could not reach, I need to buy a fly swatter.

ooh awesome

Supposedly bats do as well so maybe encourage your friends and family to put a bat house up.

Unfortunately I think there’s only a small overlap in their schedules.

Apparently I Didn’t Graduate I am so upset and frustrated with George Mason because apparently I never graduated? Earlier in May I walked the stage and celebrated with my family as a first generation graduate. I had submitted for my graduation in the winter semester and was pre approved. I met with someone from my advising office and everything looked good! I got all the emails from tassel and the university congratulating me on graduating! Well two days ago I started the paperwork with my company to apply to grad school. I was looking for an email about why my degree was taking so long and I got one from the Registrars office instead claiming that “There is an issue with your graduation status due to four missing credits”. Why was this never communicated to be BEFORE I walked the stage? I of course called everyone and emailed my advisor asking for help and answers. And none of them understand why I never got an email explaining I wasn’t eligible. They even checked themselves and did not see an email from the Degree Compliance office telling me I was missing the credits. I was missing four elective credits and now I’m registering for a quick summer courses, but what the hell?? I’m not upset that I am technically not a graduate, in my eyes I am. I’ve worked hard throughout college and got to walk the stage and celebrate with my loved ones. I’m just so upset that GMU did this to me and failed me. Why was I approved? Why did they tell me I had all I needed when I didn’t? Why did they only notify me on an email a MONTH after I walked? They couldn’t have called, sent a letter, or emailed my personal one? I wasn’t checking my email anymore I thought I was free of this place 😭 Moral of the story: If you plan on coming to GMU get ready for four years of non communication on every level💚💛 Update: I do know I am at fault here guys, I’m sorta an idiot and didn’t realize I was short the four credits since it looked like everything was checked off on degree works. HOWEVER, others received the notifications that they were ineligible for graduation and that is where my frustration lies (because i never got one🙃). BUT on the bright side I’m registered for some fun easy summer classes and hey—if I get two more A’s I’m graduating cum laude 🤷🏻‍♀️! All is good and always positive! Thanks for all the advice and stuff :)

Both you and your advisor didn't notice you were short credits? Did everything look right in degree works/audit? If everything looked right I'd fight it.

Double check all your paperwork \*just\* to triple-check you didn't miss an email somewhere, then elevate this to the appropriate Dept. Chair and Dean. You're right--this should've gotten caught.

That is like a recurring stress dream for me I graduated in 2003 and to this day I have nightmares that I have to go back to school to make up credits for a failed English class. (I’m sorry this happened to you but be assured that you will get through it!)

You probably missed it. gmu will let you graduate “walk” when you are close to finishing the requirements. “Walking” doesn’t necessarily mean you completed the requirements. Didn’t you check your unofficial transcript? It tells you how many earned credits you have. That should have been the first thing you’ve looked at. But - I wont stress much about it. 4 credits is literally one class

OP, my biggest advice to you and any other GMU student is ALWAYS check DegreeWorks. That’s the only way you’ll ever find out if you’re missing any credits. I remember in my last semester when I was missing a 3 credit class that should’ve already been fulfilled and I contacted my advisor about it. I made my advisor check through the system and she told me DegreeWorks didn’t populate correctly. Even though I already took the class to fulfill that 3 credit requirement. This might’ve been because I switched majors and DegreeWorks probably didn’t understand that 2 different classes could fulfill the same credit requirement. My advisor knew this and took action only because I informed her about it ahead of time. If I hadn’t done all this then I probably might’ve ended up in the same situation as you. But honestly though, I’m really sorry you had to go through all that. No graduate should ever have to go what you did. At the end of the day it’s their fault and not yours.

When i started as a freshman they told me that a math class i took in high school does not qualify for a transfer credit. I looked on the website and it does. emailed a bunch of people with these screenshots and got it fixed. these departments want money from us. make sure you’ve checked all IB or AP or Dual enrollment etc classes and see if it’s something like that you can transfer. these departments do not communicate with each other unless you make them

It’s all on you. It’s your schedule, and you should’ve noticed how many classes you had left. You can still walk at graduation even if you have a class or two remaining.

My daughter had emergency brain surgery in October 2023 - and had a stroke during surgery. I’ve never seen so many unhelpful people as I did at GMU after this. You can’t talk to disability without an appointment, but an appointment takes weeks to get and by that time finals were approaching. Still to this day, I’ve never heard back from her advisor. If she medically withdrew, which would require the neurosurgeon to write a letter - not to mention her incision was massive so not something she could be faking - they would have kept 100% of the tuition money.

Did you reconcile your classes with the plan of study courses in degree works? Did you transfer in any credits that didn’t get applied? Double check so you don’t waste time/money. I believe you can walk if you are short a few credits but someone should have told you this.

They effed up omg but ok take the 4 credits online or something and put it behind u. That’s horrible but u seem to have one option

I can’t believe they did this to you! It’s frustrating, I hope you get some sort of reimbursement!

Just my .02 but I just finished a 1.5ish month long email debate with the CS/CEC departments about my graduation requirements. It seems some things aren't 100% synced since they're transitioning from DegreeWorks to Degree Audit. A number of my classes weren't actually being properly counted towards my CS degree. TL;DR - double, triple, and then quadruple check that your classes are being counted properly in Degree Audit and raise a complaint with the appropriate higher powers.

Classic GMU: we fucked up but you gotta be the one to face the consequences, fuck you and have a nice day. Seriously tho if I was you I’ll try to sue these bureaucratic private institution fuckers

Similar situation happened to me. I took geography instead of geology for a science credit but it didn't count towards my major. It discovered a few weeks before graduation but I was allowed to walk and had to take a summer course for geology.

Not from gmu but dont you guys do graduation checklist/audits? I have ba and masters and every time i graduated had to sit with advisor or submit a form to go over the requirements and that its satisfied

What did you get your degree in? Wondering if I will have the same issue

Somehow I have had bad dreams about going through semester, skipping class and not turning in assignments and being serious as well as not paying attention to what outcome my grade will be and whether I will get passing grade

I can assure you it isn’t just GMU. It happened to me too in TN. Someone caught my advisor’s miscalculation days before graduation. My degree required a 6 months long internship and they wanted me to go back and take one general class. I said nope. Luckily, I had attended another university and they made an exception.

I’m glad you’re choosing to have a positive attitude about it! A side note though, I remember that in college and grad school that the number of accumulated credit hours are listed at the bottom of your grade slip/transcript along with your GPA each semester. Is GMU different? I’m a UMCP grad. Congratulations!

Hey at least it worked out plus you can graduate cum Laude

Oh boy this is giving me flashbacks. Not quite the same but a class I took sophomore year at Mason for some credit…by the time I was beginning second semester of my last year — that class I’d completed no longer counted toward whatever credit it was. Had to rush to add some nonsense class I hadn’t mapped out time for while trying to wrap my second minor. Didn’t have the energy to track down the advisor that I’d never been able to get a meeting with before, so just did it. But oh I was mad.

This happened to me and it just now got resolved last week, they admitted it was an administrative error. I’m sorry you’re going through this, it’s so stressful. You’d think with the money you spend they’d be able to keep better track.

Why did GMU do this to me?!?! Don’t you have access to Degreeworks?

I graduated in 1999 and a friend of mine who was graduating with me had this happen to him. It's a Mason tradition, apparently.

Welcome to GMU. Every semester of mine something went wrong. This is horrific.

I definitely didn’t notice and I guess whoever let me walk didn’t notice either, but looking at my transcript I can see I’m missing 4. But idk what went through my head yk, like when I had the meeting with advising assistant they said it looked fine so I guess I just assumed I was good🤷🏻‍♀️

No for sure, once I get everything settled I’m going to be contacting everyone😭 At least give me the classes for free or something yk??

I have dreams that I was enrolled in a course that I forgot about and wasn't attending all semester.

Same for me though I graduated in 2022. Keep waking up in cold sweats thinking, I didn’t complete my English assignments and failed my English class.

No literally I had recurring nightmares just like this after graduating, it's crazy what college does to you.

literally me but about high school lol I graduated Mason last month so hopefully that dream stops…or probably comes back but it’s college 😭

Like I said, I definitely didn’t realize when looking at the transcripts and that’s on me. But the advising assistant didn’t notice either and said I was good to go🤷🏻‍♀️ Just kinda took his word for it since it’s his job. But yea I’m not saying it’s entirely GMUs fault, i’m dumb asf too, but the fact they never sent that communication (pre graduation) that I was not eligible for graduation spring 2025 is what irks me 🙂‍↕️

At the end of the day it's our own responsibility as students to make sure we meet the degree requirements. It's not great to have an advisor misguide students but that happens constantly. We need to make sure we have our own stuff figured out and trust no one. Double check your degree plan each semester, discuss it with your advisor and with other students.

It’s a public institution

reading comprehension is not a hot commodity these days it seems. it says in the post.

Yeah, I wouldn't trust advisors on these things. I've heard similar stories over and over again. So yeah, always check these things over and over. Make sure you understand everything yourself.

I’ve had friends walk that needed just a few credits that they got in summer school. That’s a big reason why they don’t give you a diploma right away.

They still let summer grads walk in may. So ain’t their fault

if you think of it, I would be very interested in an update. I really hope this all works out for you!

Oh yeah. I agree. We as students have a responsibility as well since this is our degree that we’re paying for. At the same time, its also true for advisors to do everything they can to ensure students succeed since that’s their job that they’re literally getting paid for. Students shouldn’t have to do the work that advisors literally get paid to do.

Cheating culture I hate it. I hate when people casually mention they do cheat. The worst part is they don’t cheat to only pass. They cheat to get the top of the class and wreck the curve. I don’t cheat cause I’m personally horrified of violating academic integrity + fear graduating as a total idiot. I should not be punished for that. Tempted to snitch so bad rn but I have no proof besides them telling me. Edit: cheating to be top of curved graded class means it will be harder for everyone else to get a good grade because that’s how curved classes work. Seriously look it up before telling me to just work harder.

i’ve never met anyone who cheated for any other reason than to pass. i even edited an article on how cheating is more common in stem majors because the rigorous courseload and high demands drive them to cheat to try and keep from failing

The only solution is to just focus on your own studies and score higher. There’s always going to be a cheater but they aren’t directly hindering you from achieving the same grade legitimately. If it’s homework, pre-lab, online quiz expect to get a 100%. For my exams if I want an A I gotta study my ass off so I know everything. I’ve seen people sit next to each other so they can share answers literally my anatomy lecture exam last week. I peeped at their score and they got a whole letter grade below me. Even with three minds who relied on each other to know the material didn’t succeed. I’m just sayin you shouldn’t judge people (circumstances like baby, family issues, rough week) and snitch on them because you could be in a similar situation in the future.

worry about yourself.

I know of someone who was set to graduate in May, got written up for cheating and got kicked out of the university in April. No degree.

If you cheat, you have already failed.

One of my professors from Genetics class was aware of cheating, so for his tests, we had to write essays to one of the prompt he gave us. None of his questions were multiple choice or fill in the blank etc..., We always had to explain ourselves. He said if we can put it in writing using our own words, that was proof we understood the concepts. I agree with him, even though it was a pain in the ass to write, it made me realize what is my level of understanding. My point is, professors should also take steps to hinder cheating.

I got an award for having the highest GPA in my degree (not bragging). The year before, I was in a group with the girl who ended up getting the award for that year. She was constantly talking about how she plagiarized, cheated, and turned in the same essays for different classes. So, yeah cheating does bother me too when you’ve done it the right way.

Tbh, some classes are only possible to pass with cheating. In my accounting class, the first exam had a question about which US president was on the homepage of the class. Completely ridiculous

I saw so many people using ai to cheat in my philosophy class last semester. It was really depressing to actually see smh

What are you gonna get out of it by snitching lol let them cheat they are f up their own future

Let the cheaters ruin their own future. They’ll be coasting rn, but will struggle in the future. But still most cheaters still perform worse than someone who puts in the work.

I'm here to learn, not just get a grade. It's part of why I love CDS being less strict than CS, I can explore and learn and get more out of it and talk with professors who are leaders in their fields instead of panicking over my grade on an assignment. Wanting to learn more than just the lectures also means I explore beyond the basic class material in a way that often leads to top grades as a side effect. Most of life isn't gonna give you a rubric or a checklist or a numeric score. I had a company that I'd helped save millions of dollars a quarter by process improvement outside the scope of my basic data entry title give me an average score for performance because my raw numbers weren't as high... Because I set an entire team up for success. If it wasn't for office politics, I'd have been upper management soon enough.

you have bigger problems when you get out of college. if your biggest problem right now is what other people are doing with their lives then you clearly are the problem. you are not an administrator and have nothing to gain by interfering with these people. leave people alone and get a hobby! if you are horrified to cheat then thats your problem stop hating on others because you cant control yourself.

The culture of cheating won't change unless cheaters are held accountable. Definitely snitch. Cheaters should leave school if they can't handle the coursework without cheating.

I'm curious how many professors, TAs, and GTAs or on this subreddit. It has to be like 25%😂

Dude worry about your self, this is a bad for your own mental health. These types of people are everywhere in the world, your not gonna battle all of them

Fortunately, cheating is taken very seriously as well. I've lost count of how many people failed classes or got suspended for using AI. There is a rumor on Reddit that professors cannot tell AI apart from human writing and that there is no way of proving it. That could not be further from the truth. There are few posts about failing classes, getting suspended or expelled despite how many times I've seen this happen. The risks are too high and denying worsens the consequences. Universities are catching on and are taking things very seriously. Why should the students who cheat cause group work grades to fail or suffer? And why should students who cheat be eligible for the honors, scholarships and support that honest students actually deserve? Report that mess. I saw someone who only used AI be awarded before she was busted and failed a class when a hardworking student could have received that award. Sure, it was very embarrassing for her when she was caught and she will not know how to answer basic interview questions after relying so heavily on AI so she will not get a decent job after graduating. But it went on for too long before it caught up with her. We should all report the students who cheat to pave the way for awards and scholarships going to the people who actually deserve it.

What they don’t understand is cheating may get them the degree and the degree will get them an interview… but everyone interviewing them will be able to see that they do not know what they’re talking about.

You will win the long run. They will lose. Don’t snitch.

Tryna snitch on someone is crazy

So glad I only had one class that had a grading curve. Such a stupid ass system.

If someone snitched on me during my time at Mason. Ohhh boy stuff would happen.

Best thing to do is worry about yourself and not others.

Worry about yourself lol imagine having the time to constantly worry about how others are getting through the class they’re paying for. It’s not our fault gmu has horrible professors.. get a hobby 😭

Karma will get them, dw😅. Don’t worry about them. Just do your own thing, and you’re good to go.

That's pretty interesting actually

op is worried about themself. in fact, the course grading usually curve base on the overall class performance. but when most of people cheated, the curve might not seems required (when 90% people got A, teacher just won't bother). which eventually leads to outcomes, like, takes the grades he/she has and without the chance to bump a little.

No wonder why you're looking for valorant accounts for sale.

Dam, all that to not graduate in a month🤦‍♂️

That shit would set me off. I was working my ass off on a paper and this girl used AI to do her’s and then used AI to review mine. I ended up letting the professor know and stressed that my problem wasn’t even her using AI on her own work, it was her taking mine without permission and feeding it to an AI algorithm.

What a useless class 😂

Do you not know how grading curves work? Cheaters inflate the class average, which inflates the curve values given out by the prof, so someone not cheating can receive a lower curved score with even one cheater. The secondary effect of this can be the professor not really knowing how their class is doing; if a section on paper is doing well because of cheaters, they won't know whether to properly adjust their lectures, give out additional resources, include grade makeup opportunities such as grade revisions/more graded coursework, etc.; from just this it can branch out: teachers receive worse RMP reviews, cheaters themselves drag down the institution's credibility when they f up in the future, people drop classes or switch majors because they can't do as well due to semester-long crappy curves/improper teacher adjustment.

f up their own future 😭 bro half of things learned in college won’t be applied into ur actual job

Satisfaction.

You’re being downvoted, but you are correct

the school system needs to change. stop giving us bs ass classes.

they’re not gonna ask you “how were you doing in that calculus class”

The only person they’re cheating are themselves in the long run

That's called retaliation and you would get consequences from office of student conduct far worse than those from office of academic integrity! Hope this helps!

we really do hv some pretty bad professors

to each to their own.

neckbeard so mad he going thru ppls comment history lmao

lol fan behavior you need to worry about yourself you have 10k reddit karma 😂

What was Professors response? When the consequence of using AI to do your assignments is simply a new assignment or reduced points, or no consequence whatsoever, then it should be no surprise how prevalent it becomes. These students are devaluing the degree not only for themselves, but to everyone else with that same degree. When employers realize degrees are no longer representative of some basic ability to think critically, what is the outcome going to be? Sure, cheating has always existed. But not to the level of absolute dominance it has reached today.

I’ve never seen a cheater ruin a curve. It’s always a diligent student who studies well. I know it’s a problem that’s increasing, but snitching will not solve this at all. You snitch on one student, you suddenly have 5 people who hate your guts and all the millions of cheaters are chilling.

I don’t know of many classes that do curves. Most have a ‘lowest exam score gets dropped’ type thing. Even then cheaters still don’t usually get the highest score.

Sure you might not use the knowledge itself, but you certainly will use your ability to follow a basic set of instructions, assess and interpret problems/tasks, use some level of critical thinking, all of which are skills people who rely on AI are not exercising. There is an entire generation whose only academic skill set consists soley of copy pasting assignment instructions into a textbox. Idk about you, but that doesn't seem like a skill worth paying someone thousands of dollars a month for. They might be able to get away with it in school, but having zero self integrity is going to catch up with them quick in the real world. Employers will see straight through the bullshit.

Ok, but what does that have to do with cheating?

🤣😂🤣 only if you’re a math teacher. Hiring managers are going to ask about our majors though. Or any other education that relates directly to the job being applied for. And as a hiring manager, I could tell who knew their career field and who didn’t.

Mason requires all students to be vaccinated by August 1st. Students who will be attending in person classes in fall are required to get fully vaccinated.

Is there any reason why some of us didn't get this email? I feel like I always get like half of the covid-related emails from mason and idk why

Here’s the email for those who haven’t gotten it yet. Dear Patriots, We have just completed one of the most challenging times in the history of George Mason University, and I am grateful for the important role that everyone played in making this year a tremendous success. This week, I am pleased to share that we are reporting just one active case of COVID-19 on our campuses. Think about that for a moment. That’s an amazing accomplishment for our community and it is a testament to the number of people who have been vaccinated. As we turn our attention to the Fall Semester, we must all continue to do our part and work together to keep Mason safe. This starts with new policies for COVID-19 vaccination, testing and masking. Below is a summary of what we will require, so please read this carefully. COVID-19 Vaccination Students: Mason will require that all students be vaccinated against COVID-19 by August 1. This policy does not apply to students who take online courses only and do not come to any campus, or to individuals who have an approved medical or religious exemption. Plan ahead: Depending on the type of vaccine you receive, you may have to receive your first dose no later than July 4 to meet the August 1 requirement. Upload COVID vaccination documentation to the Health Services Patient Portal. Visit the Student Health Services website for FAQs, information on how to upload your COVID vaccine documentation (all students), or submit your Mason Immunization Record Form (newly admitted students). If you are an international student with limited access to COVID vaccines, please email immunize@gmu.edu to request an extension. Students with approved extensions must get vaccinated when they arrive in the United States. Faculty and Staff: All faculty and staff are expected to be fully vaccinated in time for the Fall Semester, and are strongly encouraged to receive vaccines over the summer. All employees are required to disclose whether or not they have been vaccinated in Mason Covid Health Check by June 11, 2021. Those who have been fully vaccinated will be required to upload vaccination documentation into the Health Services Patient Portal before August 1. We anticipate full FDA approval of at least one COVID vaccine over the summer. At that time, we anticipate requiring that all employees receive the vaccine. An exemption process will be made available. We encourage everyone to learn about the vaccine and get immunized. Mason will continue to host vaccination clinics on campus at no cost through the fall semester. To set up an appointment, go to vaccine.gmu.edu. Masking Mason will lift mask requirements for all fully vaccinated individuals on campus as of May 29 – except in medical facilities, public transit, child care facilities and in accordance with the Governor’s policy. Unvaccinated individuals should continue to wear masks on campus, per the Governor’s new executive order. Masks may be removed while eating, drinking, playing instruments and for other exemptions allowed. Mason will encourage everyone to wear masks in classes and indoors this summer, to allow more time for people to get vaccinated, and will support anyone who wants to continue wearing a mask after that. See Mason’s updated mask policy. Testing Unvaccinated individuals will be required to participate in COVID testing at least once a week and as frequently as three times a week, depending on conditions. Vaccinated faculty, staff and students may be required to participate in less frequent testing, based on the guidance from public health officials and testing capacity. Symptomatic individuals, whether vaccinated or unvaccinated, should still self-isolate and seek evaluation and diagnostic testing. Additional Safety Policies Physical Distancing: Mason will require physical distancing of three feet during the summer; in the fall, we anticipate being able to remove physical distancing requirements once vaccination rates exceed 80 percent. Mason COVID Health Check: Mason will continue to require everyone’s participation in the daily health check this summer; we will reassess the need for continuing in the fall, based on the vaccination data received. We have made tremendous strides during this extraordinary time. I continue to be amazed by the resilience of the Mason Nation. Let’s keep working together to keep Mason safe. Sincerely, Gregory Washington President

What is the policy for students who are against taking the vaccine for one reason or another? To be clear, I am not among this population, I got my second dose almost two weeks ago.

If you lost your card, you can request an immunization vaccine record from the Virginian VDH

Link to the requirements and how to submit: https://shs.gmu.edu/immunizations/covidvaccinerequirement/

Additionally, no masks are required for vaccinated individuals as of Friday

Good thing I got my second dose last week.

If were vaxxed by Mason, do we still need to upload out vaccination cards?

I haven't received an email yet, but the "Your Daily COVID Health Check Reminder" included a notification about.

Edit *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev)*

Never got this email but.... Already 2 steps ahead. Got my second Pfizer vaccine May 12th. Walking around without my mask and loving every minute of it! (except indoor places that have a lot people in them of course)

I'll probably get down voted (and no I'm not an anti-vaxxer or anti-masker). I'm already vaccinated, but students in general should be able to have a choice & not be pressured into it, period.

How will they enforce this? Many have vaccinated but don't have proof to show for it.

There's religious and medical exemption allowed. The email even stated that unvaccinated will have to be in mask. So that's not true that its mandatory for everyone.

Can we get vaccinated when we reach GMU? I’m from India and the government is currently giving vaccines for people aged 18 and above . I’m 17 years old . I can get it done separately but I do not get any documentation . So I’m thinking to get vaccinated when I reach GMU this fall. Is that possible ?

Is the school still doing free vaccines for students?

Will the students with approved medical or religious exemptions be allowed to dorm and attend in person classes?

What counts as a religious exemption?

I’m religiously exempt

Is this 1984?

Yeah I didn’t get it either.

Same, it's confusing because I'm scheduled to go on campus in the fall and didnt see anything except here and the website. lol

Are you registered for classes for fall?

Look at your inbox carefully. I got it. Are you sure you're active student?

Thank you for the info! I didn’t receive this email at all even though I have a few in person classes and labs.

Thanks for posting..... for some reason I didn't receive it even though I have classes on campus in the fall

You're the MVP! Like many others I didn't receive it as well. Is there a link to the Health Portal service? Or is it on Patriot Web?

Yes you have to upload the vaccination card in patient portal

You can go ahead and upload them now if you want. I did mine a few hours ago. Just scanned the vaccination card and uploaded it as a PDF to the patient portal!

>This policy does not apply to students who take online courses only and do not come to any campus, or to individuals who have an approved medical or religious exemption. No vaccine + no medical or religious exemption = No going on campus

Yeah the president sent out an email few minutes ago

I pasted it in my other comment

Yes, they did

Not required. No one is going to force you to not wear a mask, they simply gave the option.

Not a good idea at all on behalf of Mason. Masks should be heavily encouraged until the beginning of 2022 at least. I can already see people will start abusing this policy by thinking being vaccinated = no responsibility to wear a mask & we'll start to see more cases again smh.

All my classes are virtual this fall and I got the email. Make sure you're in the "all enrolled students" Mason Listerv

Schools all over - GMU included - have already required vaccinations for years for things like TB and MMR. I suppose you could make the argument that this vaccine is different somehow but you'd be fighting an uphill battle.

My body not my choice !

You can choose to get vaccinated like a reasonable person or you can choose to stay home.

How many vaccines are already required by GMU (and other schools of various education levels)? Would you say the same about tetanus or HPV?

You do have a choice. You just gotta wear a mask :)

Yes! Those who down vote you are simply unaware of what a slippery slope this is. You are correct, freedom of choice is at stake here. Without that, all is lost.

You should have your vaccination card. That's how they are enforcing it. Students need to have submitted that as documentation. If not some other documentation is going to be needed. If you don't have your vaccination card/ it wasn't filled out after the second shot I would reach out to them about it.

I suspect people will be "kicked out" of classes or not be able to register for classes.

During a global pandemic where millions are unemployed, unable to pay bills, and struggling to get by, GMU decides to... increase tuition.

That was not very cash money of them

Someone correct me if I’m wrong, so James Madison announced they didn’t increase tuition, but increased other fees https://www.jmu.edu/news/2020/05/15-tuition-freeze.shtml correct? The way I’m looking at, at least GMU seems to be straightforward about just telling us there’s an increase in tuition, where JMU said there’s no tuition increase, but went ahead and increased fees anyways?

Unpopular opinion: this is the ceiling, not the floor, is actually a reassuring statement, though the premise of more state funding rather than a cost and budget review is kind of meh. On the other side, the maintenance of existing structures doesn't go away. The cost of them existing remains, and there are costs that a lot of people don't understand. For example shutting down a floor in the hotel I work at doesn't save as much as you think. We can't shut our heat or ac for long because lack of air circulation plus humidity promotes mold growth, which is far more expensive to treat than shutting everything off. We did cut our electric bill from 32k a month to 16k, but are only going to clear 70k this month instead of 700k. Paying for and implementing new online systems costs money, even if they are reducing salaries, saving on food service, there isn't a huge financial benefit to shutting down a campus.

Modest 450 my ass 🤣🤣🤣

Unbelievable, I can't even begin to understand how any of this makes sense. Raising tuition when money is already tight.... yeah..

Wow that’s gonna be a great first semester

Not even surprised

Might take semester a off tbh after this

This is goddamn ridiculous! I transferred from Nova and started in spring semester at Mason. Had to paid like nearly $4,000 for 2 classes and immunization shots since Im in my mid 20s and doctors no longer kept my records after a certain age. Nova I could have taken like 5-6 classes with that amount. Had to literally take a $5,000 loan to get by the semester just for two classes..., then all this crap happens and it ended up feeling like the longest semester of my life. They should at least refunded the mandatory student fees since we never had access to those useless features. I go from working a good decent paying job to delivering pizzas since there isn’t much jobs right now other than retail/delivery and over 36 million people are unemployed. I get laid off and my old job is going out of business because of this virus. I should have just stick with my associate degree and called it quits. I done with GMU. Until this pandemic finally ends, theres no way Im going continue with this nonsense. The prices and student loan debt will go up and what then? Its going to be difficult getting job either way with a college degree. It was already hard getting a job with a degree before the pandemic.

yeah, unf*king believable. I thought i was reading it wrong.

Pretty sure the song goes “Hail to George Mason, give your green and gold!”

I’m livid. Fuck these corrupt people. This is highway robbery at this point.

I mean, I get it, but I also really, really want my first semester of college to be actually in college

Like saying its "Modest" makes a difference.

We should sue.

What ever happened to our tuition freeze?

I hope that its just a $450 flat fee and not a per credit fee or I will not be able to pay for school anymore considering that my courses are already around $1,500 per Credit without the additional Fees.

It’s like they’re forcing us to take a gap year lmao

i’m not surprised. it just irritated me that they called it a small, modest tuition increase. yeah, right 🙄

GMU: "modest $450 tuition increase" Also GMU: "most equitable and fiscally responsible solution"

You’re pissed cause of a $450 increase? That’s like nothing in the grand scheme of things. The college still has to operate during a pandemic and they’re completely renovating the old as fuck parts of campus. Like are you surprised? This is some reactionary shit.

Not very cash money at all.

Not at all!

Totally debt money

ah yes a ceiling, they also increase tuition cost like \~500 for every credit over 15 not so long ago! ha btw my major requires more than 120 to graduate so if I want to grad in 4 years? Ill have to take more than 15 every semester whoops thanks gmu

Modest is kinda insulting in my opinion. To a lot of people right now $450 is a lot. That can go towards rent, groceries, medical, etc etc.

It makes perfect sense. It's a raise so it's a win for gmu and its low enough that no one will transfer over it. Does it make sense from a student-centered approach though? Nah.

The commonwealth will undoubtedly cut funding significantly. They’re trying to hedge that loss a little bit.

Fewer students--->more programs they can cut

Go to community college I transferred from nova and I saved over $30,000. Also the professors are way easier in nova. Best decision in my life

Go to community college if you aren’t already a transfer student.

Tuition is only going to continue going up. Six year plan=Six years of increase. At least the possibility exist for tuition to to back down this year.

They have a 1.18 billion dollar budget which doesn’t include the thousands of dollars they take from each of their 35k students 😐

you should totally stop! that'll show 'em!

Please tell me you aren’t serious.

Dad's credit card go brrrr money

Was just saying, the post earlier on JMU people were praising them for not raising tuition but in reality they just added more fees elsewhere, and then people are angry GMU raises it. Idk I just thought it was interesting, not trying to call them out for doing that

Lol doesn’t matter how they spin it. It is the same outcome.

I don't disagree that they worded it a bit better, I just thought it seemed a bit funny that I saw the other thread people were praising them for not increasing tuition... but they just increased other fees

That's pretty lame. Not trying to be like yay GMU, just saying shits fucked and most schools have numerous revenue sources that just dried up, while holding standard costs, and having to add new ones. Totally don't mean to say shit wasn't fucked up before and schools don't bring in or waste a ton of money.

More than 1/3 of the stimulus check.

Does that mean 450 per credit? If so that’s around a $72 increase which is more than an extra $800 for 12-15 credits. That’s a lot of money, so I don’t think it’s low, but I still won’t be transferring anytime soon lol.

Fortunately I am a transfer student but unfortunately it’s this year

Tuition will go up to the point where GMU starts losing money over it because students go elsewhere. That won't happen in the next decade though, just like GW and Georgetown.

Yeah, they’re renovating the whole campus in case you didn’t notice. Campus was built in the 50s, it needs renovating. Not to mention you still need to pay the salaries of workers and fund research. Yale’s budget is $3.8 billion and Penn State budget is $6.8 billion. If anything Mason has less of a budget. So stop spreading this reactionary bullshit. Edit: way to edit your comment after you posted it bitch.

Who else feels like class is a waste of time right now? Everything just feels so fucking pointless. I don't understand still having class meetings when I'm just trying to get more important things straightened out like having enough meds to last. And moving across states. And having enough to live. And avoiding getting sick. Like everyone else, school has been the last thing on my mind. I'm just happy to have a fucking job still. My partner lost his and luckily got unemployment, otherwise I don't know how we'd be able to afford rent. Mason should just give a universal pass or should've just ended the semester before the online thing. I'm graduating this semester and I'm under enough stress. I can't take this shit anymore. I was in the fucking hospital last month and missed enough as it is. I just want to graduate and pretend like this semester didn't happen. I am sure many other people are in the same shape and I hope all of you guys are doing ok in this shitshow of a semester. EDIT: Here's the petition you guys, let's get this thing going! http://chng.it/CPbPQ92Z

I always do work on campus so I can rest when I'm at home, but now that I'm here 24/7 I have almost no motivation to work. I wish I could get out and work somewhere else but that's not gonna happen. We just gotta keep moving forward.

Yeah I thought I was an introvert, but this stuff is really starting to get to me. Things haven't been going great since my store closed in like October and I got laid off. And I haven't been able to find work since then. Things have been steadily on the decline since then, I keep trying to keep my hopes up and look around the corner but like damn. I was trying to do my math hw last night and pearson went down and I nearly punched a hole in the wall. I don't think I've ever been so mentally drained before.

Seriously. I’m really considering taking the Fail on my sign language course because taking it online is absolutely insane. It’s just not nearly the same experience taking it in person was. And you’re right. Lockdown is getting extended until June... how the fuck am I going to pay rent if I can’t work? What a weird and awful time.

Yeah I agree. I can’t learn online and classes I was struggling with in person are practically impossible now. Out of school, I’m lucky enough to live by a lot of hiking trails and parks to stay active but sadly I lost my job yesterday and am probably gonna have to work at a grocery store again

Looking at other people’s discussion board seems to be the move for other people. My friend had 50+ pages of reading per class but since discussion boards seem to be the new attendence, he just reads over everyone else’s and makes his own using the others. Crazy how online makes people lazy.

Sorry to hear that man. Classes are still in my priorities but yeah, I got other shit to deal with right now (job and taking care of my parents). I have no clue what shape we’re all gonna be in financially and health wise after all of this but I’m taking it by each day.

I feel this. My wife is pregnant and I work full time - things were already rough before the Coronavirus came through. The amount of disruption this semester really merits higher leniency from the administration.

Me. I just don’t see it being worth trying to attend an online session when I know I won’t listen to anything they say. IT 102 is somewhat difficult in person but even harder online. It’s hard trying to teach yourself useless concepts that majority of which will never touch your future workspace.

Start another petition on change and pass it around. Pass/Fail when viral. The situation has gotten worse since then. I think universal pass is a good idea in this situation. STEM classes are difficult enough, completely switching online does not work for some courses. Labs used to be no big deal because it was a team effort, and we could ask the TA for one on one help. Now its a disaster because we can barely communicate our questions to the TA. It sucks that a situation not in our control is negatively effecting our grades, and mental state.

I was already kinda feeling down from this shit and this year decided to make it worse by having my cat die a couple days ago. I've been extremely unmotivated and depressed that any coursework feels like a massive boulder on my shoulders, especially english. I'm worried about my mom and the rest of my family back at home and other relatives I have in other states. I can't focus on anything right now. I've even lost motivation for some of my favorite video games like FFXIV. I can only handle things like animal crossing since I only need like 1 brain cell for that. Just give me a universal pass, I'm exhausted.

Honestly. This online classes is damaging on classes itself. Im in a class where we have to create a policy... A freaking government policy... for Fairfax County. And its due in less than a month. And we have NOTHING because we can’t contact the agency (bc they have their own crap to deal with) and we are here just sitting like “so... how do we get a contact of legal aid in GMU?” And my professor is so oblivious and trying to be optimistic but this woman needs to stop and cancel it because when the due date comes, our class is just gonna look like a bunch of grade-A asshats and it’ll look so horrible for us. Please GMU, I beg you to just pass us automatically this semester.

I have 0 motivation to do anything school related. I got an email about an assignment due tomorrow night and I realized I had completely forgotten about it

In my situation is that I was already stressed out cause of the virus. I just got laid off and this is the first time ever I had to apply for unemployment. My family is in the riskier age group and I am afraid of bringing it home and get them sick. Taking a test and doing homework is the last thing in my mind. This pandemic will not be over for a while. Hope everyone is safe and healthy and if you lost a loved one my heart goes out to you and know that you are not alone.

This is my first semester in mason. I’d transfer from Nova. Had to spend nearly $4,000 for 2 damn classes! Had to borrow $5,000 school loans, which is crazy for just 2 classes. I personally think i should have just stick with my associates degree and call it quits. Right now I am like everyone else. I got laid off because of the virus and I have no money to pay rent or other bills. Im starting to work with amazon delivery this week despite the risks. Seriously Mason should give everyone refund for the parking pass and those BS mandatory student fees. I feel like school is pointless now. Even if we recovery from this virus. Economy will take forever to recover and school might be more expensive and intolerable to put up with. Plus jobs are going to be a lot harder to get even with a degree.

I'm freaking injured and with out physical therapy or prp injections idk if my shoulder will now ever get better. It drives me insane that I can't do much exercise that was my lifestyle and now I'm stuck at home. I really wish we could just start over the year

Not the same position for me. I live at home, so rent ain't a thing. My job isn't one that would be eliminated or reduced. But I am a graduating senior, and have to worry about keeping my mom healthy (autoimmune condition). I already have a job in my field, and now my family is home 24/7, which is...suboptimal. I have no motivation for classes because none of this matters anymore, this semester didn't matter to start with, now it matters even less. All I want to do is dive into my job because my tasking is fun/cool. Dunno how to describe how unmotivated I am. I haven't been for the last 4 years, and it's even worse now.

[RANT] i just took my biochem quiz thing and holy shit do i see red lmfao short answer questions are time consuming and i still couldnt answer them cause theres no fucking time. im not a fucking biochemist. i dont fucking know and fuck you polayes youre a trash person for mocking students and a trash teacher you fucking senile bitch [END RANT] im okay with online learning, however it doesnt help when your teacher is a dumpster fire and doesnt know how to explain anything and expects you to know insanely detailed things ok im done ranting but like i agree there should be a universal pass and if you get above a C thats ya grade. can we do a mass email to have that? like im sure other graduating seniors this semester just want to graduate already and move on.

Who can we contact to inform them of what the student body is going through right now?

I sympathize. And I get why some folks are struggling. I hate online learning myself and it's been tough, but I also have been dealing with bigger things, like cancer, for a while now and in the grand scheme of things, dealing with the headache of what this semester has turned into is not that big a deal. But honestly? >Mason should just give a universal pass or should've just ended the semester before the online thing. How would that possibly work at all? You cant have folks being given a pass in a class they would not have passed because then it just screws both them and their next teacher/classmates in the subject that's next up. If they tried to give a pass/fail based upon what the midterm grade is, then you screw over folks who could have turned things around, or assume that the course has provided enough information to where a student could do the next course in line competently. ____________ Now, that said, I do think Mason should have been more flexible on allowing students to take a full refund and drop their classes without any penalties. And certainly, professors should be ready to do some curving based upon how students did pre-midterm and post-midterm. But you can't just "universal pass". That's a pipe dream and crazy talk.

Honestly everywhere the feeling is mutual. With all the craziness happening rn outside of school, it’s hard to keep up with school.

Oof, I feel you on the medication thing. I had just started a new job and missed the window for health insurance benefits by like a week so now I'm both not getting paid AND not insured. I'm trapped in our small house with my parents, brothers, dogs, cats, and am expected to cook most meals because all they want to eat is red meat and fried potatoes and I'm trying to keep everyone from dying of heart failure before covid even reaches us. I'm supposed to graduate this semester but I can't even think about my classes right now.

Sounds like you are having an existential crisis or you just don't want to do work?

Way too hip brother

This is exactly my problem, I really enjoy the separation of Home, work and school and now I have no job and school is also at home and I just can't get into the studying mindset. At home I want to relax.

I feel the same way. Just gotta try our best to keep on going sadly. It feels like there's not enough time to do it all now.

Holy shit I’m the same way.

I'm right there with you, I have really bad depression and anxiety. It was hard enough for me to work without a pandemic on top of that. It's hard enough being inside all the time it's the worst.

I feel you completely. I wish I could do that but I just can't. Gotta graduate and get this piece of paper. None of my classes are fun anymore and I'm just focused on getting what needs to be turned in done. Here in NJ it's been that way for awhile. Not much has changed here but we've been quarantining and we're ok without any cases in this county. I'm lucky my job is still open and I can work from home but not everybody has that same privilege. It sucks so badly right now.

Just out of curiosity, who’s your ASL professor? I struggled with ASL 3 just in general so I’m sure an online setting is 200 times harder :( I’m sorry yo

That sucks dude. Everybody's losing their jobs, it's nuts. At least you got plenty by to hike as long as those trails don't get closed. Online classes are ok if they are meant to be online. But all of these professors had to force them to be online and it shows. They're trying their best but it's just rough. Really hoping things get better for you, it's rough out there.

I have had a few online classes where they lock you out of reading any other posts until you make yours, so that isn't always viable fyi.

Exactly the way to take it. I'm just honestly trying to do the minimum in classes right now. I just want to graduate and be done. But yeah I'm just trying to keep everything a priority and at this point it's hard. Best way to do it, day by day is hard enough as it is. Hope everything gets better with you and your parents.

It honestly does. I'm thankful to be in better shape than many people in this situation, but I'm very worried about others. I hope you guys are doing ok! It's a scary time, I couldn't imagine having to bring a child into the world soon on top of that. Hang in there! I hope we get the universal pass but it seems very unlikely.

I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit: - [/r/covid19_commentary] [Who else feels like class is a waste of time right now?](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_commentary/comments/fs3am7/who_else_feels_like_class_is_a_waste_of_time/) &nbsp;*^(If you follow any of the above links, please respect the rules of reddit and don't vote in the other threads.) ^\([Info](/r/TotesMessenger) ^/ ^[Contact](/message/compose?to=/r/TotesMessenger))*

I'm taking MTH 288 (discreet math) at NVCC now and so far it's been really good. I think it's kind of fun with all the puzzles and proofs haven't been all to hard. What makes the IT 102 version difficult? Maybe GMU version of the course is just harder than novas.

That's rough, I hope you get through it ok. When I took it the second time around, I was able to get through it by going to Office Hours. Now student's do not have that option. This is outrageous. It's unfair! How can you be a student, and not have access to the resources you paid for?

I'd be happy to start one but I'd definitely need some help writing it up if anybody on here is willing to help. We really do need it, I've been more than willing to try to do my stuff, but it's kind of hard to do that when just across the Lincoln Tunnel, 30 minutes from me, Manhattan is having to use refrigerators as temporary mortuaries. I'm honestly scared of that coming over here in Jersey.

Damn dude, I'm sorry your pet passed away, that shit is rough. I had mine die awhile ago and it's still hard enough thinking about him. Hang in there. I've just been trying to get into a routine but every day feels the same. It's hard to have motivation when there's nothing to really look forward to anymore. I wish they'd give a universal pass, I really do.

What the fuck, you would really think some of these professors would change assignments like that. You obviously can't get ahold of the agency right now. I don't know what the hell they were thinking when they assigned that shit. I keep getting assigned stuff to do and I'm just here like it's pretty hard to do that when 20-30 minutes away, bodies are being carried away by FEMA trucks that are 'temporary mortuaries'. I'm just hoping to not be one of those people. &#x200B; The student body has bigger things to worry about than these fucking homework assignments. We NEED that universal pass.

This is a whole ass mood. Seriously.

I feel for you, my parents are at a big risk too and I'm far away from them right now to protect them. I hope they are ok. I don't want to put them at risk of getting sick either. I just want everything to be over and to not have to worry about school as well. It's rough. &#x200B; Hang in there. We will be ok!

That's insane dude. I feel lucky to not have that many loans out in general for 5 years of school. I remember seeing how much 2 online classes were one summer and it was like $4K without any aid. I got more aid in the summer than I did during the regular semesters which is fucking ridiculous. I really hope they do refund for the parking pass and those student fees since we can't access half of what we paid for. It's fucking ridiculous.

I agree completely. My boyfriend has had problems with his shoulder too requiring injections and it makes exercising at home harder since he doesn't have the gym resources available like he used to. I am a homebody but I just don't like being forced to be at home. I honestly wish this year would be done. Everything good is gone so there's just not much motivation to keep anybody going right now.

Agreed. I completely feel you. Tests are the literal last thing on my mind right now. I just want it to be over. Honestly I just don't want to bother with any classwork right now. Just want to pass and be done. I've been on Dean's list every semester I'm at Mason, I know I won't be for this one. Just fuck this shit.

I'm not sure, I'd love to get a mass email going of some kind if there's enough support behind it.

Damn that's rough man. I managed to get lucky to not have to go home to my parents but I'm with my boyfriend and his roommates in a tiny apartment. Just going a little stir crazy due to the lack of space. It's so hard trying to eat better right now when it's just easy to cook up some meat, so I feel you on that. Good on you for trying to get them to eat better, even though I'm sure the last thing you want to do is to cook all the time. I'm also graduating this semester and I'm just so over it.

Exactly, I am more productive on campus

Something I've found to help is changing the lighting/other stimuli in your computer/homework/study room based on the situation to help get you into the right mindset. This can be a bit tricky based on your situation but I've found it always helps, if even a little. Even something as simple as associating open windows and evening sunshine with work can quickly get you in the right mindset to do something productive.

Fuck my life THERE ARE CUPHOLDERS. And they still don’t use them.

I'm sure they would remake it if you asked, the staff are mostly students anyways

One time I ordered coffee & bagel from einsteins and it literally spilled all over my bagels like guys we can put it in the cup holders

What is this “cup holder” you speak of?

As a worker of one of the more crowded store on campus, totally the store’s fault. Go to the place in-person, show photos and ask for free food

I know they have a record function in the mobile app, this is to help you get a refund and/or a promo code for free delivery or $n Off on your next order, if you inquire about the issue they'll refund it, especially considering that this is no longer consumable.

Welp grab your spoon and dig in

Not sure if they’re still open, but Akeno Sushi did the best job of loading these things up. They’d fully cling wrap your boba so it didn’t spill anywhere, seperate your broth from your ramen/soba, much better than the time I order blaze pizza and they put it in sideways

This post prompted me to order some shakes, they only spilled a little bit but the lids stayed on so I got some free shakes thank you OP.

Welcome to the club buddy

niceee, now ik not to order drinks unless it’s bottled

Welp, the shake got shook.

Would lick the bag 😭

Ordered halal guys one time. Got zero sauce. I’m pretty sure their white sauce is a brand staple.

Looks like a refund to me.

Thought you had a half breaded piece of chicken in there

You have nobody else to blame but yourself, op

Maybe stop wasting time with starship

I've not used one of these. But if you look behind the food bag, the black thing looks like a cup holder device that could be used by the person packing the food. They just didn't.

Yea like the other person said theres a cupholder that folds out. They use em Properly whenever i order from panera, no idea why they didnt for OP

Thanks for the insightful comment man, have a good one.

stupid ass comment

what does this even mean

This technology is beyond me and clearly beyond the food packager.

I was just gonna say, we always open those when we have drink orders at Panera. Why couldn’t Shake Shack figure that out???

You comment or post was removed because it broke the subreddit #1 rule: Don't be a jerk. Please converse with other students with respect and keep in mind that Mason is an academic environment.

Incompetency comes in many forms. I stopped ordering drinks from Panera because every time I did, they would never cover the drink properly, leading to spilt drinks literally everywhere. I just grab what’s salvageable and move on, but people have to clean up these things, you’d think they’d get some complaints and fix their shit.

Actually we finally got new lids for the hot drinks. They sucked ass at first and never fit properly but now they snap on. Hopefully, your drinks will be less spilt

It actually spills through the drinking hole at the top rather than leaking through the lid.

We put stickers on top but I honestly don’t think the sticker has enough power to prevent full leakage

I Made a Rate My Professors Chrome Extension for the GMU Patriot web! &#x200B; [Rate My GMU Professors in Action](https://i.redd.it/p1tbnqx1tbi71.gif) [Link to Google Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/rate-my-gmu-professors/fmfmoojahahhnhakilofodgnlnfmagin) Hello, my name is [Jeong Min Cho](https://jeongmincho.me/) ! I am a senior computer science major student at George Mason University. After three rejections from the Google Chrome Web Store, I have finally published my extension to the store! I can proudly introduce my Google Chrome Extension called "Rate My GMU Professors". &#x200B; 🤔 What is it? Rate My GMU Professors will automatically parse professors' reviews data from Rate My Professors and display the user-friendly data on the Patriot pages. 📖 A little bit of the back story I have been thinking about this idea for a while, but I hadn't been motivated enough to work on the idea until one of my teammates from PatriotHacks 2021 (which [our team won](https://devpost.com/software/favorr)! YAY! 💪) had the same idea during the brainstorming. Although our team has chosen another idea over this idea, I thought that if I had some free time in the future, I should definitely make this. Before the starting of the Fall 2021 semester, I had some free time. While I could just sit back again enjoy the summer break, I decided to make something as a side project that helps other students. Hence, this idea perfectly fits the categories. 🕹️ How to use 1. Download Rate My GMU Professors from Chrome Web Store 2. Make sure Rate My GMU Professors are active. 3. Go to the Patriot web page. 4. Browse any classes with professors’ name 5. Now, under the professors’ names, you are able to see their Rate My Professors scores. 6. If you click the score number, you will be redirected to the professor’s Rate My Professors web page. 7. If you hover your mouse, you will be a pop-up showing the professor’s name, school, department, overall score, would-take-again percentage, level of difficulty, the total number of reviews, top tag &#x200B; ❗ Do you have any suggestions or questions? Feel free to reply here or email it to me! [jeongmincho@outlook.com](mailto:jeongmincho@outlook.com) &#x200B; Thank you for reading guys. I will see you on the GMU campus! &#x200B; &#x200B; [Search for Classes - Classic in Action](https://preview.redd.it/qmumm5evyii71.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=3f5c75a059184291452f65e7ad4813d0a6259475) EDIT 8/20/2021 - In version 1.0.3, I have added support for "Search for Classes - Classic" as u/GGX_TRIHARD_DRIVE_BY requested! It is being reviewed by Google (Usually, it takes one or two days to be reviewed), so it is not published yet. But, the feature is already implemented, so you will be able to use it in the future!! 💪 &#x200B; EDIT 8/21/2021 - Version 1.0.3 Released Enjoy! &#x200B;

Well done!! Just added the extension and it works great!

This is awesome! Just tested it and it works great. So nice to have a snapshot right on the registration page. Thank you!

You are an absolute legend mate. Imma get it asap

Is there anyway to implement this onto the classic search and not the new system?

What a stupidly freaking amazing idea! I’m jealous I didn’t think of it Lolol. Looks great dude :)

Really cool. Always awesome to see Mason students doing interesting things

Damn I wish it wasn’t my last semester. This is invaluable

Shout out to you man. What a amazing and simple thing to help us all out🤟🏾🤟🏾🤟🏾

Thanks for all the replies guys. I didn't expect this much attention from students! 😘 I am so glad to hear that many students are willing to use my extension!! 💪💪

What an absolute LEGEND!

Idk if im not only one, but the google extension is not working when it says it is active. Please helpp mee i love using this extension

yoo Jeong this is dope, nice work 🔥

Thank you for creating this. I don't know why I just found out about this today![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|facepalm)

This is so incredibly helpful! So much of the time I spend scheduling is looking up professors to ensure I’m not stuck with Peggy Hill.

I’d say to make sure you have a way of spreading this to future students. It can help a lot of people.

Damn fine job sir!

On one hand I am incredibly glad for future students who can use this, on the other hand, I'm entering into my last semester and this would have saved me so much time in years past, so I'm a bit salty nothing like this existed for me. Either way, great job!

Awesome!!!!!

Legend behavior

You may want to use an email that doesn’t link directly to your real identity

Brilliant. I wish I had this the last few semesters! Would’ve saved me so much time

ooh this is so cool, well done!

I used it on the classic PatriotWeb registration and it works great!! Thank you so much for this, it'll be very useful to lots of students.

that's cool!

Thanks!! I hope this will help you in future classes registration.

I am glad to hear that it works great! Enjoy using it in the future!

Thanks for using it !

Classic is goated

I am not sure how I can access the classic search...

Thanks, man. I may step ahead on this one, but I believe you will definitely come out with another solid idea.

Don't worry. This is my last semester, too. If I made it earlier, I could use it for myself as well :(

Same here! I love the extension, and it would great to be fixed :)

Thanks! 🔥🔥🔥

I would love to. However, since I am going to graduate in Fall 2021, I would not have many connections to newer students. I need people to spread the existence of my extension, not just me :)

Thanks! Although none of my GMU classes has taught me javascript which this extension made of :(( I had to learn by myself. 💪

Always for greater goods! Also, I am salty, too. Because if I coded this extension earlier, I could have utilized it as well. However, sadly, this is my last semester :(( But, I am sure that my extension will help future students!!

Thank you for your concern. Although it is not safe to post an email with my real name, I intend to use my Reddit account on only r/GMU. Besides, I probably add this to my resume, so I need my name somewhere on the extension!

Glad to hear that. It always feels great that my works help people!

Thanks, I will try to make it work on the classic search as well for the next version, hopefully.

Hello, I have added support for "Search for Classes - Classic" !! It is being reviewed by Google (Usually, it takes one or two days to be reviewed), so it is not published yet. But, the feature is already implemented, so you will be able to use it in the future!!

They grow up so fast

Man I miss those wheely bois.

It's enough to make a grown man cry

You’re by the red hot and blue! So cool to see a picture I can recognize lol.

I was just walking next to one on the cross walk by Auld Shabeen today lmao. Glad to see there doing well!

I missed seeing the Marshmallows

I saw one missing a wheel

Coming back from winter break like

I’m already stressed and it’s day 3 lmao

If Fallout 3 had a NoVA expansion but no, MD get one instead

I never knew how much I needed GMU memes in my life until I subscribed here.

I love this image

these memes are out of control. this is great!

Now this is content

I hope they will at least wrap up the major areas around the Mason Clock. The whole fucking campus looks like a construction zone. I was bragging to my friend how pretty our campus is during the spring when they plan to visit for my graduation but this is just sad

Nice touch adding in the green filter!

Just don’t start thinking about what it would be like if the wrecker operator came to work smashed and started tearing the wrong building down with you in it.

Point lookout was good tho

*giant claw arm smashes through side of building, opens wide to break supports, ceiling falls and traps you all*

guys im so screwed (i drew this)

thank u liverbrain, very sad 😔

It really be like that

Why’d you have to make the patriot so hot tho??? Mirin that jawline

focus on planning. Scheduling saves lives. Really love the creative expression ! &#x200B; YOU (and all my fellow gmu students reading this) GOT THIS!!

We've all been there

You just gotta make a plan and don’t stop working. No matter what your circumstances are just keep doing the school work till it’s done. You may want to take breaks and that’s fine but try to limit it to 30 mins max and get back to it. I spent 11 hours on it yesterday and I’m gonna do another 11-12 today. That’s just what it takes. But I promise as long as you don’t stop and keep making progress you will get it all done. Perseverance and determination is all it takes, you got this, never give up, never surrender.

That image is still better than the new logo

Best of luck in your final exam young padawan!

I'll make some offerings to the Mighty Dragon (Chinese Calendar) for extra luck and blessings your way tomorrow. Stay strong, calm and focused.

More like burnt

Have faith. You've got this.

GOOD LUCK, YOU GOT THIS!

Cs310? Shid i might be right there witchu

How'd it go?

Whats the update? Did you made it?

BS grading system

Just cheat 😇

Came here to say this

This is very very normal and fair

Never cook again

What kind of cheating is doable without getting caught ?? Asking for a friends?

Yes yes I agree with what you are saying my good fellow

What I did is memorize all the material for the exam, so I could literally see all the answers in my mind

That helps...

shoutout to this loving plant owner doing their best

Can't they just use a tray

Idk what building this is but that floor makes me want to cry

I feel like I can come up with at least 7 different solutions that don't involve showers and involve sunlight as well (since I know all dorms have windows). Also how can anyone knock on their door if there's no identifying information on the sign? (unless everyone already knows who the plant person is)

Hi! I own this plant. It loves showers and it's by far the best (and only) way I can water it. As you can see in the picture, the plant is droopy because it needed water [Here is what it looks like now after a nice shower](https://imgur.com/Hvm6vl6)

Doing their best? Oh honey.

Cross post to r/gardening

what dorm is this ?

Wow that plant is pretty droopy looking right now.

Where’s the sun light

Lmfao I feel like this is just kinda inconvenient.. it's a bathroom for the entire dorm hall, sometimes people might just wanna go in real quick, shower, and come out. Not take any of these extra steps for a plant that's not even theirs... cant you just let it dry outside the dorm hall or something?

The Merrifield Garden center(10 mins from GMU) has plastic trays for 3-5$! I run into a similar issue and those have helped a lot.

Someone should let them know lol, wheres the sunlight?

I am the owner of this plant. I don't have a tray and this is the only way I have to water a plant this big.

It's atrocious. It's like pixelated vomit.

One of the commons buildings, the tiles in Grayson looked exactly the same

I'm the plant person! I wrote the information after the picture was taken. The plant does not need constant sunlight, and it was only in the shower for about 20-30 minutes. Peace Lillies need lots of water and not a lot of sun :)

It looks so happy! They are definitely a pain to water sometimes, especially in a shared living space. Even Jenna Marbles waters her peace lily in the shower! 😂 If you find that the showers are ever too full or soapy or bleached, or if lockdown gets worse with this new covid variant, look into getting an Aqua Globe or two! They deliver water to it all day as it needs it without overwatering the flower.

You can get like a terracotta one at any hardware store in the gardening section. Or any plant nursery

This might be ugly, but I re-use those styrofoam boxes they send you if you order items that need to be kept cold. I drill holes in the box and use the lid at the bottom as a catch pan. Super ugly, but great for planting without spending money.

Don't know if it helps but my dad has lots of plants and he fills a 2 liter bottle of coke with water and just puts it in the soil and it slowly waters the plant.

Thanks for the advice! :D

I'll have to get one then! Thanks for the tip :P

Check out /r/houseplants if you're not subbed. You can also find pots that have like an extra chamber underneath the main pot area for the water to drain to without drowning the soil

That second part especially. The amount of heat produced from direct sunlight through those drops are quite harmful to the plants. Many physics textbooks cover this when discussing about optics.

me checking patriotweb daily to see if my lass class will be moved online or not

Man, I've gone so far as to see if my teacher's online presence is right wing or left wing to get an idea if they'll move it online or not. 2020 is all kinds of stupid.

SAAAME. Four out of my five classes are online, and there’s really no point to come onto campus just for one class so I’m holding out on this last one switching over

Me checking patriot web to see if any one of my classes is online

Mine finally changed to online, so happpy

I think classes like labs would be fucked tho

Because making petri dish culture is very different online than in person. Sometimes you gotta have that in-person experience for your major.

Anyone seen my bag? I can’t get to the Information Desk

Your bag is currently being fondled by a police robot.

Ik I can't get mine from Robinson B

@FBI - this guy right here.

Secure the bag alert! Capture the objective

Tell us if the police actually contacts you

You better pray none of the police guards are in this subreddit bruh

I’m fucking weak bruh

Lmao this gotta be a joke! Right?
