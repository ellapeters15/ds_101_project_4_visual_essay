comment,"Trump Orders Schools, Colleges to End DEI or Lose Federal Funding","One of GMU’s greatest advantages is its diversity. I have learned so much more, academically and culturally, by being surrounded by and interacting with people who come from different backgrounds than I do. I still have not heard a valid reason as to why diversity, equity, and inclusion are bad things. Edit: it’s crazy to me that people who have responded to me and DM’d me and blocked me can attend one of the most diverse schools in the country and still feel such immense fear in their hearts. You are surrounded by some of the brightest, kindest, funniest, most caring and welcoming students and faculty I’ve ever had the pleasure of working and studying with in my 35 years on this planet. But you are terrified of them because they don’t look like you, or live like you, or worship like you. That’s a skill issue on your part. Everyone deserves to share this space, and learn, and grow, and succeed, and fail, and laugh, and cry, and make friends, and feel loved and included. DEI programs exist to protect that right.",2025-01-23 10:18:01,240

comment,"Trump Orders Schools, Colleges to End DEI or Lose Federal Funding","They create teachable moments, educate the generally astute in things other than book learning, and create a more empathetic populace which in turn creates more opportunitiea to explore in subsequent generations. This by contrast opposes the GOP and Corporate Fascist State of America who need a dumb, stupid, angry, and untrusting populace led by Supreme Leader to work, die, and create untold prosperity for our suppoaed 'Betters' because they all view themselves as kings in suits rather than human like the rest of us. And they prey on Tolerance, another aspect taught from DEI, so it also requires them to control the main religious perspective through bribery, extortion, creating your own State Sanctioned religion, or political appointment (See Church of England for many of the above) to preach a 'heavenly reward' for earthly suffering. Which is coincidentially in Christian narratives as serving God for all eternity. They want the willing, stupid, and hale to work themselves dead and they'll take care of the rest through 'legal' means.",2025-01-23 18:51:54,8

comment,"Trump Orders Schools, Colleges to End DEI or Lose Federal Funding","GMU is likely to keep their diversity, if not become more diverse because of this. GMU is diverse not because of DEI programs like affirmative action, but because they employ a different philosophical strategy from other comparably prestigious universities. Most schools are strict in their admissions but once you get in you’re almost guaranteed to graduate. Getting accepted to UVA or William and Mary is more impressive than graduating. GMU is diverse because they have low standards for admission across the board. A 2.3 high school GPA and a 1000 SAT will get you in (excluding certain departments like dance.) However once you get in the classes are difficult and you have to prove yourself in order to pass everything and graduate.",2025-01-24 09:41:33,5

comment,"Trump Orders Schools, Colleges to End DEI or Lose Federal Funding","I'm going to be real. Seeing some people of color during college doesn't mean you have been surrounded by their culture lol. I don't agree with the changes, but if you think you have a greater understanding of how the world works because you interacted with the top 14% of educated people, you're sadly mistaken lol",2025-01-24 10:20:18,4
comment,"Trump Orders Schools, Colleges to End DEI or Lose Federal Funding","As an army brat growing up in incredibly diverse environments from 1980-1998 I can say the one true gift of being a third culture kid was the amount of diversity I was exposed to. From other countries’ cultures and people to the military’s own social structures (enlisted and commissioned kids had very different backgrounds but we all went to the same schools), when I landed in America for college I was shocked at the de facto economic and racial segregation in our country. Truly. White dorms and white fraternities. White sections at sporting events. White bars and clubs. If you told me then they were working on a program to help break these molds I’d be all for it back then. I’m all for it today. What’s happening today around DEI (and every other identity politic) are a series of over corrections that will send us back to the 50’s. It’s un-American and I won’t take part. We are not defined by our government, our government is defined by us. They can’t tell us who we are, we need to remember it is *us* who determines who *they* are. Fuck fascism.",2025-01-24 08:21:08,5
comment,"Trump Orders Schools, Colleges to End DEI or Lose Federal Funding",">I still have not heard a valid reason as to why diversity, equity, and inclusion are bad things. My company recently had a vendor come in an old do some DEI training through a series of small groups these past couple months and one of the questions asked in my group was.aboitvwhat evidence there was about positive impacts from DEI initiatives. The facilitator gladly shared examples from several companies, both large nationally known as well as large but local companies in the area, where DEI had a net positive effect afterwards on areas that certain people only care about (i.e., profitability).",2025-01-24 06:50:16,2
comment,"Trump Orders Schools, Colleges to End DEI or Lose Federal Funding","The argument is that people’s merit and ability to perform is not considered when making a choice for a student, employee, etc. Only of the color of their skin or where they came from is considered. Obviously, this doesn’t matter and you can have both. The solution isn’t to completely get rid of it because clearly there was a problem or it wouldn’t have been implemented in the first place.",2025-01-24 13:45:17,1
comment,"Trump Orders Schools, Colleges to End DEI or Lose Federal Funding","Because it promotes unnatural diversity.

comment,"Trump Orders Schools, Colleges to End DEI or Lose Federal Funding","Because the Department of Education falls under the executive branch, and the president has the power to enforce anything within the executive branch. I'll let you decide the answer to that. GMU does not have a much of a choice u less it has an unlimited budget from somewhere else.

comment,"Trump Orders Schools, Colleges to End DEI or Lose Federal Funding","That’s not all DEI is.

comment,"Trump Orders Schools, Colleges to End DEI or Lose Federal Funding","Here’s the thing. People, almost all of them, are more comfortable being with and picking people like them. Whether it’s common experiences or similar values or something else it’s basically human nature. But we live in a complex community with lots of groups and subgroups. Consciously and subconsciously we break folks into groups for convenience. Then we have an affinity for the ones like us. Without some structure there’s no effective way to prevent all that bias from contributing to everyday decisions including who to hire. In a nutshell killing DEI is removing that structure and promoting the return to nepotism and old boy clubs in hiring and other decision making.",2025-01-24 13:10:39,8

comment,"Trump Orders Schools, Colleges to End DEI or Lose Federal Funding","It’s only been like 5 or 6 generations since literal slavery, let alone the Jim Crow era. I don’t understand how you’ve convinced yourself that we live in some sort of post-discrimination utopia. Like why are white men overrepresented in congress versus the actual US population? Why are the 10 richest men all white? Is your assumption that women and people of color are inferior or do you just think they’re lazy?",2025-01-24 20:41:36,2
comment,"Trump Orders Schools, Colleges to End DEI or Lose Federal Funding",DEI programs are not equal opportunity programs or quotas on hiring.

comment,Protest on Campus Getting Interesting,"Saying something like this just shows a fundamental misunderstanding of what people who are pro life think. I’m pro choice, but it’s important to understand the other side so we can work most productively, even if it’s just how to best counter them. Pro lifers have their stance because they believe that a fetus is just as much of a life as a baby, usually because of religious soul stuff. Therefore, obviously killing babies would be bad. You likely agree with them on the fact killing babies is bad, you just disagree about where to draw the line at what a person is. I think you’re alluding towards “my body my choice” type ideas being ironic from someone who is pro life, but someone who is pro life doesn’t think you’re potentially killing somebody when doing a circumcision. That being said, your comment doesn’t make sense because these people are saying we SHOULDNT do something (advocating for a negative) which is the same as what pro lifers are doing.",2023-10-20 16:05:22,3

I made a friend on the first day of class, and things went well at first. By the second week, they kept asking me for help with hw assignments and for recordings of the lectures when they weren't there. I didn’t help with the hw I just guided them. I only sent one lecture recording, and when it became a pattern, I eventually stopped. On Monday of this week, they texted me at 8 AM to come to my dorm and use my printer. Yes, I have my own printer. I didn't see the text right away as I was sleeping at that time and bro there's printers on campus to use.

comment,Be careful about who you make friends with bro 💀,"Same thing happened to me. I made friends with this group of girls and they were constantly asking me to buy them food saying that they come from low income families and they don’t have enough. I would always cave in. Eventually they started taking things from my dorm without my permission- snacks, drinks, clothes, books. They also asked me to borrow my notes and books from classes I’d already taken. Came to find out they were trying to sell the same books on the college Facebook page the next semester. I still didn’t learn my lesson. When I moved off campus, 2 of the girls came over. She was also friends with my roommate. It was super late, I was asleep. My parents had just bought me groceries, the girls emptied my fridge and took everything home. Not to mention my parents had helped them out before, giving them rides multiple times. When I confronted the girls, they got mad at me. I cut them off and then they tried to turn others against me bc I wouldn’t let them take advantage of me anymore. Don’t over extend yourself, maintain boundaries and look out for selfish people!",2025-02-15 00:41:30,4
comment,Be careful about who you make friends with bro 💀,"The amount of social climbers at Mason is absurd. Seems nice at first, but then they start wanting homework answers and help on exams. I try to guide them to the right answer without giving it away so they actually learn. During an accounting exam not too long ago, I had a guy next to me try to get answers off me during an exam. Touched his shoe with my shoe to get my attention, then typed on his laptop screen: “can I see that for 5 minutes?”. Guy was really on the edge with the professor and TA proctoring the exam. I just ignored him and immediately turned my stuff in and left.",2025-02-15 10:40:51,4

comment,Be careful about who you make friends with bro 💀,"Different situation but similar. When I was at VCU in math class, I was talking to another guy and found out we lived within a few blocks of each other. So, we started walking to and from class together. Within 1-2 days, I realised all this dude wanted to talk about was Rush. That's all the conversations were about, lol. How much he loved them. How they were the greatest band ever, etc. I ended up having to walk a different way home after that because while I like Rush, I don't care about them enough to talk about more than Tom Sawyer. Oh, also, this was 2012. Decades after they were a huge deal, lol. Beware indeed!",2025-02-15 11:21:06,3

comment,Graffiti at exploratory this morning,"Not with that attitude. You gotta recognize the change that has happened and how people in our government are actively back peddling rights. You just gotta keep paying attention, at least when it isn't too mentally taxing. Change happens when we band together and stand up for what we believe in. It's easy to fall down the nihilistic thought abyss. It's harder to stand up and do the work. Everything worth doing is hard. People are doing the work. You just have to look. Yeah, protests on campus get annoying. You wanna focus on school, go for it. But don't dismiss people who are gonna be actively fighting for their lives with what this administration is doing. There is enough history in the past 100 years showing how people fought for their rights to vote, to marry, to simply exist. Do not obey in advance. Use your rights.

comment,My prof is savage lmao,"what I’d do: Go back and look at the syllabus to see whether it describes how the professor grades. If it doesn’t, and grading was never discussed in class, then I’d consider going back to the prof and present findings. If the syllabus DOES state the prof’s grading policy (and it almost certainly does), and/or the prof presented grading during class, then, well, if it’s that important to get the better grade, I’d consider tell the prof that I’ll be back next semester to try for that better grade, and thank the prof for their time responding. And that time, work hard and get the A+. The Plus comes because you read the syllabus, paying attention in class, asking questions, helping others, maybe forming a study group, and of course showing up to class on time, prepared, turn your work in early or on time, and you study and do well on exams. It’s really very simple.",2022-12-15 10:49:19,1

Once it clicked, you had nothing but As, but you failed the first test. You're willing to put in extra work to make up for that.

comment,Happy Monday Everyone,"He was “investigated” under extremely shady premises with crazy boundaries (only like 2 witnesses questioned) for ~7 days.

But I’m nobody.",2019-03-25 12:06:06,26
comment,Happy Monday Everyone,"Yes, the FBI held two separate investigations involving the matter and found no evidence to conclude that Kavanough was guilty. In one they found that one of the accusers friends fabricated the entire thing. Do I think he’s a scum bag? Yeah Do I agree with his politics? NAH Is it fair to ignore evidence and react based on how we feel, or what we think of a person? Nah I think it’ll bring more money and reputation(good and bad) to Mason and thus is an overall good thing. Just my 2 cents",2019-03-25 12:17:25,19

comment,Happy Monday Everyone,"Just because someone is ""accused"" of something means nothing. ""innocent until proven guilty"" is the way our criminal justice system works. The victim in question was given every opportunity to tell her story and give witnesses that could corroborate it, her own best friend that she said was at the party with her had no recollection of Kavanaugh being there or anything like that happening. Anyone can go around and ""accuse"" someone of something, doesn't mean you did it.",2019-03-25 13:19:40,14

For example, they changed the Information Technology degree twice while I was in that major, adding new requirements effective immediately regardless of catalog year. This added an extra year almost to my school career. They also increased tuition more than other schools. They sold names of buildings to businesses, like really? Eagle Bank Arena? Verizon Center? They regularly closed off huge sections of the parking lot for a circus that had nothing to do with the student body, but instead made parking unbearable. Everything they did was money motivated and I almost never saw a decision that put the students first. Other schools actually care about their student body.",2020-07-21 14:27:57,11

None of that is unique to Mason. The only real gripe I think I’ve seen is about Koch and Kavanaugh, both completely fair imo. Otherwise the problems are pretty much universal or self created (i.e.: join a club if you can’t make friends easy). Also complaining about your university is barely a hot take, everyone I know who went to college is either super preppy and bleeds X college’s school colors, or loves to complain about how shit it was.",2020-07-21 14:09:48,40

comment,"Hate it or love it, facts","My experience is a decade old now, but I joined the men's crew club (now coed) with 0 rowing experience the first week of my freshman year and it became the framework of my social life at Mason. By the end of sophomore year my roommates were rowers, I was eating almost all my meals with rowers, and I was going to crew parties. We were pretty chill, and luckily had a house (might still) literally 2 blocks north of campus on University Dr. I lived there my senior year. Joining that club got me into and kept me in the best shape of my life, gave me a pretty wide circle of not just friends but academic resources through people, allowed me to travel to places I otherwise wouldn't have gone to, and ended up being the defining part of my college experience. We definitely didn't bleed green and gold, we were just a bunch of dudes and a few girls who liked torturing ourselves. I honestly don't know what I would've done without it. Joined a frat and been fat, drunk, and stupid I guess. That particular club took a lot of time and dedication, and I voluntarily gave most of my free time to it. But it could be any club. At the time there were like 20 club sports you could choose at Mason, and you could have that experience with any of them. But it does take that initial effort to put yourself out there.",2020-07-21 17:45:15,6

Dining.. tolerable, more so Parking.. 200/year, not 700/400 but also not a km off campus center Board is 1/2 than what we pay even on private schools. In the end Mason is not for the 'college experience', but it is for researchers who want to grow in their field and if you want anything more you're wasting \[your\] time and money. As for pride, mason lacks it hard. Hard criticism: there is no unity in our diversity. However we have a lot of potential and the work you put into it will return fold.",2020-07-21 21:33:27,2

comment,"Hate it or love it, facts","That’s a bit extreme lol, universities have had corporate sponsors for decades and as far as I can see there’s nothing even remotely resembling the scenario that you described at any of them. Anyways, nearly every major university’s stadium has corporate sponsors and it’s a plus if anything that part of the team funding is coming from outside rather than 100% from our tuition dollars. As for being hard on money, nearly every public institution is, except for an elite handful, so it’s literally free money for us that the company provides for exposure of their name. As long as the company itself isn’t distasteful, I don’t see any issue.",2020-07-21 15:30:04,4

comment,"Hate it or love it, facts","*the picture you described as being the next step is extreme; the “McDonald’s University” and the “billboards all over campus”. Don’t twist my words also unrelated, but since you brought it up, if you hate capitalism so much why not go elsewhere? And again don’t twist this to what some far-righters say every time someone wants to discuss social injustices or protest during the anthem, they’re basically saying if you find any faults in the country that you wanna improve you should leave. So before you try to frame what I’m saying as that, that’s not what I’m saying. Now, the U.S. was fundamentally founded on capitalism so if that something that you don’t agree with that’s your choice, but in this case it is fair to say why not go elsewhere then?",2020-07-21 15:54:12,-3
comment,"Hate it or love it, facts","I would love to move to a more socialist country, but it’s not that easy to just move. And yes, you are saying the same as the far righters. So someone living in a country can’t find any faults with it apparently. And this isn’t unrelated to capitalism, the culture of capitalism is prioritizing money above all else. Apparently I need to worship it and never critique it in order to live here.",2020-07-21 17:44:06,1
comment,"Hate it or love it, facts","One question, what exactly is the university prioritizing money over when they get corporate sponsorships on a couple buildings? Is there something we’re losing? As for the last statement, not at all, I know very much that there’s problems with capitalism, but the thing is there’s no “perfect” system and the pros to cons ratio of this one is better than the others. There’s a reason why we have more technological, scientific, medical, you name it, advances than any other free country in the world, and all of these come from the private sector (capitalism!). There’s a reason why Amazon, Microsoft, Netflix, Apple, Google, Twitter, hell even the very platform we’re having this discussion on right now, and pretty much any other major revolutionary company, all originated in the U.S. There’s a reason why our top universities are more prestigious than those of other Western countries even though their top institutions have been around a lot longer. There’s a reason we consistently make the most cutting-edge scientific discoveries and accomplishments. There’s a reason why people from every other country come here for world-renown-expert medical treatment for rare diseases or when their doctors don’t have any answers. And finally, there is a reason why people from all over the world want to immigrate to “America”. I’m neither white, even remotely wealthy, nor a natural-born American; I immigrated here with my family, leaving our relatively well-off life and coming here where we were essentially poor for the first decade plus, so to be clear this is not some patriotism-blinded view of the U.S. So that said, we have our fair share of problems like any other country, and constructively critiquing specifics of where you think capitalism or any aspects of the U.S. fall short, in order to improve it (as every engaged citizen should do), is one thing, but completely trashing it as a concept altogether (what you basically did about capitalism, and what many do regarding the U.S. as a whole) is another.",2020-07-21 18:23:50,1

comment,GMU Slander,"I have ideas to give you for the next slander, these are just suggestions, and I am writing on the top of my head. I know some of these are inevitable for any university, but they still make a good slander. The price for operating public scooters is kinda high, also, the public electric scooters have an electric fence that turns off the motor when you are in the center of campus. The ambulance and other emergency services gets called every night for something happening on campus. Freshmen had to take a quiz called “Perspective” and it was a sour attempt at talking about politics, bias, and frankly wasted everyone’s time. I see the delivery bots get themselves stuck in sticky situations where only human intervention can set them free. The protesters at Southside or the Johnson Center, they just show up and bother everyone. The campus trashcans aren’t emptied enough, so swarms of bees start circling near the trashcans. There are people who walk up to you and recruit you for something. At nighttime, some of the people in the dorm can get loud. The process of even applying for this university was extremely laborious and so much paperwork was involved.",2023-09-03 14:06:32,1

post,Kallaco seems really suspicious and could be scamming GMU,"Kallaco seems really suspicious and could be scamming GMU So as everyone is waiting for this supposed email from Kallaco for covid testing. My friends and I started looking into them, the more we look into this mystery company the more suspicious it looks. Here’s what we have found, good and bad: - The domain for their website is only 40 days old. - Their [website](https://kalla.co) looks like it was made on squarespace in 30 minutes. There are grammar errors and it looks more like a template than anything. - Their partner company “HealthECO” only has 11 followers on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/TheHealthEco?s=21) and joined in March 2020. (Could be a new social media campaign or something) - HealthECO partner Jami Youmans, when her picture is reverse image searched it only shows up on one website and its a Society for Physician Entrepreneurs that you can simply pay $100 to join. However, Her [Linked in page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jamiyoumans) checks out for HealthECO. - When we reverse searched some of the others pictured on their website. The results led us to 404 errors and dead websites. - Upon searching the CEO’s name “John Spivey, Kallaco” we can go to their empty [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/kallaco) profile where only 2 employees are listed and very little information is provided - There’s a [video](http://Www.vimeo.com/user78424920) about Kallaco but posted 4 weeks ago, and the CEO’s face is never shown. - At the end of the video he’s showcasing, what is supposedly the Kallaco app but when opened it asks if he wants to allow StrataClear permissions and after that the app showed a login page for Kallaco. However, when searched on the the app store for either name, nothing comes up. - When searching for “StrataClear” the only results are covid testing by other companies. - I called the phone number provided on their linkedin and was greeted by a bot with the usual “press 1 to so and so” but didn’t go any further than the automated response. - the fact that, apparently, they can ship covid tests within 24 hours of you requesting it, and anywhere in the country, seems too good to be true. - The people who are partnered can be found on Linkedin and their pages check out with the info on Kallaco. - Their motto is apparently: “The people we care about the most, are the people who care the most about their people” - VCU is apparently using Kallaco and people have been waiting weeks for their tests to even arrive. While this seems like a scam since we can’t find anything informative or reliable about Kallaco, most of the partners listed are real and their info checks out, but there are still a ton of red flags. Seems like GMU selected the lowest bidding company for Covid testing, and Kallaco is either a 4 week old startup company that is way over ambitious. Or its just a scam and GMU bought it. If it ends up not being a scam, realistically, I don’t think the tests will arrive before the August 5th deadline. I would highly recommend going and getting a test done with your primary care physician or find a health clinic that offers them and can be covered by your insurance. GMU started this process way too late with a company that probably can’t handle the high demand anyway. Stay safe everyone and lets hope this doesn’t turn into a crapshoot (this is GMU we’re talking about so we all know the odds of that) TL;DR Kallaco is a 4 week old startup company that is really suspicious and possibly over ambitious. Or it’s a scam. We’ll have to wait and see. Edit: grammar",2020-07-29 18:27:12,333

comment,Kallaco seems really suspicious and could be scamming GMU,"I can’t believe VCU is really using this scam to get tests. With just a few clicks anyone can see how sketchy this company is; they’re putting a lot of people at risk for getting their information stolen. Even if it is an ‘ambitious startup,’ there’s no way stuff wouldn’t check out like it did here. Personally I think it was only a matter of time for these companies to appear. They’re basically data mining but with serious personal information like health insurance, Social Security Numbers, etc (if they ask for it.) A lot of people who are desperate to get a test are likely to go to these kinds of sites and spill their information, and they probably wouldn’t think twice about it. It’s really just like a phone scam. It makes me nervous for other schools and their faction and staff who will be just like VCU in the next coming months.",2020-07-29 20:59:02,19

The ""we're hiring"" link takes you to a simple contact us form. No address or phone numbers anywhere to be found. I have used local services in my area that have 2 or fewer employees that have more polished and useful websites.

In my case, mine went from negative to sample rejected. So now we have no idea if we're actually clear or not and might have just exposed each other and may be the start of an outbreak in Richmond. This company is not to be trusted. Good luck GMU friends!",2020-07-31 14:08:03,6
comment,Kallaco seems really suspicious and could be scamming GMU,"Hey there, just wanted to drop in to share what I know thus far. I have twins heading to college as freshmen; 1 to VCU & the other to GMU. The test kit for the VCU kid was ordered Sat 7/25 and arrived in the evening via FedEx on Wed. 7/29. Test kit ordered for GMU kid on Tues 7/28 and waiting for arrival. So, we **did** actually receive the kit as well, and hopefully, everything else (results) is legit. With that said, I wanted to just throw a few tips out there for those that may be confused by the terrible instructions enclosed with the kit. The test itself is an easy throat swab, be careful not to spill the liquid in the tube. Wash hands, swab the throat, stick it in the tube, break it off at the perforation (take the lid off the tube just prior to swabbing), put the lid on. Voila, that part's easy. The slightly confusing part is the labeling as the directions are far from clear. On the enclosed paper, there is a small sticker with the student's name and DOB preprinted. Write the date and time of swab on the lab request form **AND ON THE LITTLE STICKER**. (There is no blank for it, just write in on there) You do **not** have to write on the label that is already on the tube! You will remove the sticker (with name, DOB, time & date) and **cover up the sticker already on the tube**. I promise this is the way to do it even though the enclosed instructions really do suck and are unclear. I have been an RN for over 25 years and the process is pretty standard for any specimen labeling. I hope everyone gets their kits, gets negative results, and is able to venture off to college. For all the Freshmen out there, may the force be with you. You'll have had the most challenging HS senior year/summer/start of the college experience, I can't imagine how crazy this must be for you all. Best of luck to everyone out there!

comment,Kallaco seems really suspicious and could be scamming GMU,"It’s a tracking app. Once you do the testing and download the app, your school can track exactly where you are and even set the system up to alert the dean (or whoever) that too many students are gathering together. So, if your school is adding this app to their conduct code requirement, you are, in all likelihood, giving the school permission to track your phone. Watch the sales video and it explains how students are tracked. If your school is chill and won’t bring you up on conduct charges for being at a party that has too many students then no biggie. But, if your school is aggressive with policy, you should be aware of what this app is and can do with your info. https://vimeo.com/434498160",2020-08-01 17:44:27,2

comment,Kallaco seems really suspicious and could be scamming GMU,"The Kallaco Test (ThermoFisher TaqPath COVID-19 Combo Kit) was NOT EUA-approved by the FDA for home specimen collection. (Read the full FDA email here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lJttIV6fDHUGRFm44-wIH85LGLWee1ei/view?link_id=0&can_id=e27329b886928744f73825c77c92b8e3&source=email-concerns-about-faulty-testing-of-students-at-mason&email_referrer=email_899490&email_subject=gmu-aaup-response-to-president-washington-re-kallaco-testing The CDC has published guidelines for collecting COVID-19 samples. This CDC document explicitly states that oropharyngeal (OP) specimens (i.e., throat swabs) must be collected by healthcare providers to be acceptable. By contrast, the Kallaco-ThermoFisher test kit required students to perform an oropharyngeal (OP) specimen collection (throat swab) at home, in violation of CDC guidelines. For the full guidelines visit: https://bit.ly/3j59iYw On August 17, 2020, the FDA released an advisory titled “Risk of Inaccurate Results with ThermoFisher Scientific TaqPath COVID-19 Combo Kit” (the now-infamous Kallaco test).

In order to be claimed as a dependent half your living expenses have to be paid for. That almost certainly adds up to more than $1200 per year.,2020-04-20 07:31:30,-9

comment,The harsh reality,"Spoken like someone born with a silver spoon in your mouth. Now, it's not necessarily fair for me to judge you based upon the comment, but the simple fact is that ""dependent"" simply means you are supported in some way or at least someone is ""claiming"" they are supporting you. But an extremely poor family can still ""support"" a college-age student in enough qualifying ways while that student is working 40 hours a week and in school part-time and barely scraping by because the family is quite poor to begin with. In large part, such a situation is often created due to ""loans"" of some sort when it comes to paying for school. In other words, being a ""dependent"" has zero bearing on whether or not someone might need a stimulus check.",2020-04-20 10:30:50,9
comment,The harsh reality,"Isn't the goal to become independant? Generally, somebody that is dependant on someone else is dependant because they don't have the resources to support themselves.

comment,The harsh reality,It passed house already. Both the treasury and Trump have helped Dems push this bill.

comment,The harsh reality,"Yeah, I was expecting about $500-$700 from the previous one. Perhaps it has to do with being used to my current financial situation, but this amount would feel very strange to have coming in from seemingly out of nowhere.

comment,The harsh reality,"It is only through July 31st. In my state you can get $300 a week max for unemployment, but the $600 is an additional amount provided on the federal level.

If it comes down to it, don't be afraid to go through a recruiting agency. They can find you positions a lot quicker than you can on your own.

comment,🤷🏼‍♂️,"My perspective is that you learn how to learn. This is especially true for engineers and I hear veterans say it all the time. Graduate level it gets even worse, for lack of a better term. Only class I really picture that you need closer feedback are language classes, but a lot of technology these days can erode that requirement. Also, I really do prefer labs in person. Simulation is not the same. I digress.",2020-10-23 13:38:40,5

comment,🤷🏼‍♂️,"The purpose of universities isn’t teaching, but *credentialing*. A diploma is proof that the university has tested you on the subject matter of a field and believes that you understand it. How well? See GPA, and grades in individual classes. And universities *themselves* are evaluated to ensure that those decisions are trustworthy. [ABET accreditation](https://www.abet.org/accreditation/) is the process by which a university established an educational program that meets certain quality standards - as opposed to, say, a diploma mill that is prepared to give anybody a degree without proper testing. Note that all of these objectives could be met without actually teaching anything. Lots of certificate programs exist that *only* perform testing, based on knowledge that test-takers are expected to acquire on their own. And many professions require both. Doctors must graduate from an accredited medical school *and* pass board exams. Lawyers must graduate from accredited law schools *and* pass a bar exam. Etc.",2020-10-25 10:58:43,1

post,Adios... it's been real,"Adios... it's been real In fall 2012, I started at GMU as a 38-year-old, part-time student with aspirations of studying electrical engineering. I enrolled in one class - and dropped it after two weeks. (During our first meeting, my academic advisor said: ""Oh, you have a master's in computer science? You can start in the EE track wherever you want!"" ... which turned out to be absurdly wrong. I picked ECE 220, which has a prerequisite of ECE 201, which of course I hadn't taken. I was instantly in over my head. Not a great start.) I started again in spring 2013 the *right* way - taking ECE 201, and also Math 114 (Calculus II). (Academic advisor: ""You already have credit for Calculus II, why take it again?"" Answer: Because I took it *20 years ago* and didn't do well, and I think I need to *actually know* this stuff this time.) Much better start. My first few years, I completed five classes per year (two fall/spring, one summer). Over time, the difficulty of the material increased; my career picked up steam; my family required more attention; and I ran out of summer classes that I could take for meaningful credit. My course load dropped to two classes a year, which was productive but painfully slow. I chipped away at a BSEE degree for *eight years*. This afternoon, I took my last final exam. I'm done. (I was admitted to the BSEE / MSEE program and completed some 500- and 600-level classes, but ultimately decided not to continue. I will still be learning - but plan to spend 2021 deep-diving into machine learning, including professional certifications.) A few memories: * I experienced both wonderful and terrible instructors. I met both talented and unmotivated classmates. I think that I learned something from all of them. Along the way, I developed friends in my classes, but all too briefly; they all cruised past me and graduated while I continued to plug away slowly. * I stressed about my grades, sometimes pretty seriously. I dropped classes when I could have muddled through and passed with B/C, simply because it was more important to me to *learn the actual material* than to get through it quickly. If I'd known how long and how strenuous the program would be, I wouldn't have started - but I'm glad I didn't, because I'm glad I did. Electrical engineering is a hell of a great topic. * I spent far too much time and money in the Northern Neck Starbucks. For the rest of my life, I will cherish the idea of a local 24/7 cafe. * After spending about five years choking down substandard and overpriced food from the (old) JC food court, I discovered Ike's, and then spent a bunch of late nights there with a textbook. * I served on the Honor Committee and tried my absolute best to be fair to students, as did all of the other committee members I met. (Want to avoid an honor code charge in CS classes? *Do your own work* and don't even look at Stack or Chegg in the context of your assignments. I cannot stress this enough: it's really that simple.) * I participated in SRCT - a wonderful organization - and donated a project (GMUCal) to help students create calendar entries for their classes. * I had a terrible experience with one of the lower-level ECE labs - only because the lab manual was, like, 15 pages *total* and a complete waste of time. (""Build this circuit. Measure that voltage. The End."") It was tragic because the class covered great material, but the lab was trivial and boring. I ended up writing a new lab manual for the class... which, hopefully, makes it a worthwhile experience. * Our senior design project was a student-led effort to create an infrared laser pointer to control a computing environment. I enjoyed functioning as part of a skilled engineering team - we had our ups and downs, and we put *way* too much time and money into it, but we succeeded and learned a lot. Easily the best experience of the ECE program. * Finishing the program with a year of COVID and distance learning has been disappointing, but... ultimately, not *that* different. The material is the same; the assignments and labs and projects and exams are the same; lectures are still 85 minutes long. I *loved* being able to watch the lectures on my own time, and the ability to pause and reverse and replay bits when needed. But I get that this model doesn't work for some people, and I missed the feeling of camaraderie with classmates. A word of advice: I don't think that GMU, or universities in general, will ever be ""normal"" in the pre-2020 sense again - distance learning is here to stay. Accepting it and learning to excel in that model will help you a great deal. In total, GMU has been a great experience. I hope that everyone sets and achieves high academic goals and uses their academic training to advance the world, in whatever ways you can and want. Good luck to you all, Patriots.

comment,Adios... it's been real,Congratulations. I’m happy for you. I think this post and others similar goes to show how people’s experiences at Mason don’t foreshadow others. They are good and bad qualities of any school.

I graduate next semester and I am still thinking about what I want to do. I know how important it is to have something lined up but it’s also good to have periods where I allow myself to take in a semester or experience.

If someone held a gun to my head and told me to differentiate something I would just reach over and pull the trigger for them. I've considered taking the classes again, but am trying Khan Academy to see if I can figure it out. The math courses terrify me a bit - and I got A's in Calc I/II back when it was still being taught by Newton (or maybe on a Newton).

post,GMU Police Officers Sue GMU for Police Corruption,"GMU Police Officers Sue GMU for Police Corruption There was a press release given on Friday where GMU Police Officers are suing GMU for a culture of police corruption. It says that GMU officers tried to report wrongdoing, but instead of a proper investigation, the reporting officers got punished. Link to PDF here: [http://www.fairfaxunderground.com/forum/file.php?2,file=449099,filename=PRESS\_RELEASE\_-\_03.26.2021.pdf](http://www.fairfaxunderground.com/forum/file.php?2,file=449099,filename=PRESS_RELEASE_-_03.26.2021.pdf) Full text below: March 26, 2021 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Media Contact: J. Caleb Jones, Esq. 703-771-4671 jcjones@simmsshowerslaw.com GMU OFFICERS FILE COMPLAINT ALLEGING PATTERN AND PRACTICE OF POLICE CORRUPTION AT GMU, SEEKING $5,620,000 Case No. 2021-03914 On March 15, 2021, two George Mason University (GMU) police officers filed a suit in Fairfax Circuit Court alleging a pattern and practice of police corruption at GMU. The officers’ complaint alleges retaliation for reporting a use of excessive force by a GMU police officer against a handcuffed arrestee, who was taken into custody for a non-violent offense on January 28, 2018, at the EagleBank Arena on the Fairfax GMU campus. In addition to the excessive force, the two officers noted their suspicion that the official written police report of the incident contained deliberately fabricated facts, designed to place blame on the arrestee for the force used and cover up the actions of the officer by describing violence of the arrestee against officers, which the body-worn camera video does not corroborate. Counsel for the officers has been able to contact the arrestee, who has confirmed in a sworn affidavit that the facts in the police report describing his attempts to “kick, bite, and strike officers” are not true, even during the short moments when the officer’s body-worn camera does not directly capture the arrestee and the officer. The use of excessive force was captured on the body-worn camera of an officer at a time when the body-worn camera system was first being introduced at GMU. As such, most GMU police officers did not know that their actions were regularly being recorded. As a result of the plaintiffs’ attempts to have these allegations of excessive force and false police report properly investigated, GMU has removed the plaintiffs from job duties, demoted or transferred them, and even defamed an officer before the Fairfax County Commonwealth’s Attorney, claiming that he was found to be guilty of dishonesty in his role at the department. The officers’ complaint alleges that multiple departments and senior administrators at GMU, up to and including the Office of the President, participated in the cover-up, punishment, and retaliation of the two officers who reported this matter in good faith. Sworn testimony already taken from some defendants supports many of these claims. In contrast to the treatment of the reporting officers, the officer who was allegedly recorded using excessive force has since been promoted twice; this officer now holds a significant supervisory position in the department. At the time of the incident in the video, presently known information seems to suggest this officer reported directly to the GMU Chief of Police. He now directly reports to one of the co-defendants involved in the retaliation of the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs have attempted to correct these wrongful actions through ordinary channels, to no avail. One plaintiff was not able to successfully challenge his discipline through the Virginia State Office of Equal Employment and Dispute Resolution (EEDR). In his matter, the hearing officer did not allow the video of the incident to be included as evidence. The other plaintiff was able to successfully challenge his discipline before the EEDR on the same set of facts. In his matter, the hearing officer did allow the video of the incident to be included as evidence. Despite limited relief – receiving an order from a state official for GMU to return the officer’s previous job duties to him – GMU has refused to return this officer to his previous position. Due to the impossibility of finding relief through ordinary internal channels, the officers have filed a complaint in the Circuit Court of Fairfax County, through their attorneys at Simms Showers, LLP, in Leesburg, Virginia. Their complaint seeks to enforce the order of the hearing officer of the EEDR, and seeks equitable relief and monetary damages for whistleblower retaliation, conspiracy to obstruct justice, defamation, conspiracy to defame, fraud, conspiracy to defraud, and breach of contract. Plaintiffs have alleged total damages of $5,620,000. Because GMU has strenuously fought against both a proper investigation of this matter, and strenuously fought to keep the undisputed facts from public view, the plaintiffs, through their counsel, deliver this press release so that both this matter and the continuing pattern of police corruption at GMU receive the appropriate light of public scrutiny.",2021-03-28 00:28:12,279

They actually seemed pretty pissed off that we hadn't done anything wrong.

comment,GMU Police Officers Sue GMU for Police Corruption,"To the individuals who anonymously call my firm and encourage us to keep investigating GMU because of the poor environment on campus, thank you for your calls. Don't worry. We are, and no, we have no plans to stop. Though ""settlement"" can always be an outcome of a litigation, we have zero plans to just roll over in our settlement. Additionally, we are not merely investigating this single incident of police misconduct. We are particularly concerned about the strange University Life policies that outlaws gatherings of more than 10 people ""whether planned or spontaneous."" This policy is quite puzzling, and I am interested in it. I am particularly interested about whether it was a policy that was ""on the books,"" at GMU, yet never enforced, or whether it was a policy with serious (and biased) enforcement. In the meantime, make the most of your time at Mason (despite the trouble). Make friends. Take your classes. Do well. Realize you're there to learn. Don't do drugs.

comment,GMU Police Officers Sue GMU for Police Corruption,"**Police Corruption Allegations** \- It should be noted that what we are challenging here is the GMU PD's failure to properly investigate a good-faith allegation of wrongful conduct, which could encompass a felony (deliberate falsification of a public record). However, the issues are complex. The officer whose name was on the report was making his first arrest of his career. That officer actually complained to his superior about the excessive force at the time, and that complaint went nowhere (paragraph 98 of the Complaint). That report was required to be approved by his supervisor to a greater extent than a normal officer, and for these reasons, we do not know who actually wrote these false statements, which is why we are not releasing the names of the other officers in question. We do not know if pressure was placed on the officer, if another superior officer added the false statements under his name, or if this officer incorrectly took the word of other officers and recorded them as his own observations, which allowed the other GMU PD officers and administrators to take advantage of a genuine mistake. It's all in play, and we really don't know what's going on. Only through discovery and depositions will we (possibly) find out.",2021-03-28 14:52:49,9
comment,GMU Police Officers Sue GMU for Police Corruption,"**What now?** \- This is a big problem and the solution is not going to be easy. There is a big problem of corruption at GMU, and it is a danger to GMU officers, GMU students, and the public at large. (Trust me. I know. This is not my only case involving GMU.) The only way this is going to get better is if EVERYONE (GMU administrators, GMU Police, and GMU Students) starts to act in the way they SHOULD act. So start doing that now, at every moment of every day, including how you react to reading this stuff. That's going to be very hard to know how to do that, but it is like the good book says: >""Check it out: I am sending you out as sheep in the midst of wolves, so be wise as serpents and innocent as doves. (Matthew 10:16, modified by my own translation)"" It is very difficult when someone is ""in the midst of wolves"" to be ""wise as serpents and innocent as doves,"" and no one is perfect. That's why I feel for my ""defendant"" clients just as much as I do for my ""plaintiff"" clients. Also, it is worth remembering that ""fighting wolves"" doesn't make you ""innocent as doves."" Just because your reaction can be described as ""protest"" doesn't mean that you are in the right, even if the person or organization you are protesting is in the wrong. Wolves fight wolves, too, you know. The only bit of advice I can give that will apply to everyone is this: Tell the truth. Don't exaggerate. Don't pass off your ""interpretation"" or ""speculation"" as ""observation."" Don't gossip, and for goodness sake, NEVER LIE. Ordinary people make mistakes, but only wolves lie. So never lie. The amount of lies I have seen from GMU is the reason that this is happening. And as the good book also says: >The end of all things is at hand; therefore be self-controlled and sober-minded for the sake of your prayers. Above all, keep loving one another earnestly, since love covers a multitude of sins. (1 Peter 4:7-8) And if you ever find yourself in a pickle, or need help due to the wrongdoing of others, the good book ALSO says: >Do your best to speed \[J. Caleb Jones\] the lawyer and \[Simms Showers, LLP\] on their way; see that they lack nothing.

comment,GMU Police Officers Sue GMU for Police Corruption,"**The Real Problem Here** \- This situation that the officers reported was bad, but the real problem here is what happened afterwards. I represent many officers in many different jurisdictions and situations. When life gets too crazy for ordinary citizens, they call ""the police."" That's why being an officer is tough. At the end of the day, officers are ordinary people. Some are absolutely amazing. Most are pretty good. Some are quite average. A few are downright malicious. In other words, they are ordinary people. When ordinary people mess up in their jobs -- whether they be doctors or lawyer or finance workers or construction workers or police officers -- the best thing is for that mistake to be appropriately identified, documented, and corrected, and for the one who messed up to be appropriately chastised (either in public or private depending on the magnitude of the offense), and get the remediation and training they need so that it doesn't happen again. That's what should have happened. But it didn't. Instead, what we've found is a culture at GMU that circles the wagons, protects those who do wrong, and punishes those who seek appropriate correction. THAT is the real problem here, and THAT is why we have taken the extraordinary step of going public with this complaint and press release.",2021-03-28 15:01:16,6
comment,GMU Police Officers Sue GMU for Police Corruption,"**Defamation** \- This was one of the most shocking actions for me personally. Plaintiff 2 was the one who reported the wrongdoing up the chain of command and was demoted as a result of his actions. He was the one who did not receive relief from the EEDR process, in large part (in my opinion) because the video of the wrongdoing was not allowed to be introduced as evidence in the hearing. Despite failing to get relief and despite his punishment being left in place, about 6 months after the conclusion of the matter, the GMU PD gave him notice that he was placed on the ""Brady List"" at Fairfax County PD. This is an informal list of officers created due to a series of Supreme Court cases, in which their pattern of dishonesty creates exculpatory evidence of criminal defendants. It truly is a black mark on his career for all time if the matter is not corrected. It is an extremely big deal and one of the biggest vindictive acts of fear imposed by the GMU PD in this entire dirty episode.",2021-03-28 14:52:17,5
comment,GMU Police Officers Sue GMU for Police Corruption,"**Damages**. The number of $5.6 million is actually quite complicated. There are two plaintiffs, six defendants (GMU is one, the rest are GMU employees and administrators, and one is a ""John Doe,"" due to our suspicion that more bad actors will be found and added to the complaint later.) When drafting a complaint, if you don't ask for it, you simply won't get it. This number should not be seen as the money the plaintiffs are attempting to ""grab."" Instead, it is a complex number that factors in punitive damages (which are designed to punish a wrongdoer, but are capped at $350,000 by state law), compensatory damages (paying the plaintiffs back for what has been taken from them), equitable damages (turning a bad action into some sort of ""this is the amount of money that we can fairly equate to that action to compensate you"") and nominal damages (which is just almost just a place-holder to show that a wrong has been committed). It is possible that some claims will go forward and some will not, which requires putting a large number together, so that even if 4 claims are not proven, the bad acts of the one claim against the defendants can still fairly compensate them and punish the wrongdoers.",2021-03-28 14:51:20,5

comment,GMU Police Officers Sue GMU for Police Corruption,"**10 Year Anniversary of Wrongdoing** \- Believe it or not, one of the plaintiffs has been fighting a battle to get GMU PD in line for around 10 years. As the complaint explains: >Allegations were made against one of the two Captains, all four Lieutenants, four of the eight Sergeants, and two non-law enforcement employees. As a result of these complaints, an investigative auditor with the GMU began an investigation, in which \[plaintiff 1\] assisted. The auditor’s final report showed wide-spread violations of Virginia policy and law among the senior leadership command at the GMU Police Department. Such violations included the failure to record leave taken and the viewing, sharing, and storage of sexually explicit materials (totaling over 3,000 photographs and 80 messages requesting sexual favors), on state-issued computers while on state time. Additionally, there were confirmed allegations of racist and sexually explicit comments from command staff to other GMU employees, and theft of items in the GMU “lost and found.” As a result of the investigation, approximately seven or eight members of the GMU Police Department left the university. Although no allegations were made against the GMU PD chief at that time, the chief elected to resign from his position as a result of the report. > >After this investigation and exposure of the GMU Police Department, GMU retaliated against \[plaintiff 1\] by refusing to promote him according to his service and experience. Through a hearing before the Office of Employment Dispute Resolution in 2014, it was found that GMU wrongfully failed to promote \[plaintiff 1\] from Sergeant to Lieutenant and wrongfully moved him away from the main GMU campus of Fairfax to the Prince William County satellite campus in retaliation for reporting and participating in the investigator’s 2012 investigation. Though the original hearing decision ordered GMU to promote \[plaintiff 1\] to Lieutenant, an administrative appeal challenged the hearing officer’s authority to provide such relief. An administrative appeal decided on July 24, 2014 changed the order’s decision to the following language: > >For the reasons stated herein, the University is ORDERED: > >1) The University is ordered to create an environment for Grievant that is free from retaliation. This order shall remain in effect as long as Grievant is employed by the University. > >2) The University is ordered to provide Grievant with a remedy that accounts for and corrects its retaliation against him. > >The University took no action pursuant to this revised order. Though an order was sought from the circuit court to enforce the hearing decision, due to the finding of retaliation connected to his failure to be promoted, the circuit court determined the order was too vague to be enforced. As a consequence, GMU did nothing of any substance, and\[plaintiff 1\] remained in the Sergeant position. Though \[plaintiff 1\] was promoted eventually, it was through normal processes and not in relation to his successful grievance. In fact, his grievance was a weight on his professional advancement. Other officers without a history of reporting wrongdoing rose in the ranks of GMU PD faster than \[plaintiff 1\], despite his experience and training.",2021-03-28 14:51:53,0

[...] we must hold a fundamental commitment to ""the principle that debate or deliberation may not be suppressed because the ideas put forth are thought by some or even by most members of the University community to be offensive, unwise, immoral, or wrong-headed."" https://www.gmu.edu/about/integrity-and-standards/free-speech-george-mason",2025-10-08 16:59:01,16
comment,The Sign that opened my eyes!,">Mason finally had enough of all the street preachers coming here over these past few weeks Mason's problem is that it can not suppress them. It is a public institution. The courts have repeatedly told public institutions of higher learning that they can not hide behind ""fostering a learning environment"" or words similar in order to suppress points of view with which much of the institution's community might not agree.",2025-10-09 00:16:44,3

comment,Mason Fucked us All Over Prove Me Wrong,"Tbh I feel like Mason did their best with the cards they were given. I understand that quality of education dropped and prices rose, and trust me I know how annoying the price increases are. It is also extremely frustrating to never receive a break throughout the semester. The lack of reading days is also very stressful. However, this is my hot take. The idea ""Mason fucked us over"" I feel like is pointing a finger at the wrong person/entity. I feel like each decision mason made was educated and calculated, they worked to secure public safety. If me facing extra stress is what comes from it, I cannot fault their decision. Quite honestly I feel like this all happened because there is a systematic problem with how this country, and various others, handled this pandemic. If we want to point fingers then we should look at ourselves and determine how to fight mis-information and determine how to handle these situations better. That's just my take.

comment,Mason Fucked us All Over Prove Me Wrong,"So I personally don't really see how the price increases are fundamentally unethical, as my current understanding and the evidence I have seen suggests that price increases are being invested into administration, facilities, support services. Additionally compared to what the estimate of tuition increase applied to the state it has been reported to be lower than expected. If the price jump was put into Cabrera's pocket then I can see where you're coming from, but I think a lot of students have been asking for better administration, better support services, and better facilities. If you have evidence to show the contrary please let me know. I do know price increases have a historic relation to enforcing systemic racial and class segregation, but GMU's diversity is still well funded and well developed. Additionally, I understand my language may give off the appearance that high prices are minor inconveniences, but to be quite frank I've had to sell my car, I'm busting my ass working part time, and taking out crazy amount of loans to make end meets. But college isn't cheap but I don't wanna work a job that's gonna keep breaking my back.",2021-05-02 07:48:51,-1

post,Please stop complaining about GMU,"Please stop complaining about GMU -*It’s a commuter school* With over 27,000 undergraduate students in a busy suburban area, it’s kind of hard not to be. It’s not a commuter school if you’re a freshman. *It’s easy to get into* An 89% acceptance rate does not guarantee you’ll get in. The average GPA of incoming freshman is over 3.6 *It’s not a good school* World University Rankings ranked Mason 471 out of 20,966, US News ranked them 109 nationally and tied 52 in public universities, WSJ ranked them 33, Forbe’s American Colleges ranked them 40; yes, it’s a good school. *There’s no social life* That is a bit iffy. If you just go for classes then go home/back to your dorm, then obviously, you’re not going to have a social life. If you live on campus or are a commuter that spends most of your time on campus, then it’s easy to find something to do and clubs to join. When I was there 10+ years ago, most of my friends were commuters but were involved in groups. You have to go out and find things to do, very rarely will it come to you (ha, that rhymed). If you’re able to live on campus, I would strongly suggest doing so. I commuted my first two years then lived on campus the other two (I took six years), and it was a world of difference. *There’s no school spirit* That’s mainly true. The most school spirit I saw when I was there was when we went to the final four in basketball. Unfortunately, when most people graduate, that’s the end. Very few people I know go to their reunions. *They need a football team that’s not club* That’s not going to happen anytime soon. I think that’s the most common complaints I’ve seen.

comment,Please stop complaining about GMU,"For real, the college is what you make of it. I’m graduating this year and made a ton of friends, who are all commuters. If you want a social life then you have to learn to be social. I think that’s true for pretty much all colleges. Also gmu provides great education, and is very affordable. Additionally there are plenty of clubs, programs, and after class activities to participate in. Talking to others is an important life skill to have just in general.",2024-11-20 16:36:16,6
comment,Please stop complaining about GMU,"I’ve lived near George Mason my whole life and even though I go to Georgetown, I can confirm George Mason is a good school. People don’t realize how good it is until you travel outside of North Virginia and see colleges like University of New Haven, Radford, ODU or even University of Delaware to some extent. People whine too much and if they want all the extra bells and whistles then they should work harder to go to a higher ranked college. At George Mason, I think you are getting pretty good value relative to the price tag…you are getting exactly what you paid for.",2024-11-21 19:24:28,5

comment,Please stop complaining about GMU,"something people seem to miss regardless of age, is the school, like any other opportunity is entirely what you make it. it's a lot easier to complain and find blame after the fact than constantly make yourself available to take advantage of opportunities. most people don't know how to seize the moment and get distracted. putting down the school is just a way to cope. sometimes i hear complaints like these from former students and i think ""yes, the school that's had decades of proud, successful alumni didn't work for you, so it must be a problem with the school!""",2024-11-21 02:47:40,3

comment,Please stop complaining about GMU,"I went to GMU 20 years ago, and what you wrote (and what many people have said in the replies) could be said then as well. That said, I really enjoyed it there and had no regrets! I had friends at ""party"" schools like WVU and I'm from Charlottesville so I've spent a lot of my life living in UVA's backyard, and I spent time with friends at other schools in the District proper. Sure, the social stuff is different, but it didn't make me dislike Mason. I still had a big group of friends on and off campus, we still went out, and we still had a lot of fun! I was there during the 2006 Final Four run too, *that* was fun. Admittedly, it gave me something to brag to my friends at the ""fun"" schools with the better known sports teams too 😅",2024-11-24 12:01:15,3
comment,Please stop complaining about GMU,"I love this thank you. I feel grateful to be here even though I am guilty of complaining. I had health problems that made me drop out of high school despite skipping two grades in math when I was young. I felt defeated once I was 20 and the people on my level in middle school were graduating from prestigious universities while I had finally gotten into a place where I could start community college. I have to pay my tuition myself, out of pocket to avoid debt. I had a full time job the first semester at Mason and it was quite difficult in a STEM major. I feel like I’m missing out on a traditional college experience, but I have to give myself grace when I know hardly anyone had to put up with the things I had to put up with in middle/high school.

With an acceptance rate of nearly 100%, the school is overcrowded, and there seems to be little to no standard for admitting students or hiring professors. Many of these professors have terrible ratings on Rate My Professors. For this reason alone, the school’s ratings are almost guaranteed to decline over time.

comment,Please stop complaining about GMU,I've been one of they few people defending this school for the past 5 years. It's the only university I ever applied to.

When in reality all those things will still be available to you after college.,2024-11-22 17:57:17,1
comment,Please stop complaining about GMU,"The professors are underpaid, the staff works under heavy stress, the students can’t get help right away. The bureaucracy in Mason is so bad, you trynna get some simple things done here you will have to talk to 3 different departments until you can finally talk to someone that’s able to help you. It’s the fact I go to this school and realize how bad it is. I think the social life aspect is completely up to each person, so that’s not a Mason problem. But this school don’t have a supportive system that help their students, the students have to go look for help themselves and they often don’t get what they needed. This school won’t listen to the people that works there, or goes there. Nobody takes pride going to this school and I think that just speaks volumes about how they all feel. I paid to go to this school and I did not receive any form of assistance but rather headaches; I became a better person by overcoming the bullshit GMU put me through instead of what they trynna “teach” me in school. Of course I have the right to say this school fucking sucks.",2024-11-20 12:47:45,1

comment,Please stop complaining about GMU,"Honestly the best part in my opinion about GMU is how it’s in such a densely populated area with a lot of government contract work. I’ve talked to people who went to Tech, UVA, or JMU. They had a much harder time finding internships and jobs right out of college since they had little to no real job experience. Here you can easily get a summer job, and if you can’t, you can get a job during the school year since all the people living in nova went down to their jmu, uva, tech schools (granted some people don’t work during school). GMU lends you a ton of opportunities and I think that’s honestly its strongest point if you aren’t looking for big social life. I stopped working part time as a waiter after my sophomore year and went from internship to internship which paid more than waiting tables, was relevant to my job field, and gave me a job after college.",2024-11-20 10:38:41,41

comment,Hope the admins see this and realized they are clowns,"The only issue is they aren’t listing all tests yet, only a portion of the Kallaco tests.

comment,Hope the admins see this and realized they are clowns,"For the sake of your argument, let's say that the President is telling the dean to disseminate false information. Option 1) Dean says no, shares accurate scientific analysis - leaders are mad, but dean has respect of scientific community and can easily get another high-ranking job. Option 2) Dean goes with the flow, intentionally shares incorrect scientific information with the community - loses respect/confidence of entire science community, no one will ever work with him or publish him again. Lose his position with National Center for Biodefense and Infectious Diseases. Lose his position with Virginia Drug Discovery Consortium. Lose his position with Virginia Catalyst.

I dropped out of university and eventually went to community college before transferring here. I am a commuter, but Mason became an escape from my life and a vibrant place where I felt like I could totally be myself; amidst the cold winters and the beckoning springs.

I got involved with LSA (latin student association) and the French Club and went to their general body meetings. I also signed up for the intramural sports leagues; that was great! Those were the highlights, I didn’t do much else (I considered doing the international buddy program), because I wanted that good balance and had commitments back home anyway. But it was great.

Canvas is the digital version of a square classroom with a professor's desk, student desks, a whiteboard, a projector, and a podium with a gradebook inside. If the professor doesn't want to learn how to use it as-is, or thinks it's not good enough for their ""teaching style,"" what they can do is quit their job.",2021-02-13 18:12:01,2

I’m not sure too many students know, but it’s the largest telescope in VA. If you’re interested in visiting our observatory, tours are regularly held and open to everyone on Wednesday, Thursday, and Saturday evenings (as well as completely free to attend.) During each tour, you’ll get to look through its eyepiece, visit the control room, stargaze, and learn about the facility. For fun, there’s some of our best astrophotography we’ve taken with it so far.🪐 We’ve got some big events planned for the upcoming Solar Eclipse this month!☀️ Feel free to AMA about it, I work as a tour guide there👍🔭",2023-10-05 02:43:26,262

comment,The rebranding is insane. Why were students not consulted about it?,There is no possible way the spent 10 million on a new logo design. Even $500k seems outlandish.

comment,The rebranding is insane. Why were students not consulted about it?,"You're missing the entire point. They're rebranding the entire school. In their [blog post](https://www.gmu.edu/news/2024-04/george-mason-university-completes-long-term-rebrand-new-logo), they stated that they'll be moving away from ""Mason"" and ""GMU"", despite those being the two most common names for this school. If you look at this subreddit name, there's a reason it's named GMU, not George Mason....because we know this school as Mason/GMU. As pointed out by u/jayebird1012, this just further demonstrates the school administration's disconnect from our wants, because this rename is 100% not what we wanted. Also, let's not get into the fact that GM overlaps with General Motors. That by itself should be a reason not to change to this new logo.",2024-04-25 16:52:22,20

So maybe hasn't learned to be super stealth yet. Another disease that's more common than rabies in these guys (in this area at least) is mange. Mange can make them appear less fearful of humans because it affects their ability to hunt and starving animals get desperate. Thankfully, this little dude has a nice coat, so I doubt it's mangy.

comment,What the actual fuck,"I'm not going to a school with this. There are plenty of universities who enforce no-touch policies (prevents the tapping on the shoulder or approach) and content-neutral restrictions which disallow ALL megaphones, gory images and other rallying in designated areas within certain feet of classroom buildings. What students should do: 1. REPORT any physical contact. Even just tapping on the shoulder. I know its a joke out there about assault, but assault is ANY unwanted touching, even if its just a pat on the back. Following counts under other laws and should also be reported. 2. Contact your admin to see permits or request info on amplified noise protocols. 3. if this truly is distracting or causing issues, report it. If enough students do, they won't kick groups like this off campus but they will tighten the rules around it which is better for everyone, regardless of group.

comment,THIS IS AN MLM SCAM. This “company” is a part of Vector Marketing. They target students who are in need of money and bring them in to sell overpriced knife sets to their friends and family.,"Worked for CutCo. Vector Marketing not long ago. Decent knives and halfway decent benefits. I enjoyed doing the presentations but they were far and few between. You are tasked with setting up your own appointments by building connections with those who you do presentations for. Majority of the time they didn’t want to give out names and numbers of other people (understandably). Which left you with a dead end, which stung even more when they didn’t buy anything. You also do not get paid mileage for the distances you drive, which left me paying for over 100$ in gas which was a little under. 1/3 of my pay check. Remember those benefits I talked about? I bought a set of knives with the block for a little under 700$ because the Regional Manager liked me and gave me a discount. That was about it. Yes it is a scam, and yes it’s a poor job for a High School student. Rant over.",2019-05-15 01:13:30,2

comment,GMU students right now,"Many countries around the world recommend NOT using masks. Because, while there's no proof that masks don't work there's no proof that masks work either. There's proof that masks work in a controlled environment, but there's no evidence outside of that. There's several issues and benefits to masks, and there's no study accurately and empirically proving their effectiveness: 1) Masks cause more people to touch their face, they then get the virus on their hands and proceed to touch other objects 2) Masks provide SOME protection against droplets and virions entering the air, meaning they're effective if the people with the virus follow proper precautions (huge if) 3) Masks make people bold, working against social distancing 4) Masks make it harder to talk loud, so people need to get closer to communicate, also working against social distancing. All the ""evidence"" you hear about on news are highly politicized messages, where the ""evidence"" is either gathered in a controlled environment, or it's a mathematical prediciton model (which has proven wrong on every turn this pandemic) I just hate how the journalists are incompitent enough to fail to question all the governments bullshitting. Not just when it comes to masks, but everything in general. Long story short, don't think yourself all so wise by using masks. I use them myself due to government regulations, but I'm very sceptical about them actually achieving anything. You could be right or you could be wrong, so stop victimizing yourself and calling out everyone who disagrees with you. Your opinion is perfectly valid, I'm not saying that it isn't, but you should have some scepticism. Why is it that you hate how the American government has handled this pandemic, yet you blindly trust them that masks work, when it runs contrary to the common consensus in Europe? Edit: If any of you downvoting lurkers out there disagree, at least participate by referencing a study. Downvoting me doesn't prove me wrong. I'm willing to admit to being wrong if you can find some good studies proving me wrong, I don't stubbornly stick to opinions for no good reason. (Preferrably a study that isn't funded by someone with a bias) There're first-world countries that don't recommend masks, ie. the scandinavian countries, they do this for a reason. I'm not saying that masks don't help, but that there's a lack of undisputable evidence that they do. There's nobody that's properly informed on the issue that disagree with that. Here's a pretty decent article on it, albeit a little out-dated: https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.bbc.com/news/amp/world-52015486",2020-07-02 19:32:04,-9

comment,"Mason keeps misleading and endangering us, here's some fast facts:","They could, that’s why it’s really up to lawyers and judges. Contact tracing should be able to identify, to some extent, where and when the person was exposed (especially now with the new VA COVID tracing app). With Kallaco tests (which they’ve now run out of) the results aren’t reported to VDH. According to a former VDH case investigator who spoke to a partner at another college, VDH only accepts results for FDA approved nasopharyngeal swan tests - so VDH doesn’t accept Kallaco test results. VDH can’t contact trace cases who aren’t reported to them - so any positive Kallaco tests wouldn’t be traced in the first place. Essentially it’d be hard to prove exposure on campus unless you received an approved test and were properly contact traced. So technically the positives reported through Kallaco testing never even were true positives in the eye of the state.",2020-08-30 15:34:17,2
comment,"Mason keeps misleading and endangering us, here's some fast facts:","One of the quirks of business law is that business registrations are for the registered agent - who by law typically only has to accept legal service. So registered office typically /= actual office. Some states (ahem LA and DE) also make it difficult by not showing members of a company. One case is my company: I’m the registered agent and the registered office is my house, but the business office is another member’s house, meanwhile (bc it’s Texas) all members are listed publicly. It definitely would be interesting to see who the members of the LLC are, but the way DE works the only way we’d possibly know is through an investigation by the state. Two newer things that might get their own post: Kallaco’s Chief Science Advisor (preciously Chief Science Officer) is the CSO for Opteo - this breaks down further the idea that Opteo is third party. Kallaco is also violating Virginia law. Their HIPPA privacy office is in Glen Allen, which is considered transacting business in the state, and the law requires registration with the VA SCC before transacting business - but they’re not registered.",2020-08-31 19:25:03,2
comment,"Mason keeps misleading and endangering us, here's some fast facts:","i suggest looking even more closely at VCU. From the documents released in the William and Mary story, it's clear that William and Mary had planned to contract out testing to VCUHS, then VCU said it could not provide it but had a brand new contractor to offer. I believe the contracting order goes VCU, then W&M, then GMU. Each gets a Sole Source contract one day before they put in a request for sole source authorization. It seems plausible that both W&M and GMU were relying on representations made by VCU. President Rao's statements also make it very unclear how much distance there is between Kallaco and VCUHS.

There probably weren't that many entities that could fulfill the order in a specific time frame and price point. Due diligence should have be done to check into the company.

comment,"Mason keeps misleading and endangering us, here's some fast facts:","In March, state agencies were authorized to bypass the standard procurement process after the Governor’s emergency declaration - but still had to seek competition to the max extent practicable. According to the emails sent out by Mason, no other company could do it at the price and speed. In the FFX Times article (linked on our twitter @oversightgmu) it was said that Kallaco was $200-300k cheaper than One Medical. A severe underbid like that should raise immediate questions - the base value of the contract being $156k and an additional potential value of $490k (for a total of nearly $650k), a price difference of half the total potential value should raise questions. Also LabCorp holds a mandatory source contract for lab services with the state (why student health uses them) dating to 2017, COVID testing was added in May to the contract (but in theory it’s not mandatory since procurement procedures were lifted). LabCorp’s price is $51 per test - compared to the base cost for Kallaco of $79. Added costs include shipping and physician review for $16 bringing it to $95 with Kallaco, let’s assume similar making LabCorp $67 - this makes LabCorp cheaper by $126k on tests alone. They also say companies couldn’t test at the same level as Kallaco, but LabCorp specifically offers testing for universities and has a capacity of 130k tests per day - we only needed 4500 total",2020-08-30 12:08:57,5

It's worth taking a risk. Not taking risks won't get you anywhere and this applies to any situation (ex: applying to grad school or job, exercise, traveling, etc.).

comment,"IF YOU LIKE SOMEONE, TALK TO THEM","This post appears way too on time ha so let me vent my story out. I transferred to Mason two years ago. There's this class I had to take and it's either with a notorious professor or a very nice prof (her class was actually marked ""recommended to transfer"" I believe). The problem is, of course her section was full. So I waitlisted and came to her class. For some reason it was not as exciting as I thought, so I thought about dropping out and just enrolled for sure in the other prof's class. Then came a boy, walking straight to the first row of the lecture hall (I was in the second row, cant concentrate if I sit in the back). Of course I noticed him, the only one in the first row middle of the class (so right in front of the professor essentially). He was ... interesting I guess. Very attentive tho, answered all the prof's questions with quite an interesting accent. Immediately I took a liking to that. Luckily, the waitlist opened to me (I was the third in the queue so thank whoever not accepting that). I sat behind him all semesters, looking forward to the class so that I could see him. One time I had a reason to ask him a question and that literally drained out all of my courage and energy. I had no friend at Mason at that point, so I was just so happy. But then the semester went on and I went back to not daring to talk to him. Then I found a friend, who later knew about my silly crush and kept pushing me to talking to him. I of course had no ball to do so. Then came the very last day of the semester. My friend, who at this point was so fed up with my inaction, literally pushed me to talk to him and yeah, I did, asked his discord. I remembered getting out of the class and literally jumping and running. We then hang out for one time. Next semester, I found out he's taking another section same as me. Of course I was happy. We talked, but inside class only. Got him into the same group for the group project and found out he was actually pretty funny. Then before my third sem, he actually showed me his schedule and asked if we're in any class together. Sadly, I registered terribly late and did not get into any section with him. Well, somehow his section got cancelled and he transferred to, guess what, my section. Got into the same group project again. I then started to talk to him outside class. It was not easy tho. He wasn't very talkative and on top of that we just had different interest. This sem, my friend, the one who pushed me to talk to him, once again helped me and we now ended up in the same friend group that hang out more often. I am now very happy that he opens up to me way more than before. And we're good friend now. I wish I can say we are more than that. Well, the reason I hesitated talking to him was because I am gei and he's not. So yeah, in the beginning I just felt like there is no point. Lately it's starting to hit me that I'll probably not see this boy again after graduation and every now and then I will just feel extremely sad about it. I am still grateful that I talked to him first. He will a good memory of my college time here. Sometimes I wish he know about my feeling, I don't even need any reciprocal feeling, just wants him to know I have a silly one-and-a-half-year long crush on him. At the same time, the last thing I want is to destroy what we have currently. But yeah, happy to know him. If you reach this point, well thank you for reading. If you feel the story is somewhat familiar, please say nothing to anyone ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|grimacing)",2025-04-05 20:41:51,4

She doesn't have a physical body to have sex with, but if the implied fantasy here is lusting after a sexually inexperienced Tilly Norwood, is it that she's programed that way, and could someone not just generate an OF for her or VR porn? Would that person then still see her as a virgin? would they just ""wipe her memory"" or deprogram or replay whatever to recreate that first time experience again?

comment,Police Raid Mason Students’ Home,"IN THE EARLY morning hours of November 7, more than 12 police officers showed up outside at an address in Springfield, Virginia, knocked, broke down the door, and raided the family home of two Palestinian American students at George Mason University. University and Fairfax County police refused to show the family the warrant. One Fairfax County detective with the FBI’s Joint Terrorism Task Force — cross-designated as a local and federal agent — was also present. The family and Mason faculty supporting them, however, believe they know what the FBI-led investigation was about: the young family members’ pro-Palestine activism.",2024-12-04 01:33:19,55

post,ReplyAllGate,"ReplyAllGate Good Morning Glorious GMU Students (sadly this list is less than 35,000). So, on Wednesday on my way to Fairfax for my 7:10 class, I checked google maps to see how bad traffic is and if I need to use a different road to get into campus. On this particular day, traffic was the worst I had seen. The campus being at a standstill was a given, but all the roads outside of mason were also backed up, some of them for about a mile (worst I had seen). Once I got on campus and finally parked, all the way in the back, I get out of my car and hoof and poof all the way to class. Later I get an email saying their professors will contact students about missing class, because of a power outage. I was tired and miss the ""Because of a power outage part of this email"". You know, all good, no biggy. So at this point, I am thinking to myself, ""traffic caused students to be late/miss their class, wow, that's not cool"". So I decided, Mason needs to know my thoughts and feelings on this matter, because you know, I'm so important. I send them an email saying, ""not cool mason...."". Come Friday morning I receive an email: >Your message dated Thu, 8 Nov 2018 17:22:12 +0000 with subject ""Re: > >University Registrar: Class Adjustments due to Power Outage"" has been successfully distributed to the GMU-STUDENT- USA-L list (38114 recipients). followed by: >Yo I dont know you but you might have sent an email to a bunch of people by replying to the school wide email lmao And so, my weekend has been the best weekend ever. First, I want to thank the academy, this would not have been possible without you. Secondly, I would like thanks everyone making memes, your time and effort are appreciated, and worth it. lastly, I would like to thank the absence of blind carbon copy (BCC). At this point in my career, I think it is best I retire while I am at the top. Thank you meme'ers!! Below, I would like to post some of the best reply's I have received. (half of these people replied all back. lol) >Lol you just replied all to like... the entire University. > >Gg bro. &#x200B; >Lol dude your message sent to all GMU, pull back! > >Best Regards, > >Fellow GMU Student >go off queen &#x200B; >Hi, this is \*\*\*\*\* \*\*\*. > >I am so confused what is this email for. Is it really meant to be sending to me? > >I cannot understand why this has came to me. At least can you tell me what happened? > >Moreover, i cannot see the all the words of the email in some reasons. It just don't show up to me right now. I don't feel good hearing that you are doing something more work. Can you please be more accurate? > >Thank you. And i hope you have good days. >In other news, 35,000 students discovered you can reply to everybody. >Dear “Aatanas2”, > >I agree that it is a bust to have to afford extra time to a class that was cancelled due to a situation outside of our control. The saying, “an issue on your end does not constitute an emergency on my end,” resounds with me on this. However, this is life. Unforeseen occurrences befall people every day, and we adjust to the circumstance. If humans did not adjust to inconvenient circumstances, we probably would have gone extinct long ago. The caveman, although he was tired, did not tell the sabre-tooth tiger to come again after his nap. Rather he found the gumption to get up and run, or defend himself. Once, you graduate, you will run into this situation numerous times- guaranteed. The people that give up or complain, never seem to see the next promotion or raise. Rather the people that can deal with this type of situation find themselves in rewarding situations. > >I hope this short paragraph helps you deal with this hard time as it has helped me in the past. Also proof your message before you send it out to the entire school. Another suggestion would be: hit “reply” and not “reply all”- big difference. Take care and best of luck with the rest of your semester. > >Sincerely, > >\*. \*\*\*\*\*\* >Yeah, that's life... &#x200B; >You do understand that you replied to a service that won’t look at it and you replied to the entire body that got that original email.

Preach 🙌 &#x200B; > You realize you sent this to the entire school including the graduate students right ?

I apologize that your response was mistakenly sent to all students. We always appreciate hearing concerns and the compliments, and I thank you for taking the time to respond. > >With best regards and wishes for a productive conclusion to your semester, > >\*\*\*\*\* (yah. my bad) &#x200B; >Keep it up girl, voice your concerns (thanks bro, I'm a bro ;) ) >hi >you hit reply all lol &#x200B; >That’s not cool….

Let me share some tips with you. > >First, whenever you send a reply, look to see who is in the recipient field. By now, I'm sure you realize your reply was sent to the entire student body and contained multiple grammatical errors. Let this be a lesson learned for when you get into the workforce. Unlike college where something like this has no ramifications, mistakes like this can get you fired. > >Second, life isn't always fair. Sometimes things like power outages happen, but that doesn't always mean you get a free pass. Again, going back to whenever you enter the workforce, work doesn't necessarily stop just because the power goes out. You find ways to make it work. The university left the decision up to the individual professor to assign makeup work. I'm sure it's safe to say your probability of your own professor now assigning you extra work just got a lot higher. > >Lastly, we live in time when fake news and evidence-based arguments often clash. I'm not entirely sure what your statement about Eagle Bank Arena is all about. Assumingly, it's in regards to paying for it. Eagle Bank Arena has been in existence for many years and was formerly The Patriot Center. Over the years, funding for higher education from the state has significantly decreased. The naming rights to the Patriot Center was sold to Eagle Bank for $6.6 million for 10 years with an option for an additional 10 years for a total of $13.7 million for the entire 20-year period. If it had not been for this, that $6.6 million would have been generated from tuition and fees. Bottom line, don't just through random statements out there without 1) clarity and 2) evidence to back up your claim. > >In closing, I don't know if you intended to email everyone and what kind of response you have gotten, but I would be remiss if I didn't use this as a teachable moment. I remember what it was like as an undergrad, and I wish I had someone here to help me through some of my mistakes back then. That's why I'm reaching out to you. Best of luck with the rest of the semester. &#x200B; >Congratulations guy.

post,"If you or a loved one has been victimized by IT 207 Hoda Hassan, See Below","If you or a loved one has been victimized by IT 207 Hoda Hassan, See Below Greetings all, If you are in GMU IT 207, you might have received an Honor Code Violation email last morning. You, and many others, are very confused. After a peer of yours sifted through the data of their own violation claims - the following was found: 1.) The professor omitted critical information in the assignment instructions when giving their forms to the Academic Office of Integrity. The critical information omitted, was the code that she gave us to complete the assignment. 75% of the code to complete the assignment, was given to us by the course co-ordinator, given the claims are AI-related Plaigiarism most of us are confused on how this claim could arise when the course-coordinator provided us the majority of materials to complete this assignment in writing. Furthermore, we are confused as to why she would omit such details.2.) Upon review of the assignment, the remaining 20% (this totals to 20 lines of code, give or take) was our job. This does not aid in beating the allegations of AI utilization, however it is of probable cause that ""the fucking intro students can handle 20 lines of code without resorting to AI"" - I digress. 3.) The Course-Co-ordinator herself, labeled the specific instances of reasons to suspect AI have a theme revolving around ""using advanced techniques not taught in the class"". Our findings point to every single ""Advanced technique"" used, being taught in IT 106. Which is a pre-requisite course. Every advanced technique referenced, is actually a basic technique. For example, the use of a Try/Catch block is considered advanced when it is taught in a pre-requisite course as a basic technique. Why can't the co-ordinator tell the difference? Unsure. 4.) Not only was the claim based on her not knowing the difference between advanced and basic techniques, but her supporting evidence is simply her throwing the lab assignment through AI - and the output that is there, literally is code completely different from the assignment and anyone else's own code. Remember, she gave us 75% of the code. That means when given the instructions from the lab, AI will change 75% of the code. Given that most people's code, looks like the code given to us by the instructor, the AI Input-Output screenshots show that she not only fails to read students' assignments, but also her own documentation in regards to accusing students of cheating. 5.) Evidence of one student conversing with Hoda Hassan is present, where they had an honor violation in progress, met with Hoda, and had it dismissed.

comment,As an immunocompromised cancer patient trying to finish school if you are not vaccinated and dont mask you can fuck right off.,"This isn't accurate. Can vaccinated people (IF they catch covid) spread the latest strain (Omicron) as easily as unvaccinated people? Yes for the most part this seems true. (Although this wasn't true with prior strains were being vaccinated made it less likely they would be able to spread it). **HOWEVER...** being vaccinated DOES limit the potential for someone to GET covid in the 1st place. Therefore it makes it less likely to spread Covid through that mechanic. It ALSO limits the severity of the infection which limits the potential severity of the spread. So while someone vaccinated might get Omicron and be just as able to spread it should that occur, they are LESS likely to get covid in the 1st place which makes a vaccinated person actually LESS likely to spread covid (if they don't get it), and less likely to spread as significant a viral load to boot.",2022-01-30 11:35:24,6

comment,As an immunocompromised cancer patient trying to finish school if you are not vaccinated and dont mask you can fuck right off.,"> You do realise that vaccinated people still contract and transmit covid right...? Of course they can. I even acknowledge that in another comment in this post. However the chance of a vaccinated person getting covid in the 1st place is lower, even if we account in the Omicron strain, and as such, vaccination limits the potential for someone to spread covid by simply limiting the potential for them to GET covid (along with limiting the viral load they carry). Obviously, vaccination goes hand in hand with masking and other safety measures. But I guarantee that because of this new policy, people are not even going to mask as much and it's going to snowball into certain segments of the population just not giving a fuck about others. It was already happening even WITH the policies in place. You don't think it's going to just get worse now?",2022-01-30 16:35:48,-1

Got hired, learned a lot within those first 2 years, and was recruited by my current employer. Honestly, you’ll probably find an entry level job, learn the shit side of the trade, but also learn about where you want to grow professionally, and then make career moves to achieving that.

These are just meant to compliment how you dress and look. My personal dailys are Afnan Supremacy Noir and Lapidus Black extreme.

It feels like every class wastes a huge chunk of time trying to wait for folks to sort out issues or attempting to work through issues to progress forward. But yea phone distraction is real for many lol. You can just see folks eyes drifting lol.",2020-09-15 11:39:47,4

After a week of waiting, I now have it approved and listed on the [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/stopaskinggmu/) and [Edge](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/stopaskinggmu/memjepmledaojhndmlkcjopkikmlokpb) stores. If you want to look at the code (I promise I'm not stealing your data lol) or install it in another browser like Chrome, you can check out [the GitHub page](https://github.com/KellanClark/stopaskinggmu/tree/main).",2025-09-19 20:40:52,211

post,"Meredith Ashley Drottar (‘10), 03/04/1988-01/15/2025","Meredith Ashley Drottar (‘10), 03/04/1988-01/15/2025 It is with deep sorrow that we announce that our beloved partner, sister, aunt, friend, and Phan, Meredith Ashley “Doc Otter” Drottar stepped through the portal at 6:02 pm January 15 at St. Mary’s Hosptial in Grand Junction. Meredith is survived by her father Tim Scally, her sister Meghan Thompson, her partner Timothy “Pepe” Edington, her nieces Cheyanne, Cassadey, and Anna, her nephews Simon and Codah, and her beloved dogs Bodhidharma (Bodhi) and the Lumpy Space Duchess (Ducky). She was preceded in death by her mother Debbie (46) and sister Morgan Jenner (43). Meredith lived a life out of movie and it started when she was born at home on March 4, 1988 in Leesburg, VA. Her adventure really ramped up 5 days laters when the family packed up and moved cross country to Fort Collins, CO. Meredith would spend her entire childhood in Fort Collins and would go on to graduate from Rocky Mountain High School. Despite working and helping her sisters with their children, she found the time to volunteer as a peer to peer crisis counselor. This would be the start of an adult life spent helping others. She would overcome a difficult childhood that saw her lose her mother at 14 and become the first person in her family to attend college. She attended George Mason University where she earned a bachelor’s degree in social work. While at George Mason Meredith began working at Trader Joe’s. She worked for 15 years at Trader Joe’s in stores from Reston, VA to Denver, CO with stops in Albuquerque and Salt Lake City in between, leaving a litany of lasting lifelong friendships. While living in Albuquerque, she met Timothy, a crusty, 1.0 veteran, who would become her companion and partner for the rest of her life. She would later attend Capella University where she earned a Master’s degree in counseling. After two years of clinical work, she would go on to open her own counseling practice, Yellow Sky Counseling. Meredith’s life was dedicated to helping others and this was reflected in her choice to be a therapist and the passion she put into it. Meredith was passionate about many issues and causes, including smashing the patriarchy, reproductive rights, and gay and trans rights. Meredith loved music and going to concerts, particularly Phish and Dead and Company, and recently started playing the ukulele. Other hobbies and passions included hiking, whitewater rafting, creating art, writing, reading as many books as she could get her hands on, and spending Saturday night by a fire listening to crunchy jams with Timothy and her dogs. In the last few years, Meredith's life seemed to reach new heights. Her counseling practice was flourishing and she purchased her first house in Cortez, CO. Meredith attended her first Phish concert on September 5, 2021. On the way into the venue Meredith ate a Chomp meat stick. Well, wouldn’t you know it, that night the band came out of Catapult and launched into Meatstick, and despite it being her first show, she did the dance perfectly. She attended her final show on August 29, 2024. She had planned to attend the entire Dick’s run, but sadly tragedy struck and her sister Morgan passed away in a motorcycle accident the next day and she missed the last 3 shows. In between her first show and last Meredith saw 14 shows and enjoyed every single one. She almost got to do it all, Dick’s, a festival, and going on tour. She was planning on attending her first YEMSG and New Year’s Eve shows this coming December. Meredith never really had a crew, just her partner and Light Buddy, Timothy, with whom she attended all her shows. Her favorite jams included Carini, Fluffhead, Harry Hood, Say It To Me S.A.N.T.O.S., and Sand. The two songs Meredith was chasing at the time of her passing were Lengthwise and Makisupa Policeman. A private service for family will be held on January 23 at Goes Funeral Home in Fort Collins, CO and will be followed by a public viewing. A Celebration of Life open to the public will be held January 25 at a location to be determined. The family asks that in lieu of flowers, donations be made to either the Mariposa Fund, the Trevor Project, and/or the Divided Sky Foundation.",2025-01-18 20:59:49,210

comment,"So, it’s one of THOSE days.",Abortion only became murder to evangelicals in the late 1970s and early 1980s with Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell realizing it was a way to galvanize an alliance with Catholics to form the religious right and expand their influence culminating in the election of Ronald Reagan. Abortion for the vast majority of the world and people is not murder and Roe v Wade had a good distinction of the point of fetal viability being the right point for when restrictions could take effect. If you believe Abortion is murder that's fine but don't enforce what you and your beliefs on the rest of society.,2022-10-24 15:23:38,11

comment,Sign the Petition To Make GMU Fall 2020 Classes Pass/Fail An Option Due to COVID-19,"I posted about it in another thread but folks do need to think about a few things before making a choice to support or not support pass/fail. 1. Pass/Fail is literally impossible for some classes. They simply cant because it requires a certain grade to proceed on the educational path. So even with pass/fail you may not have it as an option. 2. Pass/Fail can SCREW YOU OVER down the line when it comes to continuing education or certain degree requirements. You may have to RE-TAKE courses to get letter grades, meaning you are spending more money, and more time, then perhaps you expected all because you took a pass/fail option. 3. Pass/Fail doesnt look good on a transcript and while it's likely not to make a giant difference, it will factor in to anything that would involve a review of your college transcript. I think it's unlikely they will do Pass/Fail since we knew coming into fall things would be online, even with the added stress of COVID and a crazy 2020. But I COMPLETELY understand why some feel as if they want it. Its a no win situation for some students and that sucks.",2020-10-19 22:26:35,8

comment,Sign the Petition To Make GMU Fall 2020 Classes Pass/Fail An Option Due to COVID-19,"Your advisor is wrong then. We went through this same thing in spring. Certain classes require a certain grade or percentage threshold to move onto the next class. How would that possibly function in a pass/fail system? This is a good readup: https://www.uopeople.edu/blog/do-pass-fail-classes-affect-your-gpa/ But also keep in mind they only offer Pass/Fail to undergraduates for a reason. And they have a disclaimer for a reason as well: >What about major courses and professional programs that require a certain grade? >Students are encouraged to consult with their academic advisors or program coordinators before making a decision about converting course grades to the pass/fail grading system. Academic advisors should discuss with students any accreditation standards or other programmatic requirements related to students’ academic performance in courses in the major. However, the decision to select the pass/fail grading option and any responsibility associated with that decision reside with the student I am not saying everyone will be affected, but there clearly is the potential to have to retake a course (unless the school jumps the gun and doesnt offer that particular course as pass/fail to begin with).",2020-10-20 11:01:56,2

I took that as a sign & didn’t choose a new 5th. Since posting this I’ve changed my consideration to auditing so I can get some of the basic stuff.

post,Apparently I Didn’t Graduate,"Apparently I Didn’t Graduate I am so upset and frustrated with George Mason because apparently I never graduated? Earlier in May I walked the stage and celebrated with my family as a first generation graduate. I had submitted for my graduation in the winter semester and was pre approved. I met with someone from my advising office and everything looked good! I got all the emails from tassel and the university congratulating me on graduating! Well two days ago I started the paperwork with my company to apply to grad school. I was looking for an email about why my degree was taking so long and I got one from the Registrars office instead claiming that “There is an issue with your graduation status due to four missing credits”. Why was this never communicated to be BEFORE I walked the stage? I of course called everyone and emailed my advisor asking for help and answers. And none of them understand why I never got an email explaining I wasn’t eligible. They even checked themselves and did not see an email from the Degree Compliance office telling me I was missing the credits. I was missing four elective credits and now I’m registering for a quick summer courses, but what the hell?? I’m not upset that I am technically not a graduate, in my eyes I am. I’ve worked hard throughout college and got to walk the stage and celebrate with my loved ones. I’m just so upset that GMU did this to me and failed me. Why was I approved? Why did they tell me I had all I needed when I didn’t? Why did they only notify me on an email a MONTH after I walked? They couldn’t have called, sent a letter, or emailed my personal one? I wasn’t checking my email anymore I thought I was free of this place 😭 Moral of the story: If you plan on coming to GMU get ready for four years of non communication on every level💚💛 Update: I do know I am at fault here guys, I’m sorta an idiot and didn’t realize I was short the four credits since it looked like everything was checked off on degree works. HOWEVER, others received the notifications that they were ineligible for graduation and that is where my frustration lies (because i never got one🙃). BUT on the bright side I’m registered for some fun easy summer classes and hey—if I get two more A’s I’m graduating cum laude 🤷🏻‍♀️! All is good and always positive! Thanks for all the advice and stuff :)",2025-06-27 12:24:29,207

comment,Apparently I Didn’t Graduate,You probably missed it. gmu will let you graduate “walk” when you are close to finishing the requirements. “Walking” doesn’t necessarily mean you completed the requirements. Didn’t you check your unofficial transcript? It tells you how many earned credits you have. That should have been the first thing you’ve looked at. But - I wont stress much about it. 4 credits is literally one class,2025-06-27 16:41:43,9
comment,Apparently I Didn’t Graduate,"OP, my biggest advice to you and any other GMU student is ALWAYS check DegreeWorks. That’s the only way you’ll ever find out if you’re missing any credits. I remember in my last semester when I was missing a 3 credit class that should’ve already been fulfilled and I contacted my advisor about it. I made my advisor check through the system and she told me DegreeWorks didn’t populate correctly. Even though I already took the class to fulfill that 3 credit requirement. This might’ve been because I switched majors and DegreeWorks probably didn’t understand that 2 different classes could fulfill the same credit requirement. My advisor knew this and took action only because I informed her about it ahead of time. If I hadn’t done all this then I probably might’ve ended up in the same situation as you. But honestly though, I’m really sorry you had to go through all that. No graduate should ever have to go what you did. At the end of the day it’s their fault and not yours.",2025-06-27 15:34:04,11

comment,Apparently I Didn’t Graduate,Did you reconcile your classes with the plan of study courses in degree works? Did you transfer in any credits that didn’t get applied?

comment,Apparently I Didn’t Graduate,"At the end of the day it's our own responsibility as students to make sure we meet the degree requirements. It's not great to have an advisor misguide students but that happens constantly. We need to make sure we have our own stuff figured out and trust no one.

At the same time, its also true for advisors to do everything they can to ensure students succeed since that’s their job that they’re literally getting paid for. Students shouldn’t have to do the work that advisors literally get paid to do.",2025-06-27 21:37:10,3

post,Cheating culture,Cheating culture I hate it. I hate when people casually mention they do cheat. The worst part is they don’t cheat to only pass. They cheat to get the top of the class and wreck the curve. I don’t cheat cause I’m personally horrified of violating academic integrity + fear graduating as a total idiot. I should not be punished for that. Tempted to snitch so bad rn but I have no proof besides them telling me. Edit: cheating to be top of curved graded class means it will be harder for everyone else to get a good grade because that’s how curved classes work. Seriously look it up before telling me to just work harder.,2025-02-28 01:45:29,206
comment,Cheating culture,i’ve never met anyone who cheated for any other reason than to pass. i even edited an article on how cheating is more common in stem majors because the rigorous courseload and high demands drive them to cheat to try and keep from failing,2025-02-28 02:23:36,194
comment,Cheating culture,"The only solution is to just focus on your own studies and score higher. There’s always going to be a cheater but they aren’t directly hindering you from achieving the same grade legitimately. If it’s homework, pre-lab, online quiz expect to get a 100%. For my exams if I want an A I gotta study my ass off so I know everything. I’ve seen people sit next to each other so they can share answers literally my anatomy lecture exam last week. I peeped at their score and they got a whole letter grade below me. Even with three minds who relied on each other to know the material didn’t succeed. I’m just sayin you shouldn’t judge people (circumstances like baby, family issues, rough week) and snitch on them because you could be in a similar situation in the future.",2025-02-28 03:18:57,79

I agree with him, even though it was a pain in the ass to write, it made me realize what is my level of understanding.

It's part of why I love CDS being less strict than CS, I can explore and learn and get more out of it and talk with professors who are leaders in their fields instead of panicking over my grade on an assignment. Wanting to learn more than just the lectures also means I explore beyond the basic class material in a way that often leads to top grades as a side effect. Most of life isn't gonna give you a rubric or a checklist or a numeric score. I had a company that I'd helped save millions of dollars a quarter by process improvement outside the scope of my basic data entry title give me an average score for performance because my raw numbers weren't as high... Because I set an entire team up for success. If it wasn't for office politics, I'd have been upper management soon enough.",2025-02-28 11:12:58,4

comment,Cheating culture,"Fortunately, cheating is taken very seriously as well. I've lost count of how many people failed classes or got suspended for using AI. There is a rumor on Reddit that professors cannot tell AI apart from human writing and that there is no way of proving it. That could not be further from the truth. There are few posts about failing classes, getting suspended or expelled despite how many times I've seen this happen. The risks are too high and denying worsens the consequences. Universities are catching on and are taking things very seriously. Why should the students who cheat cause group work grades to fail or suffer? And why should students who cheat be eligible for the honors, scholarships and support that honest students actually deserve? Report that mess. I saw someone who only used AI be awarded before she was busted and failed a class when a hardworking student could have received that award. Sure, it was very embarrassing for her when she was caught and she will not know how to answer basic interview questions after relying so heavily on AI so she will not get a decent job after graduating. But it went on for too long before it caught up with her. We should all report the students who cheat to pave the way for awards and scholarships going to the people who actually deserve it.",2025-08-06 00:47:04,1

comment,Cheating culture,"Do you not know how grading curves work? Cheaters inflate the class average, which inflates the curve values given out by the prof, so someone not cheating can receive a lower curved score with even one cheater. The secondary effect of this can be the professor not really knowing how their class is doing; if a section on paper is doing well because of cheaters, they won't know whether to properly adjust their lectures, give out additional resources, include grade makeup opportunities such as grade revisions/more graded coursework, etc.; from just this it can branch out: teachers receive worse RMP reviews, cheaters themselves drag down the institution's credibility when they f up in the future, people drop classes or switch majors because they can't do as well due to semester-long crappy curves/improper teacher adjustment.",2025-02-28 02:17:53,43

comment,Cheating culture,"What was Professors response? When the consequence of using AI to do your assignments is simply a new assignment or reduced points, or no consequence whatsoever, then it should be no surprise how prevalent it becomes. These students are devaluing the degree not only for themselves, but to everyone else with that same degree. When employers realize degrees are no longer representative of some basic ability to think critically, what is the outcome going to be? Sure, cheating has always existed.

There is an entire generation whose only academic skill set consists soley of copy pasting assignment instructions into a textbox. Idk about you, but that doesn't seem like a skill worth paying someone thousands of dollars a month for.

comment,Mason requires all students to be vaccinated by August 1st.,"Here’s the email for those who haven’t gotten it yet. Dear Patriots, We have just completed one of the most challenging times in the history of George Mason University, and I am grateful for the important role that everyone played in making this year a tremendous success. This week, I am pleased to share that we are reporting just one active case of COVID-19 on our campuses. Think about that for a moment. That’s an amazing accomplishment for our community and it is a testament to the number of people who have been vaccinated. As we turn our attention to the Fall Semester, we must all continue to do our part and work together to keep Mason safe. This starts with new policies for COVID-19 vaccination, testing and masking. Below is a summary of what we will require, so please read this carefully. COVID-19 Vaccination Students: Mason will require that all students be vaccinated against COVID-19 by August 1. This policy does not apply to students who take online courses only and do not come to any campus, or to individuals who have an approved medical or religious exemption. Plan ahead: Depending on the type of vaccine you receive, you may have to receive your first dose no later than July 4 to meet the August 1 requirement. Upload COVID vaccination documentation to the Health Services Patient Portal. Visit the Student Health Services website for FAQs, information on how to upload your COVID vaccine documentation (all students), or submit your Mason Immunization Record Form (newly admitted students). If you are an international student with limited access to COVID vaccines, please email immunize@gmu.edu to request an extension. Students with approved extensions must get vaccinated when they arrive in the United States. Faculty and Staff: All faculty and staff are expected to be fully vaccinated in time for the Fall Semester, and are strongly encouraged to receive vaccines over the summer. All employees are required to disclose whether or not they have been vaccinated in Mason Covid Health Check by June 11, 2021. Those who have been fully vaccinated will be required to upload vaccination documentation into the Health Services Patient Portal before August 1. We anticipate full FDA approval of at least one COVID vaccine over the summer. At that time, we anticipate requiring that all employees receive the vaccine. An exemption process will be made available. We encourage everyone to learn about the vaccine and get immunized. Mason will continue to host vaccination clinics on campus at no cost through the fall semester. To set up an appointment, go to vaccine.gmu.edu. Masking Mason will lift mask requirements for all fully vaccinated individuals on campus as of May 29 – except in medical facilities, public transit, child care facilities and in accordance with the Governor’s policy. Unvaccinated individuals should continue to wear masks on campus, per the Governor’s new executive order. Masks may be removed while eating, drinking, playing instruments and for other exemptions allowed. Mason will encourage everyone to wear masks in classes and indoors this summer, to allow more time for people to get vaccinated, and will support anyone who wants to continue wearing a mask after that. See Mason’s updated mask policy. Testing Unvaccinated individuals will be required to participate in COVID testing at least once a week and as frequently as three times a week, depending on conditions. Vaccinated faculty, staff and students may be required to participate in less frequent testing, based on the guidance from public health officials and testing capacity. Symptomatic individuals, whether vaccinated or unvaccinated, should still self-isolate and seek evaluation and diagnostic testing. Additional Safety Policies Physical Distancing: Mason will require physical distancing of three feet during the summer; in the fall, we anticipate being able to remove physical distancing requirements once vaccination rates exceed 80 percent. Mason COVID Health Check: Mason will continue to require everyone’s participation in the daily health check this summer; we will reassess the need for continuing in the fall, based on the vaccination data received. We have made tremendous strides during this extraordinary time. I continue to be amazed by the resilience of the Mason Nation. Let’s keep working together to keep Mason safe. Sincerely, Gregory Washington President",2021-05-26 14:36:35,53

On the other side, the maintenance of existing structures doesn't go away. The cost of them existing remains, and there are costs that a lot of people don't understand. For example shutting down a floor in the hotel I work at doesn't save as much as you think. We can't shut our heat or ac for long because lack of air circulation plus humidity promotes mold growth, which is far more expensive to treat than shutting everything off. We did cut our electric bill from 32k a month to 16k, but are only going to clear 70k this month instead of 700k. Paying for and implementing new online systems costs money, even if they are reducing salaries, saving on food service, there isn't a huge financial benefit to shutting down a campus.",2020-05-20 17:53:57,49

You cant have folks being given a pass in a class they would not have passed because then it just screws both them and their next teacher/classmates in the subject that's next up. If they tried to give a pass/fail based upon what the midterm grade is, then you screw over folks who could have turned things around, or assume that the course has provided enough information to where a student could do the next course in line competently. ____________ Now, that said, I do think Mason should have been more flexible on allowing students to take a full refund and drop their classes without any penalties. And certainly, professors should be ready to do some curving based upon how students did pre-midterm and post-midterm. But you can't just ""universal pass"". That's a pipe dream and crazy talk.",2020-03-31 00:39:50,4

post,I Made a Rate My Professors Chrome Extension for the GMU Patriot web!,"I Made a Rate My Professors Chrome Extension for the GMU Patriot web! &#x200B; [Rate My GMU Professors in Action](https://i.redd.it/p1tbnqx1tbi71.gif) [Link to Google Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/rate-my-gmu-professors/fmfmoojahahhnhakilofodgnlnfmagin) Hello, my name is [Jeong Min Cho](https://jeongmincho.me/) ! I am a senior computer science major student at George Mason University. After three rejections from the Google Chrome Web Store, I have finally published my extension to the store! I can proudly introduce my Google Chrome Extension called ""Rate My GMU Professors"". &#x200B; 🤔 What is it? Rate My GMU Professors will automatically parse professors' reviews data from Rate My Professors and display the user-friendly data on the Patriot pages. 📖 A little bit of the back story I have been thinking about this idea for a while, but I hadn't been motivated enough to work on the idea until one of my teammates from PatriotHacks 2021 (which [our team won](https://devpost.com/software/favorr)! YAY! 💪) had the same idea during the brainstorming. Although our team has chosen another idea over this idea, I thought that if I had some free time in the future, I should definitely make this. Before the starting of the Fall 2021 semester, I had some free time. While I could just sit back again enjoy the summer break, I decided to make something as a side project that helps other students. Hence, this idea perfectly fits the categories. 🕹️ How to use 1. Download Rate My GMU Professors from Chrome Web Store 2. Make sure Rate My GMU Professors are active. 3. Go to the Patriot web page. 4. Browse any classes with professors’ name 5. Now, under the professors’ names, you are able to see their Rate My Professors scores. 6. If you click the score number, you will be redirected to the professor’s Rate My Professors web page. 7. If you hover your mouse, you will be a pop-up showing the professor’s name, school, department, overall score, would-take-again percentage, level of difficulty, the total number of reviews, top tag &#x200B; ❗ Do you have any suggestions or questions? Feel free to reply here or email it to me! [jeongmincho@outlook.com](mailto:jeongmincho@outlook.com) &#x200B; Thank you for reading guys. I will see you on the GMU campus! &#x200B; &#x200B; [Search for Classes - Classic in Action](https://preview.redd.it/qmumm5evyii71.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=3f5c75a059184291452f65e7ad4813d0a6259475) EDIT 8/20/2021 - In version 1.0.3, I have added support for ""Search for Classes - Classic"" as u/GGX_TRIHARD_DRIVE_BY requested! It is being reviewed by Google (Usually, it takes one or two days to be reviewed), so it is not published yet. But, the feature is already implemented, so you will be able to use it in the future!! 💪 &#x200B; EDIT 8/21/2021 - Version 1.0.3 Released Enjoy! &#x200B;",2021-08-19 10:40:23,204
