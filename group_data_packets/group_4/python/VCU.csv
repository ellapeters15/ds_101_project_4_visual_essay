(WRIC) — Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) Health and the Children’s Hospital of Richmond at VCU have suspended gender-affirming care for patients under 19 years old in the wake of President Donald Trump’s executive order that cuts federal funding for such care. The following statement can be found on the Children’s Hospital’s webpage on transgender services as of Thursday, Jan. 30: ""VCU Health and Children’s Hospital of Richmond at VCU have suspended gender-affirming medication and gender-affirming surgical procedures for those under 19 years old in response to clear guidance from the state provided to VCU. We are committed to ensuring that we’re always delivering care in accordance with the law. Appointments will be maintained to discuss specific care options for patients in compliance with the most recent guidance.” This move would make the Richmond hospital one of several that’s put such care on hold as healthcare facilities consider the impacts of Trump’s order, according to the Associated Press.""",2025-01-30 22:17:46,1065

post,Palestinian American Student & Dad: 200 Relatives Killed in Gaza; VCU Withholds Diploma for Protest,"Palestinian American Student & Dad: 200 Relatives Killed in Gaza; VCU Withholds Diploma for Protest >Virginia Commonwealth University is withholding the diploma of a Palestinian American student because of her campus activism. In a hearing Tuesday, officials examined the case of VCU student Sereen Haddad, who was told she would not receive her diploma at her graduation this year because of her participation in a peaceful memorial commemorating violent police arrests at a student encampment for Palestine in 2024. Sereen Haddad is the daughter of Tariq Haddad, a cardiologist who grew up in Gaza. Dr. Haddad made headlines last year for rejecting an invitation to meet with then-Secretary of State Antony Blinken because of the Biden administration’s support for Israel’s actions in Gaza. The Haddads have lost more than 200 members of their extended family in the nearly two-year-long assault. >[Democracy Now!] speak[s] to the duo about the repression and retaliation that Sereen has faced for her student activism as she awaits a final decision by the university on the conferral of her degree. “Whatever VCU decides, I have made peace with the fact that I don’t need a university who is materially invested in a genocide’s approval,” she tells Democracy Now! “I am on the right side of history, and I don’t need a university to tell me that.”",2025-07-23 10:53:54,843

comment,Palestinian American Student & Dad: 200 Relatives Killed in Gaza; VCU Withholds Diploma for Protest,It seems that VCU issued a ban on sidewalk chalking after a student group used the tactic to raise awareness about VCU’s involvement supporting Israel during the apartheid/genocide. The student gathering she took part in resulted in no arrests. It was a gathering of less than 150 people on a lawn on campus that the university encouraged for informal gatherings. https://rvamag.com/politics/palestinian-american-students-diploma-withheld-by-vcu-story-goes-global.html,2025-07-23 20:48:21,5

post,College is the most isolating and lonely experience you will ever have,"College is the most isolating and lonely experience you will ever have Hi. I’m not blaming VCU, as this would undoubtedly be the same in any college I would have happened to go to, but college in general is so destructive on mental health if you struggle to make and maintain friendships. High school is easy. Make a friend in a class and hang with them every day, as it is forced. College you can vibe with someone but you will likely not see them out of the club or class you met them in, and once that class ends for the semester, you can kiss that friendship goodbye. And thus you are left empty, feeling like you’ll never have close friends. You’ll always be left out, the odd one out. This is just an extreme rant and I hope it isn’t removed. I needed to get it off my chest. I’m so sick of being alone.",2024-01-22 15:16:51,377

comment,College is the most isolating and lonely experience you will ever have,"Hey dude, I can definitely relate. Making friends as an adult can be very challenging, especially now when all we want to do is stare at our phones rather than make conversation. Your feelings are 100% valid.

Invite your classmates to study session, make small talk with your classmates, etc. It's hard but eventually you will find your herd. Good luck!",2024-01-22 15:56:02,52

comment,College is the most isolating and lonely experience you will ever have,"Hey pal. I went to VCU from 2013-2017. My freshman year was just like this. I even spent a weekend on MCV in the mental ward after trying to unalive myself. I was miserable. So miserable. But then I joined some clubs I liked. Made some friends. The best friends I ever had in my life. I started to really enjoy my studies. Made even more friends in my major. I had friends everywhere at this point. I created a club. Joined a frat (I’m a girl so it was academic). College bloomed afterwards. I don’t say this to brag. I say this to tell you: hold on, it gets better. You will find your place at VCU, I know it. It’s a magical school that has a place for everyone. I miss it and Richmond dearly. The happiest times of my life came right after the worst. I’ll be thinking of you, fellow Ram.

comment,College is the most isolating and lonely experience you will ever have,"I'm currently a VCU student with a full time job and courseload. I have lots of friends, and a few close ones that I met here so this is what I would say from my experience, especially as someone who doesn't really socialize often: • join VCU discords (there's a discord feature that lets you browse VCU servers), and just talk to people there until you find someone (or multiple people) with similar interests. I'm a CS major so it's very easy for my classmates to have all sorts of nerdy hobbies we bond over. • look beyond the traditional college experience for places to find friends. You mentioned meeting people outside of school at clubs and stuff but honestly I've never been to one. Pick up new hobbies and make friends there. If you make a friend in class ask them what they do for fun and do those things with them. As an adult, friendships take investment because if everyone is busy, they are going to prioritize what's best for them (and rightfully so), so if you make yourself an asset to your friends (because you're a good person, or because you've particularly connected with someone), that definitely helps motivate them to want to hang outside of class, and outside of the semester • Reach out to friends you had in class even when you don't have class. This is as simple as checking on someone if they talked about doing something at some point in the future (hey, how did x thing go?). Shows you're interested and you care. Make sure to actually get some contact info (group assignment is a good excuse to get phone numbers or other means of contact like discord usernames or social media handles). Once you have contact info, the onus is on you to try to connect! Not everyone will be consistent enough to hit you back (some people are very flaky), but do it enough times someone will feel cared for. • think about what YOU look for in a long term friend, and be that for other people. We aren't as unique as we all tend to think we are, so someone else probably feels just like you do. This is a good example of when empathy is important, because understanding someone is a great way to make them want to invest in you back.",2024-01-23 06:26:16,5
comment,College is the most isolating and lonely experience you will ever have,"I’m sorry dude. I was the same way while attending and just started getting out of my shell when the pandemic hit. What helped me was just getting out into town. Study at some different coffee shops and look for event by bell isle. There are always nice people there to talk with. That being said as “inclusive” as VCU tries to be, it really is just a fad to get incoming freshman in. Once you signed your tuition check they could honestly care less. I wish they would actually focus on fighting that instead of battling it at surface level. Ralph is all about those dollar bills",2024-01-22 21:19:23,4
comment,College is the most isolating and lonely experience you will ever have,"At risk of giving too much information about myself. Honestly I think this may just be a VCU experience. I graduated from VCU but had attended JMU for two years before transferring. It was very easy to make friends at JMU, there was a huge sense of community and the university really pushes it. I felt like the clubs at JMU were better developed and supported by the university. I also think that there was way less to do Harrisonburg and so it kind of forced the student body to develop an internal community. VCU was the complete opposite. I found the student body I guess less friendly. There was less community building from the university and the class sizes are a lot larger than what I experienced at JMU. It became easier to make friends when your classes are small. There are also way more students at VCU just in general. I found getting a job (well I had to to pay for bills) at VCU was where I made friends with coworkers. But I felt the same way as you do at VCU. Granted I was 3-4 years older than my classmates and while it doesn’t seem like a huge deal but there is a big maturity difference between a 22 year old and an 18 year.",2024-01-23 07:22:52,5

Seconding and thirding what others have said - clubs, intramurals, saying hi to someone new each day. Maybe try Bumble BFF, or the VCU page for your class (there's usually one for each graduating year). When I made some good friends, everything felt so much better, and VCU truly felt like home.

comment,College is the most isolating and lonely experience you will ever have,"I felt very similar for much of my time at VCU.

It may be more difficult and take more persistent effort than in high school, but I hope you are able to see that a fulfilling and engaging social life is very much within reach. Part of it is just learning how to nurture friendships outside of the structure high school provides. I can guarantee you that there are so many other students who feel the exact same way you do now.

comment,College is the most isolating and lonely experience you will ever have,"I know it sounds ignorant but be uncomfortable. I used to be introverted up until 9th grade but I began high school in a new county, 30 miles away from my friends. I had to build up a system of friends from scratch, and it was fairly easy. Met some in the band, classes, clubs, etc. Then by the time of graduation I had more friends than I could count. One of my hardest struggles was having a mild stutter when I was younger. I chose to make myself uncomfortable by making small talk with literally anyone, from random people in my classes, to teachers, even to random people at the gym. This slowly became apart of my personality. As a freshman entering my second semester, it feels like I’m making more friends than I could count. In classes, clubs, gym, dining halls, etc. Even if you have a few friends you could probably get to know mutual friends.

I cannot emphasize enough to branch out at VCU and in the broader RVA community. Volunteer for habitat for humanity, participate in the ASPIRE or other learning communities, or find literally any other group who you are willing to meet with on a semi-regular basis.

I got none of that. I moved an hour away from where my family and friends are to be closer to work and so my parents could have their place back that I was renting from them. Not only did my bills double moving to a city from the country my mental health and anxiety has taken a crazy turn for the worse.

There have been ZERO surgeries preformed on minors aged 12 and below, and the ones preformed on older teenagers are extremely rare and have only ever been to the chest. Hormone blockers are irreversible, you just stop taking them. HRT is NOT ""False Chemicals,"" it is hormones. You know, like the ones that everyone has? There has been no ""genital mutilation"" to children. And have you ever seen post-OP, healed, GAS surgery? If done well, which in most cases it is, a person can look completely cis. No ""mutilation"" like you think. Trans people are MUCH happier after taking HRT because it's whats right for them. There have been MANY studies to prove this. For all you disgusting people who obviously can't think for yourself, I feel sorry for you. Sorry that you hold so much hate in your hearts that you can't see out of the narrow views you hold. Just because you don't understand something, that doesn't make it a bad thing. For those that are willing to learn more, I advise you to read this: https://genderdysphoria.fyi/en/printable",2025-01-31 23:45:05,5

comment,"Vcu health, wtf","Children should be children. Why do they NEED to alter their physical bodies at such a young age? You're doing incredibly unnatural things to a still developing body. Why should they not be close to adulthood to *make a choice that will permanently alter the rest of their lives*?? Why can they not just change their hairstyle, clothing style, and express themselves through makeup until they reach an age where they have more experience and a *literally more matured brain*? Instead of putting such a damn heavy emphasis on the genders of children, maybe we should focus on *teaching them life skills*. Where the hell are you people's priorities, seriously???? And its not banning people from getting gender affirming healthcare, its just putting an age bar on it. Like drinking and smoking, joining the military, watching media featuring the genitalia yall are so obsessed with. Please, explain to me the problem here, and tell me why chemically altering a young person's body is the most important thing here.",2025-01-31 19:00:57,4
comment,"Vcu health, wtf","I could be understanding it wrong, but an executive order still has to be followed.

A lot of what he's saying, in general, he can't actually back up. His administration and even possibly him, know this, they're just using shit like this tweet to get you stirred up, even though nothing will come of it, and then you'll be looking ""over here"", while they do the real damage ""over there."" That seems to be the plan in general from where I stand anyway. Say a bunch of ridiculous shit, like what he's saying here, or the 51st state of Canada, both ridiculous and most likely won't happen, but it's a good diversion tactic for the mass public who doesn't really understand how things work, get them stirred up and waste their time worrying about nonsense while they make the real moves that'll put anyone working class or below down, eventually....

comment,VCU withholding degrees of three pro-Palestine student protesters,"The title “VCU withholding degrees of three pro-Palestine student protesters” is misleading, as it oversimplifies and omits key context.

Staff, security, and police approached the students multiple times over three hours, informing them the protest was in a non-designated area and instructing them to move to the nearby Park Plaza Amphitheater. Some students refused to relocate.

comment,VCU withholding degrees of three pro-Palestine student protesters,"Didn't get past the Times-Disgrace's paywall. (Is it still the typo-ridden mess it used to be?) Some thoughts. No one should be denied a degree based on exercising their First Amendment rights. I've seen it happen for disciplinary reasons, usually until there was an admission of the violation with or without mitigating factors and restitution if university property was damaged. Based on some of the comments, i think a lot of people are forgetting that Hamas is not all Palestinians, just as the Isreali government is not all Jews or even all Isrealis and the Trump administration is not all Americans. One can support an end to violence against one (ideally both) sides of the conflict without supporting those inflicting the violence. The attack by Hamas was horrible, but the IDF's bombing of refugees and preventing basic supplies like food, water, and medicine from Gaza is horrible as well. As we comment back and forth, we should focus on the facts of this situation and the 1st Amendment issues, not the geopolitical mess that spurred these students to protest. Just my $0.02.",2025-05-14 11:23:55,1
comment,VCU withholding degrees of three pro-Palestine student protesters,VCU warned for 3 hours that they were in violation and did not seek authorization to do this event but then tried to accommodate them by offering relocating. I’m sorry but sometimes you bring it on yourself. I don’t necessarily agree with withholding degrees but seriously the students don’t pick their battles. They pick every battle. This could easily been resolved with alittle cooperation. VCU could have just said you didn’t request authorization or anything/kicked them out completely but the students didn’t want to compromise when VCU offered solutions.,2025-05-14 15:14:16,1

comment,VCU students walk out in protest of visa revocations: ‘You need to protect the students’,"EDIT FOR CLARIFICATION: This is an opinion based on the LOGIC that the behavior of ICE seems like they have information about a students hour-to-hour scheduled. If there was a link, or proof, of this happening it would be a national news story. Hope that clears up what I mean. Original comment: This is my take, ICE has been on campus two days that I know about in the past couple of weeks. Both times they drove to a specific building, entered, and then left. That seems like they knew it was likely someone would be in that building. And that information is stored in personal google or apple calendars, and in eServices. It is totally possible that google or apple is giving up that information about someone’s schedule, but I imagine it would be easier to pressure VCU. I believe it is the latter. Rao has gotten so much cover from and had their 70 million dollar mistake forgiven by Youngkin. It is highly likely that VCU admin is providing ICE with student information.",2025-04-15 16:15:13,32

comment,VCU students walk out in protest of visa revocations: ‘You need to protect the students’,"You seem to be missing some information as to how the FAFSA works or you are MAJORLY oversimplifying it… yes you fill out the FAFSA before the school year starts, but that doesn’t mean your aid amount is already determined. It is simply so that they have your information and can get the process done quickly. You fill out the form and they process it, using the information provided, they get a number of how much aid you qualify for, dependent on how many credits you plan on taking, but they don’t post that information yet because they don’t know how many credits you’re taking. So they send the information to VCU, or whatever college, to figure out how much aid you will get. VCU, or whatever college, will then send the requested information to the department so they look at it and determine exactly how much you qualify for. Then they, essentially, give VCU the monetary amount of aid you qualified for and say, hey, this money is for this student to cover a portion or all of their tuition. Your comment makes it sound like you fill out the application and the department sends your application to the school and then their job is done and the school decides how much aid you get. When it comes to the PELL Grant and other federal/state aid. VCU can’t control how much of it you get, the government does.

comment,VCU students walk out in protest of visa revocations: ‘You need to protect the students’,Well international students do have to provide proof of enrollment for the terms of their visa. That includes which specific courses and sections theyre taking in a semester which basically is their class schedule. We don’t know the exact reason why those students were specifically targeted by ICE. For all we know they could’ve been taking under the required minimum of courses they should be or they’re taking more virtual vs online classes or they never resubmitted a document they were supposed to or something much worse. If VCU is involved I wouldn’t be surprised if the extent was them just confirming information that the student already agreed to share.,2025-04-16 08:56:41,2

These are not life altering surgeries, they're life SAVING treatments done with the knowledge and consent of the child's parents and doctors. Decisions about whether only social transition is needed or whether the child should take puberty blockers and HRT are not made quickly or rashly. These practices have been going on for decades without controversy until anti-trans sentiment got ramped up for political reasons. Mind you, the points you made don't stand or aren't comparable when you remember that this is HEALTHCARE we're talking about here, not bodily harm like with smoking or going to war, and in Virginia parents CAN consent to giving their child a tattoo and drink alcohol at private residences. Hormone therapy and puberty blockers ARE reversible by the way, and the majority of children only go thru social transition, but the ones that need puberty blockers to alleviate their dysphoria are just as valid for needing them for medically necessary reasons as children who need them to prevent a harmful precocious puberty.

I don’t have an encyclopedic understanding or anything but I’m also not out here “educating” people about what protests are and aren’t valid. I support the Israeli and Palestinian people affected by this violence, and do not condone the actions of the Israeli government or Hamas, but the latter is a direct response to actions of the former. I’m not going to solve Israel-Palestine in Reddit comments and neither are any of you, so please stop attacking Jewish people who have the “gall” to speak their minds on the subject.

comment,Pro-Palestine VCU students march through Richmond to protest war in Gaza,The students should be more guided in their protests and aim their anger at the Israeli Likud govt and not Israel in general as the majority of Israelis don’t support what Netanyahu is doing and are protesting him and the Likud govt party who are failing the Israelis. Protest corrupt Netanyahu and his racist right wing politics who control the Israeli military. Student protesters need to wake up and realize who is causing the trouble in Israel- The Likud party and their corrupt leader and Hamas who stole the govt from the Palestinians not the moderate majority of the Israeli population who don’t condone what the Likud party is doing and making moderate Israel look bad fueling antisemitism with the way they are handling the war. The Israeli military takes their orders from Netanyahu and his war cabinet. The majority of the protesters at VCU sound like they aren’t educated in what they should be protesting- the brutality of the Likud party against the Palestinians who are not Hamas fighters and the corrupt prime minister who gives the military their orders. Things are always more complicated than protesting against Israel’s actions and being Pro Palestinian both of their governments are corrupt and are misguiding people’s actions on both sides.,2024-10-08 22:56:24,2

Secondly, holy shit the war on terror has been nothing but an excuse to bomb completely random brown people and to conduct mass surveillance in the name of patriotism. ETA: you can look at the attacks on October 7th as a prison break, if that helps (Palestine is colloquially referred to as the world's largest outdoor prison; Israel has quite a breadth of restrictions on what's allowed in and has a multi-tiered legal system with identification cards.

comment,High school seniors be like,2.8 with what sat. I have a 1140 sat and 2.7 Gpa but I’ve done a internship and jobs and tutored kids for 2 different organizations and like 38 service hours. Other things as well. I also have a progressive increase in my gpa 2.4-2.5-3.1 that’s freshman to junior year. And then first quarter of senior year I finished with a 4.2 but sadly VCU can’t see that. But VCU is my top choice and I’m so fucking nervous.,2020-12-05 14:09:38,1

post,Alleged VCU frat hazing death,Alleged VCU frat hazing death I have seen quite a few posts online today about a VCU frat hazing a kid then him later dying of alcohol poisoning that night. I was wondering if anyone has heard about this? Edit: here is a Twitter link with more info https://twitter.com/gothgrlrights/status/1365815349317414915?s=21 Edit 2: VCU has made an official statement https://twitter.com/vcu/status/1366089628072239109?s=21 Edit 3: https://mobile.twitter.com/tylerjthrasher/status/1366060229037862915?s=21 seems a Channel 8 reporter has begun following the story Edit 4:I am for holding people accountable and hope that the people how are responsible for this are punished but please do not post and personal information In this thread. Doxing is extremely dangerous and risks people who aren’t involved getting hurt.

By that I mean, shouldn't everything be based off of the best person for the job, the most qualified and not necessarily the color of a person's skin? Wasn't it MLK that said based a person by their character and not the color of their skin? It seems to me that DEI takes away from that notion. There will always be people that are racist, that will never change, racism happens on both sides and always will if we're being honest. But I will say, telling me I have to believe a man is a woman and vice versa isn't reality.

post,"Please remember to be safe at night, even if you don’t think you do (possible close encounter)","Please remember to be safe at night, even if you don’t think you do (possible close encounter) I was walking back from studying, on Grace St, a few mins after 1am (ik, ik) when I encountered a couple of guys hanging out outside. I didn’t think much of it, but when I crossed the street to the N side of Grace, they followed and approached me, and I heard one of them say “let’s hit this n****”. I was able to slink into insomnia cookies since I was literally right there, ordered 2 cookies, during which the guys seemingly lost interest in me and went on their way. I have been at VCU for 4 years now and haven’t really ever questioned my safety until now… especially since I am a 5’11” guy who is decently in shape. But please remember to be hypervigilant at night, especially if you are a member of a vulnerable population, but also if you aren’t and don’t think anything can happen to you! When I got back to my car, I drove around to see if they were around anywhere so I could potentially get a picture to report them, but I couldn’t find them. Not sure if I should report them at this point as I don’t have much of a description other than “2 guys who were black and looked like they were in their 20’s” At the time, there was no one immediately outside near me, but there were a decent amount of people walking outside after I had gotten my cookies.",2025-10-11 02:00:44,195

Now they approached you instead of followed you… and they said let’s hit this guy… and you somehow knew they were talking about you because they approached you instead of followed you. Puh-lease. They reversed course after you went into a business? Like they stopped and didn’t follow you in or they stopped and met some people that were coming out or they just decided to go somewhere else? And they were completely gone when you left? Look… if they really wanted to “hit” you, they’d have waited around for you to come outside. “I do happen to be a white cis male, and I am privileged to be a member of demographic that is not a target of sexual violence or hate crimes.” For all the downvotes my original comment got, it looks like I called it… you’re a cis-white male which in this particular instance also means you’re more likely to be racially biased, especially at night and when you already perceive danger. Then given that these two people were minorities and POC you immediately assumed they were talking about you or targeting you. “This may have led to my complacency with walking alone late at night, though it is mostly that given my height and build, I did not perceive myself as being an easy target.” A target?! You were the victim of what… your own racial biases?! Target seems to indicate that something happened. Nothing happened aside from you accusing two people who were doing nothing of plotting something against you. “The only reason I even bothered to mention their race at all is to describe the individuals I encountered.” 💁‍♀️ what a helpful description… two black males in their 20s. — no clothing or body description or anything. So in point of fact the only thing that seemed to jump out to you about these guys was their race. “I don’t know why you are accusing me of being racist as I do not harbor negative feelings for any individuals on the basis of things they have no control over.” It’s pretty obvious why I accused you of being racist… you assumed the intention of two guys who you overheard make a comment that may or may not have been about you or directed to you and essentially told the world “watch out for two black guys at night, they may be committing crimes” it’s pretty basic Chad/Karen behavior. Here’s two black guys on the street existing at 1 am, they’re probably up to no good. I resisted replying to u/EvilChewbacca’s comments, but I’ll go ahead and reply to those now too: OP said he didn’t think much of it until he heard “let’s hit this n****” so it seems like they weren’t just two guys in the dark. They could’ve been talking to each other about something else who knows but it’s not a bad idea to be vigilant hearing that alone at night. Well it seems OP has now changed his story from being followed, which is creepy, to being approached. So maybe it was actually neither. Maybe he just saw these guys on the sidewalk, heard a comment - whether it was let’s hit this guy or what who knows. I’m not disagreeing it’s good to be vigilant. You absolutely should be. But airing your biases on the internet is wild! Like “hey I saw two black guys and got scared even as a cis-white male, so watch out everyone.” From personal experience I’ve been verbally accosted on Grace St multiple times in my year at VCU and everytime it was a group of young black men. That definitely sucks! I’ve been called slurs too (responding to what you said when someone asked you what accosted meant) but unless someone is getting super aggressive and looks like they’re going to assault me I don’t take it personally and keep it moving. Best to not engage. Personal anecdote is not reliable however so If you want demographic data the “Crime in Virginia 2023” report published by the department of state police is readily available online. https://rga.lis.virginia.gov/Published/2024/RD437/PDF OK… so you’re going to rely on data from systemically racist systems? If that’s the case intraracial crime is far more prevalent than interracial crime. So, there’s that too… Richmond is certainly a diverse city yes with lots of amazing people, there are also racists of course and criminals same as any other city. Don’t pretend however that safety at night is race blind because that’s ignorant of readily available information. WTF racist? Like “I’m not a racist but…I’ll cite arguably racist data and pretend like I’m not a racist and I’ll instead hint at saying be wary of POC at night” which you a Italy doubled down on later… Additionally Richmond is not a majority-black city making up about 28% of the population though it is a larger portion compared to the national average. Where the heck did you pull that number from? Census data indicates Richmond is 41% Black and 41.7% white. I also never said the city was majority Black I just indicated that the country is mostly free, though that’s probably less accurate than more accurate. But 28%…? To address the last bit, the harsh truth is that yes it’s justifiable to be more afraid of black people at night than white people. This doesn’t apply to all black people nor should you let it affect how you treat other people but the vast majority of criminals in Richmond are black. If you are to be murdered, robbed, car stolen or assaulted at night the offender will most likely be black. It’s a terrible problem within the community and there are numerous causes for the racial disparity but it’s a fact nonetheless. Until people can recognize these issues without being called racist they will never be fixed only perpetuating the racial divide in our country. OK MAGA… listen… you’re all over the place there you’re trying to say there is systemic inequities and systemic problems but also trying to say that Black people and POC are still the cause of the problem.",2025-10-14 10:26:11,-1

comment,"Please remember to be safe at night, even if you don’t think you do (possible close encounter)","I used this source for Richmond population data, it encompasses the entire Richmond Metropolitan Statistical Area of which 28% are black. https://datausa.io/profile/geo/richmond-va-31000US40060 You are correct that using the more specific Richmond data roughly 41% is black and 41% white. https://datausa.io/profile/geo/richmond-va/ I overlooked that the first source was for the MSA. Regardless, this is rather irrelevant as I used state wide crime data. You accuse this data of being useless as it’s from a systemically racist institution. I can guarantee that even if the rate of false convictions / arrests was at its all time peak there would not be significant statistical change in crime rates by race, that’s how wide the difference is. Additionally the report differentiates convictions and arrests meaning the cases used were rendered guilty verdicts in a fair court of law. The crime rates by race data in the report is consistent nationwide and has been for years on end. Even if there are flaws in the criminal justice system those are not primarily responsible for what the statistics say. Also, I am not saying that “black people are the problem” simply that they commit vastly more crimes at a higher rate across every age / sex demographic. The causes behind that are numerous including: Poor access to safe low income housing, culture, community location, holdovers of America’s systemically racist past, illegal firearm access, drug use etc. I am not MAGA lol and far from it. As I stated, until people can acknowledge the factual reality of Americas crime demographics honestly it will never change. And as you mentioned, intraracial crime is exceedingly more common than interracial. The majority of Americas gun violence (excluding suicide) comes from black teens shooting each other, it is black communities being the most impacted by the crime epidemic. The view that acknowledging controversial problems like this is racist negatively impacts the minority populations themselves.",2025-10-14 17:48:09,1

comment,Student arrested at VCU gathering to mark the anniversary of Gaza encampment,"This time? Not that I know of, this scenario just seems like a poor arrest but this is also the first I’m hearing of it. The one that happened last year? Pretty much. Last year, they started setting up tents and stating they were gonna stay there all night, that, by definition, is an encampment. VCU policy CLEARLY states that unless you have a permit, encampments are not permitted. The protest was peaceful when it first started, in fact, I participated, up until they pulled out tents. I left because, unlike those people, I actually read VCU’s policies when applying and before I accepted the offer and knew what they were doing wasn’t allowed. They were told to leave because it was un permitted and a lot of them refused. The police showed up, because that’s literally their job, to make sure un permitted protestors dispersed. And I saw the videos, videos that were proudly posted by the protestors. That shit was NOT peaceful once they were told to leave by PD. I mean they were literally throwing water bottles at the cops. When asked about it, most of them either denied that it happened, despite video evidence, or said it was self defense, which isn’t a valid claim. I won’t argue that VCU isn’t shit and that maybe VCU and the cops went about it poorly. But you don’t fight with the cops on site, you wanna fight the cops? Do it in court. Can’t afford a lawyer? Well if you were arrested, you get one for free. I’m sure there are also plenty of “only pay if you win” lawyers if you wanna sue that badly.",2025-04-30 10:44:20,1

comment,Student arrested at VCU gathering to mark the anniversary of Gaza encampment,"Your comment seems to be oversimplifying some stuff. Just because SJP declared the end of the OFFICIAL event, doesn’t really mean shit. I mean the way you worded it, is literally the main problem we’re having with the current administration. It’s misinformation, whether intentional or not. Yes, SJP “ended” the event, but that doesn’t mean the protest stopped, it just means the organizer is pulling out. Were they still holding up their signs? Was the reason they were still there for a cause? This example may not be perfect, but it’s the best I can think of at this time. When we left the United Kingdom, did their government cease to exist? Did their duties change? No, they continued to exist. Or maybe this example is better. I did not make my work schedule, my boss did. Now she’s there when I arrive, but she left before I was scheduled to leave. Well I wouldn’t be there if she didn’t put me on the schedule, but that doesn’t mean my shift is over just because hers was. When SJP disbanded the event, that didn’t automatically turn the protestors into people that just wanted to chill on the lawn. They were still protesting, they were just doing it without the affiliation of an organizer. What VCU did, it was terrible, and I sympathize with those people that got injured. BUT you can NOT play the victim in that scenario. You even admit that they were told the event was unauthorized, the SECOND they were told that, they should have put the signs away and went about their day. They could have came back at a later date with a permit, it’s not like it’s hard to get one. Like I said earlier, you wanna fight the cops? You wanna fight VCU?

They are not being “mutilated” and to use such incorrect language causes further pain and humiliation for these poor young people. This is all aimed at less than 1% of the population.

If this goes to the Supreme Court I’m prepared to also lose access to the care that saved my life. It was never about protecting kids. Children will absolutely die because of this. “Nobody’s taking it away, they just have to wait.” I made three attempts on my life waiting to start my transition.

Trump's recent executive order just bans certain divisive concepts, not whole subjects. Here is the section of the order defining the ""discriminatory equity ideology"" which the order bans. It does not mention Critical Race Theory per se but just concepts that it teaches: >Sec. 2. Definitions. >(b) “Discriminatory equity ideology” means an ideology that treats individuals as members of preferred or disfavored groups, rather than as individuals, and minimizes agency, merit, and capability in favor of immoral generalizations, including that: >(i) Members of one race, color, sex, or national origin are morally or inherently superior to members of another race, color, sex, or national origin; >(ii) An individual, by virtue of the individual’s race, color, sex, or national origin, is inherently racist, sexist, or oppressive, whether consciously or unconsciously; >(iii) An individual’s moral character or status as privileged, oppressing, or oppressed is primarily determined by the individual’s race, color, sex, or national origin; >(iv) Members of one race, color, sex, or national origin cannot and should not attempt to treat others without respect to their race, color, sex, or national origin; >(v) An individual, by virtue of the individual’s race, color, sex, or national origin, bears responsibility for, should feel guilt, anguish, or other forms of psychological distress because of, should be discriminated against, blamed, or stereotyped for, or should receive adverse treatment because of actions committed in the past by other members of the same race, color, sex, or national origin, in which the individual played no part; >(vi) An individual, by virtue of the individual’s race, color, sex, or national origin, should be discriminated against or receive adverse treatment to achieve diversity, equity, or inclusion; >(vii) Virtues such as merit, excellence, hard work, fairness, neutrality, objectivity, and racial colorblindness are racist or sexist or were created by members of a particular race, color, sex, or national origin to oppress members of another race, color, sex, or national origin; or >(viii) the United States is fundamentally racist, sexist, or otherwise discriminatory. https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/ending-radical-indoctrination-in-k-12-schooling/ Banning these concepts from public education should not be controversial.

comment,Hibbs hall is scary,"Yeah. Where Shafer is now, that used to be the old biology building. Two floors, kinda blue. The library looked much different then too. Hibbs, looked the same on the exterior. Anyhow, the main dining hall was on the first floor, staff on the second. Anyone could use the staff one, better food, but shorter hours. This all being said, back in the late 90s there wasn't really like ""choices"" for food. Nothing like what Shafer is now. Weekends were limited to such glorious options as boiled hot dogs, creamed corn, or you could go get some cereal. That was risky, the milk temp gauge was commonly pegged in the red. Pretty much a guaranteed bowel movement thereafter, affectionately referred to as getting your PHD (post Hibbs dump). It was a miracle when they brought in a rotisserie chicken cooker. At first, they'd give you a whole bird. If you were smart, you'd cut it up, stock away some in tupperware and take it to the dorm fridge so the weekends weren't awful.

post,I was followed by man on campus. Here's his description,"I was followed by man on campus. Here's his description I called the VCUPD non-emergency line and reported this. Yesterday around 1:30 I was followed for a few blocks by an older white man. He was bald, blue gingham button down shirt, navy laptop case with a handle, and tan (?) pants. He also was of medium build and had a short white beard. I'm very experienced with cities and have lived in them my whole life. I just had this deep feeling in my gut about him that I couldn't explain. He was already speaking to a girl who looked uncomfortable as I walked past in Monroe park. I assumed maybe he was asking for directions, money, ect. Normal yet uncomfortable city interactions. He started to walk behind me sometime after I passed. He stopped another girl to ask her something, then went back to following me. This was on Laurel. he caught me at the light and started to walk very close. I decided to walk into blue bones vintage and assumed he wouldn't follow me there. Honestly, I thought I was being paranoid, but he did. When the man was distracted looking at something, I quietly told the guy behind the register that he kept trying to talk to girls and was possibly following me. He looked pretty stoned and just nodded. I asked what to do and he shrugged. go figure. I sighed and left the store with the old man following behind. once I turned the corner on broad I began to run to put some space between us. Once he rounded the corner he stood for a moment looking around. We accidentally made eye contact and he started walking in my direction. I made it to my building before he caught up to me and called the non-emergency line. I don't want to scare anyone by sharing this story. Its just important to me that I share incase anyone sees him or has had a similar experience. It may have been nothing, but its important to trust your gut. Thank you. EDIT: this was at 1:30 PM in broad daylight and I was going to a class. And yes I am a college aged young woman. Thank you to those who have asked if I’m okay - I really appreciate. I must ask that before you think about commenting something I may have done wrong, please be understanding of the fact that I was very scared while still asserting myself. I also think I handled it pretty well considering the circumstance 😅",2024-10-16 15:29:56,157
comment,I was followed by man on campus. Here's his description,"If something like that happens again, try to keep your head and look along nearby walls for a yellow VCU police call box. Some of them have a yellow light on them. It was a good idea to head for the nearest busy street. If you're on a sidestreet and it's safe to do so, go to the middle of the street. It'll look weird if he follows. There's a little VCU police office on Grace next to Au Bon Pain. You might stop in there and give them a heads-up about him. The officers there know the neighborhood regulars and they can keep an eye out for him. Run by Barnes and Noble. I think I saw pepper spray there near the breezeway entrance. A whistle might be handy, also. If you blew a whistle at him, he'd probably go away. Sorry that happened to you, I know it's unnerving. There's an apartment building full of old people on Grace. He could be a dirty old man with dementia. Probably harmless but best not to find out.",2024-10-16 15:55:23,62

comment,I was followed by man on campus. Here's his description,"eye contact can be okay to a certain degree. don't look shy, as this could come across as encouraging his behavior. don't prolong eye contact, just brief enough to be clear and assertive. also, don't be afraid to be a bit vocal (not violent or rude, just be assertive). turn around, look him in the eyes, and yell ""stop following me!"" not only will this hopefully deter him, but it will also let people nearby know what's going on.",2024-10-16 16:17:14,16

comment,I was followed by man on campus. Here's his description,"im curious to if he was wearing boots? or usually wears a button down shirt and brown boots. ive seen a man with that description walking around. i was by myself meeting friends at the known thrift store around vcu (im not sure of the name but im pretty sure its rumors). i was walking from my dorm, gladding residence center, around 4pm i think and as im passing monroe park i saw that man AGAIN, with that description, about late 50's to 60's im assuming, he stared at me literally just staring into my soul and he started walking the direction i was going. he kept following me but he kept matching my speed, i kept walking faster and faster and then slower and he kept doing the same. i was passing the taco place thats otw to the thrift store right before you turn the corner and i thank god saw one of my friends walking. it was a relief seeing him instead of my girl friends i was meeting up with because i dont think he would've left if he saw us. it was my guy friend i ran into and hes more on the intimidating side of physical appearance. its weird to say but hes on the tall and lowkey like super built buff guy type of beat and i told him if about the guy and we both turned around and made eye contact with him and the guy i think was pretending to take a phone call? and turned around and walked the other direction. i think he scared him off which thank god . mind you this was atleast the 3rd time ive seen him. he lingers around monroe park like around the outside of the park. i havent brought this up with any of my friends but then i saw this post and i think we saw the same man.",2024-10-17 04:15:57,4

post,Rao is full of shit,"Rao is full of shit VCU has been completely silent for months about the protests. No statement when Commonwealth Times reporters were pepper sprayed and arrested. No statement when VCU students were pulled off the streets by unmarked police vans on May 31st. No statement when hundreds of students and thousands of Richmonders were tear gassed in an incident so unjustified that the mayor apologized and fired the police chief. But now, a university that makes over 1 billion dollars a semester from tuition alone, is outraged over some broken windows and fucked up patio furniture? Give me a break. For y’all that don’t live here, there’s been 2 months of peaceful protests and 3 days of actual violence (May 29th, May 30th, and July 26th). Almost all of the violence has been caused by RPD just shooting teargas indiscriminately into crowds of people. If you don’t believe me, I was there and I have weeks of videos, @GoadGatsby and @aeringle have even more. If you didn’t already know, VCU’s “diversity” bullshit is a gimmick. This school doesn’t care if you’re poor, a minority, or queer. All it cares about is if you can pay it’s outrageous tuition so it can buy new buildings on Broad St. If you don’t agree with the protests, whatever, you’re in the minority on this campus and in this country. However, don’t let VCU’s bullshit statements be the thing that sways you. It’s not the full story, and it’s certainly not from a university that cares about its students.",2020-07-27 06:51:52,158

comment,Rao is full of shit,It wasn't. BLM757 led the crowd into monroe park and out of it but once people found out who they were they dispersed and did their own thing. Also these white supremacists work with the police openly so I kinda doubt that the people doing this was them Furthermore stop trusting RPD. We're protesting them for a reason. Take what they say with a grain of salt cause they always try to make themselves look better.

comment,Rao is full of shit,"Listen, bootlicker, none of that shit is happening here. No one is fighting in the streets. The only shit that’s been burned is trash cans and 3 vehicles that all belonged to the state. Nobody’s homes or apartments got burned down, the Richmond Fire Department came out and said the police were lying about the arson accusations. The only actual damage committed to the city was caused on May 30th, a day where the entire fucking country was rioting. Richmond is not a shitty place. It’s a place where thousands of us have come together to protest an unjust system and police department. It’s a place where ex-confederate monuments have been turned into community spaces where people play basketball and distribute food to the needy. It’s a place where we’re confronting our painful past, rather than hiding from it. If YOU are uncomfortable at the concept of black liberation at any cost, then nobody could care less. You’re naive to think this 350+ year old struggle is going to be completely peaceful, especially when the police violently oppress large peaceful protests (June 1st). It’s obvious that you’re ignoring the larger issue of black oppression and injustice to focus on broken windows and non-existent “fighting in the streets.” You have nothing productive, accurate, or nuanced to bring to conversation. Rather, you’re spewing lies and advancing anti-black talking points. Get the fuck off my post.",2020-07-27 16:45:25,19

comment,Rao is full of shit,"Christ you’re like an off brand Ben Shapiro. I’ll humor your reply one time for the benefit of anyone who might believe your bs. 1. One random fistfight in a city 200,000+ people does not equate to “people fighting in the streets.” 2. The windows a boarded but the business are all still open aside from a few that were looted on the 30th. 3. No one is against order coming back to the city, you idiot. People are upset that unmarked police vans were snatching people off the streets and holding them for 12+ hours without even charging them on the 31st. 4. Just to hammer my point home that Richmond isn’t “going to shit” and that you’re an idiot who has no idea what he’s talking about, here’s an article from the local news: [Police say Richmond riots were instigated by White Supremacists disguised as BLM](https://www.wsls.com/news/virginia/2020/07/27/police-richmond-riots-instigated-by-white-supremacists-disguised-as-black-lives-matter/) .

comment,Guys be careful with cheating on exams.,"Or cheating in general. Back when I was a TA I had to turn in people who plagiarized entire sections of their lab reports, thinking I wouldn't notice. Sometimes I caught lab reports that I had graded the year before being resubmitted. It's never pretty when someone gets kicked out of the university for cheating and burns years and tens of thousands of dollars just cause they couldn't be bothered to do an assignment. BTW careful of helping other people as well. Never give someone access to your work ""so they can take a quick look and get an idea where to start"" They will plagiarize your work and you will be in trouble yourself. The owner of the lab report I graded twice ended up having his grade retroactively changed to an F for sharing his work with his friend who submitted it with barely any changes.",2020-12-03 13:27:45,54

comment,Virginia Commonwealth University students walk out of graduation,"I graduated VCU this semester. At my department ceremony there were some people that wore some free Palestine stuff and they walked the stage and that was that. It was respectful and honestly, I feel, had a more positive impact and provided a greater effect than walking out. I think that it is a little extreme to walk out on the governor while they were giving a speech. Personally, I think people need to respect that a person was elected by people in this country and there is a reason why they were elected. You might not agree with the election but walking out disrespects more than just the person who is speaking. Yes, I would sit through a speech given by either Joe Biden and Donald Trump even though I think they both suck. Respect the position, not the person. Additionally, I am happy that the only thing that happened was they walked out.

post,Experience walking your animals on/ around campus?,"Experience walking your animals on/ around campus? Hey, I am quite curious about others experiences walking their animals on campus. Ive been attempting to walk my animals on campus, bit by bit. Ive been usually just walking him in between the Singleton and James music buildings and letting him get a feel for the outside. Friday, I was just letting him explore a bit and heard some students say that ""Oh, that cat is too skinny."" ""He looks like he doesnt eat at all."" Do others have the same negative experience as me, or is it both positive and negative? Im just really curious is all.",2025-09-21 12:00:59,143
comment,Experience walking your animals on/ around campus?,"I think one thing to consider is that most people’s cats are overweight. I’m don’t mean the 22lbs cats but a pound or two overweight. So when people see a cat at an actually healthy weight, they are thrown out of sorts and think the cat is skinny. Most people aren’t aware their cat or cats they know are overweight or they rationalize it by saying it’s only a pound or two. But when you are only supposed to weigh 7-12 pounds (this is generalization of cat weights) a pound over weight is a significant percentage of your body. I wouldn’t put too much concern to other people’s comments about your cat’s weight. If your vet says they are healthy, that is all the matters. Don’t worry so much about what other strangers think.",2025-09-21 12:10:41,55

comment,Experience walking your animals on/ around campus?,"Looks can be deceiving friend. My dog chooses not to eat until he wants to and people get worried they’re babysitting him. A shitzu has the same bite force as the 6inch tires on my skateboard, 150psi just for an example. Heck I don’t even say his full breed because it can be intimidating even though he’s thinks the world is all his friend so I get your concern Don’t worry about them, keep being an awesome cat parent because those random people don’t know anything about you or your cat. You obviously care enough to get them some exercise and stimulation in a really safe way and with that I can very highly assume you’re taking care of their food and basic needs (don’t make an ass of us both). Judgement sucks but the only judgement that matters in this situation imo is what the cat thinks of you and i get the feeling thats nothing but love, admiration and thankfulness that your their best friend",2025-09-21 12:33:01,8

comment,Experience walking your animals on/ around campus?,"First off: absolutely do not trust the opinions of students, they’re still learning. You might even encounter people that have never even seen a cat on a leash. In general, people at a university are often coming from places of great parental sheltering. Personally? I walked my dog a couple of times around campus and got totally mixed reactions. None that ever really stuck out or that I thought to internalize.

I think it really shows that you love and care for this cat if you bring the little guy out for walks. like others have been saying, looks can be deceiving. younger cats tend to be thinner anyway, so who are strangers to judge how healthy your cat is if they don’t know the age? i have cats myself and have many years of experience caring for them and this one looks totally healthy!",2025-09-27 11:57:30,2

comment,Experience walking your animals on/ around campus?,"I think maybe you should ask yourself what does their comment affect? Does it suddenly make your cat unhealthy? No. Does your cat’s feelings get hurt? No. Are they saying something that makes you unsafe? Not in this situation. Does it stop you from walking your cat? No. Does anything actually change because of their comment? No. There are lots of rude people in the world and if you let all of their opinions get to you, you are going to have a lot of hurt feelings. I don’t say that to be mean. But you will be a lot happy if you can get to a place where these strangers comments don’t affect you. It’s not always easy especially when people are mean. Yes there will be situations where strangers opinions do affect your ability to accomplish something and you should be aware of that. Maybe next time something like this happens ask yourself what changes in my life/friend’s life/situation/relationship etc. because of their comment? I’m not saying dismiss everything other people say, but the ability to critical think about what others say is important in many aspects of life.",2025-09-21 19:59:10,3

comment,VCU student death,Absolutely horrible and tragic. We lost a fellow Ram today and my heart goes out to his friends and family.,2021-04-06 15:56:14,43
comment,VCU student death,"Cody seemed to be an incredibly bright, kind young man with his entire life ahead of him and this is an absolute tragedy. I hate the fact that he came to Richmond for opportunity and to live his dreams out and this is how we respond. So many of our VCU students are from outside the city and they come here for the chance to experience at least moderately sized big city living and have to face crap they shouldn't. VCU students feeling safe needs to be a top priority and I don't really think it has been over the years, and that's an indictment on city leadership.",2021-04-07 02:31:12,21
comment,VCU student death,"RIP Cody. I didnt know you very well, but we had a few classes together over the years, and I considered you a friend. You were one of the few people I actively chose to sit next to, to talk to, to interact with, and you brought joy to everyone you were around. This whole thing has made me very sad, and I can only imagine what his close friends and family feel like. To them, I'm so sorry for your loss, and for the short time I knew him, he was a great friend and a great person. You deserved so much better, Cody. Rest in peace.",2021-04-07 02:47:03,19

comment,VCU student death,"For all of the folks worried about fear-mongering, it’s okay to be realistic, Richmond at the moment is not as safe as it was a few years ago. In the last year, crime has surged a ton around VCU - its people seeking opportunities out of accelerating wealth disparities. The pandemic has brought forth a lot of bad things, and an increase in crime is one of them. And rather than police reforming and listening to the needs of the city, they’ve just become a slightly less aggressive version of the status quo. Blame guns, unemployment, politics, a false sense of security, or whatever you want to blame. But at the end of the day, taking a life of another for anything other than self-defense is inexcusable, no matter the cause. People should be angry and look at this for exactly what it is, a travesty. I can only hope that something is done soon to bring back a little more peace and positivity to the area.",2021-04-06 16:46:20,51
comment,VCU student death,Hope they catch the guy. Richmond pd don’t seem to be too interested in catching these guys though. I got robbed one night by the race track. Had 4 guns to my head. Gave them the plate info for the car they were driving and didn’t catch them. The following night the same group of people robbed a bunch of student on campus and shot one in the leg. They ditched the jeep they were driving and fled on foot. They eventually caught the guy that stole the jeep but wouldn’t show any of the Robbery victims a picture so they could add the armed robbery charges. I was the 5th one they hit that night. Cops didn’t seem to want to do anything and their “suspects” turned up nothing,2021-04-07 05:57:02,9

comment,VCU student death,"It never hurts to use the RamSafe if you’re traveling far late at night. I have to use it regularly, and the only thing to remember is that after you get picked up, you might not necessarily be dropped off immediately—you may have to wait a moment while they go to other stops and drop off or pick up students.

comment,VCU student death,"It’s really not as dangerous as other cities, particularly with how gentrified VCU has made it.

My dad couldnt even called police as he had no phone back then and it would MINIMUM take 8-10 min for police to come,, my dad realized his life is in his own hands and he should not have to wait for police to protect his own life. There are horrible people out there that are willing to take your life, you carrying a gun and knowing when/when not to use it is so much better than relying when or if the police come when you need them.",2021-04-06 18:59:57,-9

post,"It's not GTA, stop driving like it","It's not GTA, stop driving like it I don't know if the driver who killed a student was from VCU, but even if they weren't, y'all actually need to chill the fuck out driving. Not trying to be *that guy* but lately a ton of people driving around campus have been going way too fast and even in the wrong directions. Almost got hit by a car TODAY because they were speeding through an alley and almost didn't see me in time, and almost got my car clocked in a parking garage because people were speeding in the actual garage. We all have places to be, but seriously, slow the hell down. Better to be late than on the phone with your insurance or talking to the police. Be careful out there",2023-01-27 17:07:08,132

comment,"It's not GTA, stop driving like it","I recently moved to richmond this month and one thing that always confused me was some of the traffic patterns and the pedestrian traffic lights in the city. Not sure how it works in the monroe campus, but at the MCV campus we have a crosswalk behind VCU hospital on marshall street, near Hunton's student center and VCU medical school. It takes such a long time for the pedestrian light to allow us to walk and the moment you even take a few steps on the street its counting down and the light is red before you cross 60% of the road. My classes are down that same street in Kontos and the Egyptian building. We have a second crosswalk there and there is even a sign that says traffic must yield to pedestrians. Every week I am crossing there I have to stop midway because I see a car that is clearly not going to stop for me and hit me if I keep walking. Most students and health workers have to pretty much jaywalk and there are so many times where my friends and I have to use that ""mom hand"" to make sure we don't get hit by a car that doesn't wait or is driving too fast. My roommate and I agreed to hold each other's hands like kindergartners crossing the street now. VCU gateway is literally a disaster waiting to happen. I'm afraid an mcv student or a professor will be running too late to an exam or lab and get hit by a car. Left turn yield on red. I am from chesterfield county. In that area, if you are making a left turn and the light is green for the left lane, every other traffic stops and the only ones that are moving are the people making a left turn. It takes longer to make a left turn in chesterfield but at least it is safer. In richmond, you could have a green light to turn left but you have to yield to opposing traffic, and the lane you are turning on, pedestrians may have the signal to cross the road. So not only you have to not get t-boned at the intersection, you have to make sure you don't hit a student crossing the road as well. I don't think every area in downtown has this, but its something I been running into later and I don't think its safe. Last night I was driving home from an event and I passed the area where the girl was hit. There was a crosswalk guard there. Did they wait until a student passed away before they put a crosswalk guard in a section where so many students cross the street to get to class or was that always there. There needs to always be a person there helping with traffic in certain areas around VCU. Its rush time, students are going class while workers are going to work so everyone is rushing and someone may not attention and get hurt or hurt someone. And to the person who hit that student. What The Hell?! How fast was this person going that she had to die?! Everyone needs to stop speeding. Maybe if that driver was driving slower that girl would have been injured, but still alive and recover. Its so depressing, she was a psychology major and was in her final year of undergrad. You guys please stay safe, drive carefully, and look both ways.",2023-01-28 13:27:24,6

post,Do VCU/RVA sidewalks bother you too?,"Do VCU/RVA sidewalks bother you too? Hello there guys! If you live around the VCU area or go to school here you know the sidewalks are terrible. Specially the brick ones, they are missing pieces and are the perfect recipe for twisting and ankle. A few weeks ago I twisted my ankle on one of these sidewalks. It was specifically the one on Cathedral PI. One of my classmates from my human design class brought up the idea to work on a project to hopefully get it fixed as soon as possible so it doesn’t pose anymore danger to the VCU community. I wanted to see if anyone else feels annoyed at the fact that these sidewalks are messed up or if anyone has ever been injured from one of these sidewalks. What are your thoughts? Would you guys be interested in getting the sidewalk fixed? Comment down any thoughts!",2023-09-18 12:39:03,127

But after I gained more confidence and a little time I really started to feel a lot more comfortable with it and started constructing some pretty outfits. I've been complimented a bunch wearing some fits and each time i still get that feeling that you felt. In short, keep rocking those outfits! 😌",2025-08-26 08:55:44,4

comment,"VCU fraternity is suspended four years for hazing, alcohol use","To side step the paywall, hit the reader button. Copy/pasted for your convenience: VCU fraternity is suspended four years for hazing, alcohol use Virginia Commonwealth University suspended a fraternity for four years over hazing and repeated alcohol violations. The suspension of Kappa Sigma occurred in May but was not previously reported. The fraternity is the third student organization to receive a multiyear suspension since the spring. After VCU increased its education and prevention efforts around hazing, university leaders expected students to report more violations, leading to more punishments, said university spokesperson Michael Porter. vcu campus icon Virginia Commonwealth University in May suspended Kappa Sigma for four years over hazing and repeated alcohol violations. The fraternity is the third student organization to receive a multiyear suspension since the spring. Mike Kropf, TIMES-DISPATCH Headquartered in Charlottesville, Kappa Sigma bills itself as the world’s largest college social fraternity with more than 200,000 members. The university initiated an investigation in January after someone reported an incident, according to the university’s website. VCU officials determined that in the spring of 2023, the fraternity required new members to clean cars of older members and line up to be quizzed by older members. People are also reading… A semester later, the group required new members to conduct daily weather reports, carry pledge packs, clean older brothers’ houses, deliver meals and perform calisthenics in a basement. Pledge packs often contain items fraternity brothers might want, such as cigarettes, snacks and medicine. Older students hazed new members by forcing them to consume milk and spicy food, Porter said. New members were interrogated in an intimidating or threatening manner, verbally abused and made to wear indecent clothing. In recent years, Kappa Sigma held four events with alcohol and served it to underage students, according to the university. At one party, a fight occurred, and a student had minor injuries. At another, police responded twice telling the students they were making too much noise. The university put sanctions on the group, but Kappa Sigma failed to comply with them, the university said. Last year, VCU placed the fraternity on deferred suspension, in which the organization was given the chance to follow school policy and avoid a harsher punishment. Having not met the school’s standard, Kappa Sigma was given a suspension in May that will lift in the spring of 2028. The fraternity’s national headquarters also suspended the chapter. Kappa Sigma, which did not respond to a request for comment, isn’t the only student group that received a long-term suspension in the spring. Pre-professional fraternity Delta Epsilon Mu was suspended for two years over psychological hazing, and sorority Phi Mu received a four-year penalty for buying and selling prescription pills on a student communication app. Another group, Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity, is on interim suspension while the university conducts its student behavior process. Eight VCU student groups have received multiyear sanctions since 2022. After VCU student Adam Oakes died in a hazing incident in 2021, state legislators passed a law requiring universities to publish the violations of student organizations, known as Adam’s Law. Now, student organizations are required to participate in in-person hazing-prevention training. Students also have a fuller understanding of what constitutes hazing, Porter said, leading them more often to report it. “It is a demonstration of the community’s growing unwillingness to tolerate behavior and to move toward culture change across all student organizations,” Porter added. Since the fall of 2023, 17 of VCU’s 480 student organizations violated the student code of conduct, including four for hazing, Porter said. Tracking the news What happened: Virginia Commonwealth University suspended the Kappa Sigma fraternity for four years. The background: The suspension was over hazing and repeated alcohol violations, VCU said. Kappa Sigma has more than 200,000 members. The other suspensions: It is the third student organization to receive a multiyear suspension since the spring.",2024-09-20 08:23:32,5
comment,"VCU fraternity is suspended four years for hazing, alcohol use","I was a pledge in fall of 2000, as a sophomore, to Pi Kapp. Two pledges had to go to the hospital with alcohol poisoning. Charter was revoked for a few years. Funny to see this, realize Pi Kappa Phi not only came back, but got kicked off campus again for the same thing two decades later, and had their whole charter revoked. FAFO I guess.

We have the expertise of a nationally premier health system, which has been on the front lines of this health crisis since the beginning, to assist us in our return. And, most importantly, we have trust in each other, recognizing that fostering a safe return to campus depends on our shared commitments. Are we doing in person?

They want to procreate. They use condoms to make bombs. Thats why they froze funds and when they realized the domino effect they fixed it, rather than ignoring and denying it. Idk about everyone else-but I like money, and I like to keep my money. I paid for my college myself, I will not pay for others who a contract to pay and now feel entitled to break a contract. Not ethical, and not a lesson to teach our youth. Besides-anyone with a worthy degree (not art history or Taylor swift studies) most companies offer loan reimbursements. Also, there’s financial aid for those on the lowest income levels. Loans mean your family makes enough money and they are willing to give you a loan. No credit checks, no questions asked. Of that want taxpayers to pay student loans then maybe change the process to procure a student loan. Credit checks? Or abide by the contract signed. Also-look at some of the studies being funded by funneling money. They give small animals cocaine and then study sex habits. And such nonsense. So everyone CHILL!!!! Let the governed shrink. Then those who truly need help-the funding will be available when the rot is gone. I was kicked off Medicaid and I was way under the limit. But non-taxing paying non-citizens have medical insurance. And my child is SSI disabled with a heart condition that causes SIDS. THEY DROPPED MY MEDICAID!!!! We pay taxes, we are under the limit by 20k and they can’t explain why I was taken off Medicaid. My daughter was refused. They let us have a plan eyes an 8k monthly amount we had to hit before they kick in. Our county is a business and this isn’t how a business is run.

comment,Did everyone at vcu get this email?,"The condom story was fact checked and that wasn’t true. Some organizations who get funded from the government send condoms to countries like Africa. Biden never sent 50 million dollars worth of condoms to Gaza. Medicaid expansion is available in 41states but not the rest. Not sure why Medicaid was To stop wasting money maybe start with the “pork” in all bills that all of Congress adds to. Yes, some research seems far fetched but taking money from public education for vouchers to charter or faith based schools is showing more of a scam than a help. Many of us agree there is government waste but actually look at where excessive spending is and how it affects the people. If you want to stop grants to universities fine, but the conditions of what a school teaches should not be up to the government. States control their own curriculums. If you don’t want to spend your money at that university; don’t. Changing history to reflect less embarrassment for white people is insane. Undocumented workers actually pay a lot in taxes. Many have ITIN numbers which pays into Medicare and Social Security that they can’t use. If they have health insurance, it is state funded. They can’t get Medicaid. The student loan debacle is a crisis with tuition increasing exorbitantly and wages not rising with it. Agree that students and parents need to stop looking at the “college experience” and maybe consider community college than transfer to 4 year college and everybody doesn’t have to go to an expensive, well known college for status.

If my son can fix any behavior issues by being in the back of the room and standing at a desk rather than sitting and it effects no one that should be okay, right. It solves many problems allowing him to stand. But if he does it then the other kids want to do it (5th grade) instead they want him medicated and sitting. Look I’m conflicted about Trump. Idk how I feel but something has to change and what we have been doing isn’t working. Federal govt wants meant to be this large. Medicaid is also state. In fact in Ny it’s county.

What many of you may not know, was that he had a dog named Bree at the time, a beagle that was a bit overweight from table scraps and loved to go on walks with her dad. Bree came into my family's possession because my stepmother was Dr. Brandt's nurse and nobody in the family wanted poor Bree. We loved her and gave her the best life she could have, but sadly, she was put down today as the vets found a tumor in her stomach after two days of not eating. On a hopeful note though, she is reunited with her wonderful owner and finally gets to run like the lively, young dog she once was.",2020-04-28 19:37:11,115

comment,Ouch! If cars have the green light... You Shall Not Pass!,"I don't agree. A couple of years ago 2 people lost their lives when they walked into traffic w/o having the right of way(if memory serves). After these deadly accidents VCU and/or the City of Richmond installed a series of speed humps in the most heavily trafficked areas in and around campus. Many of the traffic signals were programmed to include a 2-4 second gap between the walk sign and green lights, giving pedestrians time to begin crossing before drivers entered the intersections. VCU PD spent more time, especially at the start of semesters, on foot patrols at the busiest intersections, to educate pedestrians and enforce the rules. To anyone who watches that video it may cause them to be more mindful when moving around campus. If parents of students see the video it may cause some of them to plead with their student/ child to be more mindful. You are certainly right that perhaps no one will change anything about their behaviors, and there will still be terrible, deadly encounters. But taking prudent steps to influence the outcomes is a good idea.",2025-10-06 17:20:20,6

Try slowing TF down when approaching the humps, since that is the point. You might try reading about the differences between speed bumps and speed humps. I think a lot of vehicles would be turned to scrap if you drove over a speed bump at 35 mph. A speed hump is intended to be driven over, but at a lower, safer, speed.",2025-10-07 06:39:34,4

Most of the recent incidents involve pedestrians stepping into traffic and getting injured or killed. Then the response is always the same — more “traffic calming” measures and speed bumps. But if someone’s doing 55 mph down Campus Drive, lowering the speed limit isn’t going to change anything for those people. Honestly, having this on camera might at least show the folks who always demand someone “do something” about traffic that sometimes the issue isn’t the cars — it’s the common sense that was missing long before.

post,Been a student worker for 3 years — now they take away our breaks and send people home?,"Been a student worker for 3 years — now they take away our breaks and send people home? I took a photo of a sign that was posted on the office door. If this is my third year working here, why have they only now implemented this policy? I’m a student worker who does 8-hour shifts three days a week, on top of classes. So I can’t get a 15, just a 30. Students also aren’t allowed to join the workers’ union. Management regularly sends people home, which makes us short-staffed. I work at the restaurant that brings in the most customers and money on campus, so it’s confusing. Food rushes are stressful when you’re tired and can’t take a break because the managers sent five people home. I remember when I worked there my second year, one of the managers made me work in the kitchen by myself, just me and the cook. They left and said they would be right back, coming back 15 minutes later asking me why I had so many orders on the screen. Last year we brought in $4 million dollars in sales, one of the manager came to us excited. But what does that mean for us workers? This is the first year I haven’t gotten a 50 cent raise but a dollar raise. We aren’t allowed overtime anymore either. Last year I made 500 in one week from my overtime, this year it’s 270. Because this is my primary income, I cannot just quit like that. But I will start searching for jobs nearby that allows me to work early morning shift again.",2025-10-20 01:22:38,110

comment,Been a student worker for 3 years — now they take away our breaks and send people home?,"As far as I know this is unfortunately the Virginia law — I used to work at Target and they made clear that their break policy was mildly better than Virginia’s only because they follow national standards throughout the corporation (IIRC: four hours = a paid 15, 6 hours = a paid 15 and unpaid 30, over 6 hours = 2 paid 15s and 1 unpaid 30 … if anyone else has worked at a VA target correct me if I’m wrong it’s been a year). But (again, IIRC) they were clear that it was above the Virginia policy. I’m a student worker too, although I don’t work in a restaurant. Our policy is also that over 6 hours gets you a 30. No 15s. For me, I’m working at a desk and I spend most of my time doing homework anyway, so it’s not a problem at all. But in a high stress kitchen environment (especially one as busy as you describe, I’m presuming CFA lol) 6 hours without any break at all is unreasonable. A google search tells me VA doesn’t actually require meal breaks to be provided to anyone over 16 — it’s the employer’s choice. But still, a manager/employer who doesn’t allow their employee a break, especially in an environment like that, is straight up asking for mutiny and discontent.

comment,Who else is ready for the return to campus?,"Just giving ya a hard time ;) That CBRN is more then satisfactory for most chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear protection. There are a couple of things that they don't do well with, such as acid gases (I think they are good for about 30 min) and a few of the nastier chemical agents that the substrate can't filter out. The only reason mask/filter combos like that don't cut it in the infectious disease labs is OSHA generally require PAPR because they supply positive pressure to the mask. With positive pressure, that all but eliminates any potential of contaminates entering the mask if it is not fitted right by blowing air away from the user. I had to learn about all this crap some time ago and was well prepared when things went sideways last year as I had a bunch of Mine Safety Appliances (MSA) stuff (gave a bunch of it away too) Where did you get the Russian filter?

comment,Who else is ready for the return to campus?,"Word. The Russians made millions of those things during the cold war and while they technically have an expiration date, they really can last for decades. He told me what they did with the old ones is periodically grab several from a batch and test them, and if they passed simply recertify the lot. In case you don't know, the simple way to make sure the mask fits correctly is to put it on and cover the hole on the filter and breath in, holding a vacuum. If you hear or feel any air passing through or the vacuum breaks you have a leak and need to adjust the straps (unless it's somewhere else other than the face seal) If that's good then cover the exhalation valve and breath out, again if the pressure equalizes or you hear or feel something you need to adjust the mask.

post,Everything I Wish I Knew And Did During Undergrad at VCU,"Everything I Wish I Knew And Did During Undergrad at VCU After being a member on here for some time, and seeing a lot of the posts and comments on here, I wanted to share some things I’ve observed and reflected on during my time at VCU that might be beneficial to some of you just starting your college tenure. A lot of this pertains to life after college, and to maximize your earning potentials and job satisfaction later on in life, planning and preparation is so crucial (I really cannot stress this enough). 1) First and foremost, I don’t care what people say, GRADES MATTER! Not all employers ask for your gpa, but in my experience, the overwhelming majority do. Strive for a 3.3+. If you can get a 3.5+, the number of doors that open up to you can be incredible. There’s so much competition these days that even though employers know that gpa hardly means shit, they will still go for someone with a 3.5 over the 3.0 all else disregarded. 2) Get an internship ASAP! This means start looking your sophomore year at the latest. Your not screwed as a junior, but every subsequent year gets harder and harder. GO TO CAREER SERVICES AND ASK FOR JORGE PIOCUDA! He is one of the greatest assets VCU employs. Seriously! That man is amazing! Work on your resume with him, how to make yourself marketable even as an underclass, and how to write cover letters. 3) I’m a STEM student so this one might not be relevant to everyone, but for those of you in STEM, learn some technical skills! Obviously coding will be the main one for many of you. You should also be familiar with Excel (as well as most MS applications) and SQL..you’d be surprised at how many STEM related jobs utilize this tools and this can give you serious advantage if your moderately good with then. 4) Networking. The big one. This is arguably the most important aspect of college. So many people graduate and still have no clue what this means for a student. Well, it means going to class, forming relationship with your academic advisor and most importantly with your teachers! Form relationships with them! Ask for 1v1 meetings, do really well on your assignments, come prepared, ask questions in class, ask questions outside of class, and have them recognize you and your name! I’ve had professors reach out to me (and the entire class at times) with really cool job opportunities that I really wish I had capitalized on, but because I was a lazy shit, I knew they weren’t going to recommend me for that role. Fortunately I did get lucky, but please, get to know your professors. Go to career fairs! A lot of the jobs were kinda ehhh but speaking with some of the recruiters at the fair can open some really interesting opportunities. 5) Get involved on campus. Leadership position matter. Doesn’t matter what, employers want to see that your personable, you can manage, you can work within organizations, and are a natural leader. They eat that shit up. The more it pertains to your desired profession, even better—but not entirely necessary. If you can do all these things while in undergrad I promise your journey will be much easier. Ultimately, college is supposed to prepare you for the jobs you want when you graduate. Unfortunately, the job market is so oversaturated that more than a degree is necessary to get that job. If you want that job with a competitive salary in a great work environment, best believe you’ll need to work your ass off for it. Perfect that resume, build those connections, hone in on your interviewing skills and grab your career by the horns! Good luck guys!! Edit: Thanks for all the wonderful comments and inputs, guys! I hope for the best for all of you! Also, thank you to the kind person who gave me an award :) I’ve never gotten one before and it feels very nice! One last thing I wanted to mention, because it’s something I regret soooo much, if you get the opportunity to study abroad, take it! Some of my friends and siblings did, an d they say it’s one of the greatest experiences they’ve ever had. If you’re already paying tuition, it doesn’t cost much extra to do a semester abroad, and it can be a life changing experience. Also it can look really good on resumes as well :)",2021-01-28 00:30:39,107

comment,Everything I Wish I Knew And Did During Undergrad at VCU,"I disagree with the high GPA matters thing, unless you have it that is amazing. But I don't think its the end all, be all. I don't want to be rude (this is coming from a stem major, and a 3.5+GPA), but don't beat yourself up, especially in this stressful time. People with a high GPA really see that benefit if they are pre-med, or applying to a competitive school after their bs degree (like PA school or grad programs in general). If you are entering the workforce after your degree, I doubt your GPA (unless extremely low/depends on major avg/job pool avg) will be the ultimate deciding factor in getting whatever position. Someone more well rounded, either with work experience/leadership skills/etc are not always someone with a high GPA. Tbh GPA is just a piece of the pie, many factors will be considered, I don't mean to be rude, this is coming from someone who ONLY obsessed over grades, I only learned the importance of networking and internships when I transfer to VCU (junior year).

comment,Everything I Wish I Knew And Did During Undergrad at VCU,"I'd like to echo points 4 & 5. As a studyholic who got a 3.9 GPA, I've found that my lack of networking and internship experience really harmed my career opportunities. The 3.9 gpa is a great thing to fall back on, as I have an abundance of grad school options, and low-level administrative support jobs are easily impressed by it, but it alone won't get you that career job. Other insights I'd add: (1) get as fit as you can, (2) make sure you pick a job you want, not a major, (3) date and socialize as much as you can, it will never get easier than in college (dating in college is literally as easy as going up to any person you're interested in and starting a convo, or just sitting next to someone in class and asking to studying together), (4) take the best job opportunity you can find out of college, no matter where it takes you (within reason).

comment,Everything I Wish I Knew And Did During Undergrad at VCU,"Speaking from a School of Business/Finance perspective, this is a great list. Networking and getting involved are super important. The professors, especially some of the adjuncts, know people in the industry. If you can form a relationship with them and they think your smart/capable/etc they can connect you with people to get you the jobs you want. Getting involved is also a great place to make friends and network with other driven folks. These are people that are going to be pushing themselves, so having connections with these people is a great way to keep your career moving after you land that first job. Not to mention having lifelong friends is pretty dope too.",2021-01-28 19:56:16,2

comment,Everything I Wish I Knew And Did During Undergrad at VCU,"I agree with everything you wrote. Most, if not all forms of applications are reviewed holistically. That is, no single feature will make or break you, unless your on the extreme end of the spectrum (e.g. <2.0 gpa or invented Facebook). From my personal experience, about 30% of all the applications I thought about applying to/ or applied to, required a 3.0 minimum gpa. Some never stated, and I was asked during interviews (rare, but it happened). In the end, it matters a lot for some people, and less so for others. You don’t always know, until you’ve come out the other side of the process, so I advise making your life easier, and strive for a good gpa. So much less stress. The average application, IIRC, has about 200 applications. They will obviously choose the best fit, and the one with the best credentials (assuming your applying on LinkedIn, Indeed, Glassdoor, etc.). If your under a 3.0, getting a job without much else going for you will be extremely hard. Below that, and a non-stem degree? Very very hard. 100% agree with being well rounded. That was really the main heart of my tips. Work on making yourself employable. For example, an Econ major, with a 3.1 gpa, 1 summer internship, fluent in Spanish and English, some basic excel skills and no criminal background (and maybe a clean credit score) from an average school is a very well rounded candidate. A physical major with a 3.5 gpa and nothing else could very well struggle.",2021-01-28 20:34:16,2

post,To college students who are bashing service members;,"To college students who are bashing service members; To my fellow students, It’s easy, especially in academic spaces, to view military service through the lens of policy critiques, imperialism, or historical injustice. These are valid and necessary conversations. But in the process, let’s not lose sight of the people behind the uniform—individuals who often come from working-class backgrounds, communities of color, or underserved areas. Many enlist not out of blind nationalism, but out of economic necessity, a desire to serve, or a hope for education and stability. Criticize the wars, challenge the policies, question the system—that’s our right and responsibility. But don’t dehumanize the individuals who bear the physical and emotional costs of those decisions. Veterans and active-duty service members are not monoliths; many return home disillusioned, become activists, or speak out against the very institutions they once served. They, too, deserve respect, support, and the freedom to be heard without being reduced to caricatures. You can oppose the war machine and still honor those who’ve walked through it.",2025-06-12 00:47:48,105

comment,To college students who are bashing service members;,"Thanks for taking the time to write this out. I really appreciate the thought you put into it, and I wanted to share a few things I’ve been thinking about too. I’m not trying to argue just to argue — I’m genuinely curious about your take on some of this. 1. I totally get that a lot of people join the military out of economic necessity or to try and build a better life. I teach high school, and a number of my students have enlisted for those exact reasons. I respect that deeply. At the same time, I think there’s a difference between supporting veterans as human beings and unintentionally helping prop up the war machine. The military often uses those personal stories to paint itself in a heroic light — but those stories can be used to recruit more vulnerable people into a system that doesn’t always serve them well once they’re out. Supporting access to healthcare, education, housing — all of that is important. But I think we have to be honest about how often the *narrative* around “supporting the troops” gets used to silence critique. 2. I’m also struggling with the idea of separating policy critiques and historical injustice from the military itself. Like — how could we, really? Since WWII, the U.S. military has caused huge civilian death tolls in places like Vietnam and Iraq, overthrown democratically elected leaders, and left chaos in its wake (Grenada, Chile, Iran, etc.). A lot of times, it *is* the troops who carry those actions out, whether they agree with the mission or not. That doesn’t mean I blame every individual soldier — but we also can’t ignore the fact that they’re part of the force that carries out U.S. imperial policy. That’s a hard thing to contend with, but it feels important. As a domestic example, should we celebrate the US forces who opened fire on, and killed, student protestors at Kent State? Respectfully, I think the victims narrative is more relevant than the solder / guardsmen who was ""only following orders/"" So yeah, I guess I’m wondering — how do we support people who serve without reinforcing the system itself? And how do we stay honest about what the military does, without reducing everyone in uniform to a stereotype, good or bad? Would genuinely love to hear your thoughts on that.",2025-06-13 13:22:25,1

One thing you have to remember is that they just cannot disobey an order given to them by their superior. I remember when my first husband was a soldier, he had a wife and family a baby. He couldn't just disobey an order and then be court-martialed. So many of these people are young and they enlisted when there was no war and they volunteered to protect our country. At any moment they could have to go to war so we need to support the service members. If you want to do something make sure you vote in the next election. You live in Virginia? We have our midterms in November 2026. We need you to get out there and vote because we're voting for our governor. Every member of the Senate and House in Virginia is up for reelection. You need to be active in the voting process because your vote is power. The people who voted for the orange felon and the people who did not vote for him all voted for him. Yes the people who did not vote, who did not think their country was important, voted for Trump indirectly. You need to take action and in fact on June 14th you can participate in a rally which there are about over 1,500 rallies to voice your opinion that you aren't happy with this Administration. Go to no kings.org and sign up for a rally near you on Saturday. So please stop bashing the military members who are protecting our country and protecting you.",2025-06-12 11:37:01,-1

A lot of service members who are doing this *are* immigrants themselves too, which is even more shocking and heinous to think that they’re doing this to their own communities.

post,Nobody notices the professor's thick accent until after they fail the midterm. Nobody wants study material until the week of the exam. But they can bully the professor into giving them better grades. I kind of have a problem with that.,"Nobody notices the professor's thick accent until after they fail the midterm. Nobody wants study material until the week of the exam. But they can bully the professor into giving them better grades. I kind of have a problem with that. I'm not sure how to feel about getting a curved grade. It highlights a double standard in this institution. During my first year I took an intersession course and went to the dean after a professor deducted points from one of my already graded assignments with the comment ""A's in this class must be earned"". The professor just didn't like me and had commented on my appearance multiple times. It was well-documented and I got an 89%, 'B' in the class, for no reason. This semester, our entire \*\*\*\* class failed the exam. I did badly on this exam too. It's kind of a bad class but it was outlined in the syllabus. (No one to blame but yourself). There's a lot of information that's not covered in his two-minute lecture videos. We use multiple textbooks. It requires more work from the students. I just watched students in this class not take notes; not study; cheat on their Homework; and then they cry to the dean after they failed. They didn't even have to cry with supporting documentation to prove that they worked hard in this class. Their engagement isn't being assessed like mine was. They didn't have to make a case. (and they really don't have one) Then, the professor just gives us all grades we didn't earn. (a 70-point curve) I'm in a groupchat with these people. I know how much nothing they did. The main complainers didn't even buy the book and their answer to everything is ""I just looked it up on quizlet"" or chatgpt Nobody notices the professor's thick accent until after they fail the midterm.

comment,It’s truly impressive how much worse the new version of Degree Works is compared to the last version.,"Advisor here. I absolutely hate the new version of both DegreeWorks and Banner (for course registration) and really miss the old versions. However, VCU doesn’t have control over whether their external venders choose to “update” their products, even if the updates end up being terrible. So this isn’t a case of VCU trying to make things annoying for everyone; this is happening because these companies that we are under contract with are releasing new (worse) versions of their products. For those of you not able to see secondary majors, etc. on the new DegreeWorks, this may just be a glitch (in which case your advisor can ask another office to attempt to fix it for you). Otherwise- especially if you are earning two completely different degrees (example 1- a B.S. in Chemistry and a B.F.A. in Comm Arts; example 2- a bachelor’s degree and a master’s degree)- you need to go to the drop down menu that says “Degree” (top right of your DegreeWorks page) and select your other degree in order to view it. If you are a double major but both degrees are the same type (example- B.S. in Chemisty and B.S. in Biology), you should be able to view both of your majors on the same page. If not, something is wrong and you should contact your advisor to troubleshoot.",2021-01-14 08:41:07,7

post,PSA for incoming freshman and transfer students,"PSA for incoming freshman and transfer students To all incoming freshman and transfer students, welcome to VCU. While we are excited to have you here, we just want to let you in on a couple things. VCU has some of the highest queer, trans, POC, Muslim, Jewish, disabled, neurodivergent, international, and first generation student and faculty populations in the state, and maybe even the country. We are defined by our diversity, we would not be VCU without it. If you are willing to embrace our diverse and inclusive culture, then we are excited to see you in the Fall. *However,* if people with the identities and backgrounds mentioned above make you uncomfortable in any way, then you have two options: 1. Learn to become accepting of those who are different from you 2. Withdraw your application from VCU No matter how you may feel or what the government might try to do to us, we are never going away, and we will never stop being proud of who we are. Period point blank. Thank you for reading this, and we look forward to welcoming you soon 💛",2025-07-02 20:24:51,103

post,Just learned some interesting history about the Altria Theater I wanted to share with y'all. It's not that important though.,"Just learned some interesting history about the Altria Theater I wanted to share with y'all. It's not that important though. So first things first, if anyone has told you it used to be a mosque, they are wrong. It was built by a group of shriners (who don't have anything to do with islam) in 1927 and they called it ""The Mosque"" but it was never used for worship. They mainly used it as a theatre and a meeting place but it had all types of fun shit. A swimming pool, bowling alleys, pool tables, you name it they had it. Then in the 40's they had to sell if because it lost a lot of money due to the great depression. They sold it to the city for $200,000 when it cost them over $1.6 million to build it. Parts of it were used by the police. They used the lower floors as a police academy and even had a shooting range in it. During that time however, they still kept the name and continued to use it as an entertainment venue. They even had a rule where they couldn't use the firing range while a show was going on. It's worth mentioning that while film was shown in the theater it was mainly used for concerts and plays. It was so large and popular they had people like Elvis, Jimi Hendrix, and Frank Sinatra play in it. Then in 1994 its name was changed to Landmark Theater after a petition by a local muslim group who claimed the name ""Mosque"" was inappropriate for a place of entertainment. In 2014 after a $10 million renovation gift by the Altria Group, a tobacco corporation, it was renamed to... to... damn it I forgot what they renamed it to.",2020-10-01 23:52:27,102
comment,Just learned some interesting history about the Altria Theater I wanted to share with y'all. It's not that important though.,"The reason it was referred to as ""The Mosque,"" and still is by folks who have been around long enough, had to do with the architectural styles that were incorporated into it.

post,Strange things happening in Rhoads,"Strange things happening in Rhoads Hey there guys I have been loving my first year at VCU so far, even with all this COVID stuff going on, but as much as I love it there has been something strange going on in Rhoads and I was hoping other people have had similar experiences in this building and its not just me. It all started I think my first week here, I was finishing up some homework late into the night and I had to use the bathroom. As I went into the floor bathroom I could tell something was different. I just had a bad feeling but I had to get my business done so I could finish my homework for the night so I sucked it up and went into the stall anyways. I'd say about a minute in is when I felt it, a strange cupping sensation on my balls. It felt like they were being fondled by a ghost which is where I came up with the name for the ghost, the ball fondling ghost (because it fondles balls), I was so freaked out I pushed the last dookie out my ass and I rushed back to my dorm and didn't even bother to finish my homework because I was so freaked out by the whole experience. I thought it was a one time thing but this has happened about every 3 days or so and its really starting to freak me out. But also at the same time I appreciate the ball fondling ghost's company on these lonely COVID nights :( Anyways, I was hoping anyone else who lives or used to live in the building has had an encounter with the ball fondling ghost so I know it's not just in my head.

Basically, after multiple consecutive nights of similar complaints VCUPD showed up and the guy ran out of the bathroom and made a mad rush for their balls and so they turned him into Swiss cheese. I wasn’t there for it but I definitely ran down to check it out after I heard all the shots.

I used to fuck an RA there & she told me there’s been more than a few suicides in Brandt/Rhoads. There have been a shit ton in Johnson.

The elevators were wildly unpredictable as well, I was on the 18th floor and the amount of times it went all the way to the 17th just to go down... There was a girl on my floor that year who said she had a Confederate soldier following her around that she picked up off a battlefield and got possessed by for a bit. She proved it by holding a necklace still and asking questions, then clockwise would be one answer and counterclockwise another I think? So yeah. Richmond in general is haunted as fuck, though, I wouldn't worry about it too much except for maybe trying to get some sleep instead of being violated by the dead.

post,got spiked and ra’s found out,"got spiked and ra’s found out so i was at a house party. typically i just ask for soda and thats what they give me. yesterday I got spiked, i asked for sprite, had 2 cups. it tasted a bit bitter but not too much so didn’t think much of it. after 30 mins i began feeling incredibly lightheaded, dizzy, and nauseas. my vision began going out. my friends got me out of the house, and took me home. I live in vcu housing, and while going up the elevator, we ran into 2 ra’s. they came to our room to check in and make sure everything was fine. they took my name and v# and said they would be reporting it to upper housing. i’m really scared. i don’t want criminal charges or anything, especially since i wasn’t even trying to drink. does anyone know what would happen? edit- they didn’t call cops or do any tests so not sure how much/what i had okay so update as of oct 1- i initially had a meeting with the conduct office and they gave me 1yr disciplinary probation. a week later i got another email saying they wanted to talk again, and the charges had been dropped. basically they asked about the party, where it was, who threw it (rose club apparently). they said there’s not much they can do abt rose since they aren’t associated with vcu, but told me that they would keep what id said in their records and try to gain more info on rose but basically nothing they can do rn. anyways im good.",2025-08-24 15:51:20,96
comment,got spiked and ra’s found out,"I think you should be more concerned about being drugged.

comment,got spiked and ra’s found out,Nothing bad is going to happen! reporting something doesn’t necessarily mean something bad is going to happen.

comment,got spiked and ra’s found out,"Hi, former VCU RA here. You should be fine. Freshmen are drunk and stoned all the time and, unless things have changed since I graduated, RAs couldn't give less of a shit. In your situation, it sounds like you were unable to get to your own room under your own power. That is probably why the on-duty RAs checked up on you. They are very aware that people get wasted. But there is a line. If I saw someone who looked spiked being escorted to a room, I would be concerned. As far as the report, RAs have to submit anything suspicious on-duty. If you mentioned being spiked, they can report it so that an investigation can occur to make sure that you are okay. They might ask what party it occurred at because it's very likely you weren't the only one that night.",2025-08-24 19:12:28,17

comment,got spiked and ra’s found out,"Your friends should have taken you to the hospital, I assume the campus has one, then called the local city police. That heavy breathing was a concern, that's not normal for being wasted. I work for University for 35 years here's some advice. Do not report it to the campus police, any kind of an assault and in this case I think you were drugged, it needs to be reported to the local police. Where I work the campus police were actually sworn officers to the town. They work for the University and the university will cover it up. Image is everything to the university, it's how they get donations, it's how they get students because it is a safe campus statistically, they will sell you out, for money. If the campus police are sworn officers they are the leads in the case, because you reported it to them first. As for the RAs forget about them, they have zero proof because no blood test was taken, as far as that concern, you could have eaten some bad clams, seafood that tasted funny, got sick felt dizzy starting to vomit. You're actually very lucky. You need to be careful don't trust anyone handing you an open drink. Oh, someone should have stayed with you during the night, people have died drugged and vomiting, not waking up.",2025-08-25 01:44:30,2

comment,got spiked and ra’s found out,"This victim blaming attitude is exactly why op is worried. I drink in private, but I refuse a sip of alcohol at parties or other outings. The environment gives me the buzz without any needed substance. House parties are commonly known for people getting roofied. That's why I stopped going and I only go to events at secure locations and only drink form sealed bottles. Op. My advice is to write down everything from that night down. Who gave you the drinks, what you were told was in them, how long you didnt have your sight on them, etc. And if they question you, do not let them pressure you into saying you did something you didnt. You went to a party off campus. Nothing wrong with that. You did NOT consume any substances. Nothing wrong with that. You were roofied or spiked without your consent. They cannot prove otherwise because you did not do otherwise.

comment,Wow,"Just to note, I’m not complaining about the water problem, but more VCU’s handling of the return to campus. We originally were meant to have 3 days for all 4500 freshmen and additional upperclassmen to return to campus before classes start. That was sufficient time for everyone to get back to campus and settle down before the new semester. Now that’s been forced all into 1 day on Sunday, and with snow falling across the entire state, many people may have to drive through dangerous roads to return to campus. By forcing this instead of giving students an extra day to return, VCU puts students at risk during their return to campus and will also lead to a hectic move in day for students as everyone tries to move back into their dorms. That or many people may miss their first day or two of classes due to not having the time or good road conditions to make it.",2025-01-10 22:22:28,14

post,Why I haven't been doing the covid numbers recently.,"Why I haven't been doing the covid numbers recently. If y'all haven't noticed, I have not been posting any updates regarding vcu's covid numbers recently. Honestly, I just got sick of it. As people did point out, unlike the first few weeks when we got here, not much has happened recently so I really could not think of any substantial things to add to the update daily. This made my updates a bit stale. Not to mention, some people seemed to dislike me posting in the first place for that exact reason. As such, I really don't wanna do the updates anymore. If anyone wants to do it themselves, feel free. All I ask is that you allow the comments to be a place where people can talk about their ideas about what is going on. On a final, positive note: we finally have the amount of tests VCU is doing and has done. I sincerely thank all of you who sent emails to get that added, you've done a great deal for us rams :). I'd consider my purpose in posting the updates to be fulfilled and my main goal of getting the actual numbers up done. I couldn't have done it without you guys; Thank You 😁.

And when I come home I don’t like my outside clothes on my bed or couch esp after a day at the library. The lib is where I spend most of my time. Students should definitely use it.

That's very disheartening. What they both still have, at least for now, are jobs in their STEM fields that support them. They have their education. They have their achievements. They have the ability to diversify. Life will throw curve balls, and most paths to success are not linear. When the time comes, get the internships to gain experience (paid or not). Go to the job fairs and hand out your resume. Private industry is always looking for STEM professionals. It's the experience you have to bring to the table. Getting experience can be slow, messy, boring, challenging, satisfying, surprising or exciting. It's all those things. Put your energy into your passion, and search until you find the thing for you.

post,"100 pieces of candid advice about VCU, college, & life from an alumni who had to learn the hard way","100 pieces of candid advice about VCU, college, & life from an alumni who had to learn the hard way **Preface** I graduated in the late 2010s. I have a younger family member going to VCU soon, so I decided to write up advice for him that I ended up just making general advice for anyone coming here. I thought it’d be a good idea to post them here in case they can add any value to any current/future student's lives. This post isn’t a victory lap about how I succeeded in college, it’s lots of hard lessons I learned as a first-generation college student who had no role model for how to set myself up to achieve long-run success during college, and despite having good intentions ended up making a lot of bad decisions that led to (currently) having a mediocre career, limited social life, and poor mental/physical health. I also learned a lot from watching the successes and failures of my friends. Posting in the hopes that people who read this don’t make the same mistakes and be stuck in their mid/late 20s having to put their life together (it’s so much harder now than it is in college when you actually have free time). I’m sure some of the points will be universally agreeable, and others will be hotly debated. This is just my very biased point of view, take everything with a grain of salt, and take in the opinions of others with an open ear. I felt writing this really gave me a lot of closure surrounding the lingering regret I had from my college days. I hope you all enjoy reading it as much as I did writing it. **Health/Mindset** 1. Mental health is the most important thing. Fix it ASAP. University Counseling Services is a great resource (might’ve saved my life when I was having a panic attack my junior year), make use of it. Don’t be ashamed to get therapy, it’s literally the best thing you can do for yourself. 2. Physical health is a close second. Cary Street Gym is amazing (the indoor track is goated). Find a buddy and start hitting the gym. Focus on cardio and calorie counting if you are overweight, focus on weight lifting and refining your diet if you’re normal size/skinny. I can not stress to you enough how difficult physical health is to fix once you’ve got a 40-hour-a-week job, make use of your abundance of free time in college to form long-term gym and eating habits. 3. Your mindset should be that you’re here to meet as many people as possible and take advantage of the 4 most fun and social years of your life. Your routine should be very public. You don’t meet people or get opportunities chilling in your dorm with one friend playing games all day. Studying at the library will get you more opportunities than studying at the dorm. Hell watching Netflix in the Commons will get you more social opportunities than watching it in your dorm. Getting out the house is a must. 4. Actively seek discomfort, it’s the only way you grow. 5. Challenge the beliefs your parents instilled in you. I came into college a Conservative Christian sexist/basically incel who loved conspiracy theories and racist jokes. I left a Liberal-leaning person questioning his religion, with more classy interests and a respect for women. Not saying become a liberal atheist, I’m saying challenge your beliefs to see if you actually believe them. I built my whole social life in college around being Christian and it had profound social ramifications on me when I started to question my faith… my college experience would’ve been so much more congruent with who I am if I had come to these conclusions my Freshman year rather than my Senior year. 6. Delete your video games during the semester. People who level up online don’t level up irl. 7. If college feels easy for you (it did for me), you aren’t challenging yourself enough and need to add on things **Choosing a major/career** 8. Evaluate if college is even the right path for you. It’s expensive and time-consuming, and you do not want to go to school and drown yourself in debt and not get a job making enough to pay it off. Ask yourself what sort of job/life you want and if college can realistically get you that. Ask if that dream job pays well enough to reach your long-term lifestyle goal. DO NOT come to college if you have no specific answer to the question: “what’s your goal in coming to college?” And the answer can’t be “I’m just figuring it”… go figure yourself out somewhere you aren’t going into massive debt and come to college when you do (if that’s the right path). 9. It’s completely ok to put off college for a few years after high school to soul search. Coming in with the right major/career path in mind will make the time off worthwhile. 10. Have an idea what job you want to get with your major. I used to say “pick a job, not a major” but I actually prefer to advise picking between a shortlist of majors with good stats and then back engineering that to a job. The exception being if you have a very strong passion for a certain career path and the academic strength and discipline to distinguish yourself in that path. 11. Ideally, study a Technology, Engineering, or Math major if you are capable. These are far and away the best majors for long-term financial success and work-life balance. Not all these degrees are created equally either, I know BME for example is generally pretty bad for an engineering major. 12. Finance/Accounting and majors leading to a Health field career are good too, though I’d call them second tier. 13. If you want to study anything else, make a damn good plan about what job you’ll get, what additional education/experience you will need, what grades you’ll need, etc. Fields like Psychology, Mass Communication, Marketing, Criminal Justice, Education, Art, HPEX, anything Liberal Arts (these are a slight exception because they develop good long-run skills), Political Science, Sociology, etc… lead to poor on-average job prospects because they are extremely interesting fields and hence popular. You basically have to compete twice as hard for half the pay compared to the fields mentioned above. **If it’s truly your calling then go for it, I’m not here to completely crush dreams**, just really think hard about whether it’s a calling so strong that you’ll turn down less cutthroat competitive fields that lead to much more stable and predictable financial outcomes for future you. I just know some people who studied these fields who can’t even get an entry-level job making more than they could’ve made without a degree and it’s incredibly sad considering how much debt they went into and how hard they worked. *There’s always the option of double majoring in one of these and something TEM/Finance/Health. That way you get the passion + the fallback financial plan.* 14. STEM is a dumb acronym because Science major's stats are heavily inflated by people who go on to any form of professional or grad school. As just an undergrad degree it’s extremely mid. These are great for preparing you for more school, but if you want a job out of undergrad, study something else. 15. Don’t be pre-med unless you are an exceptional student who truly feels a deep unwavering calling to medicine. I met an insane number of freshmen/sophomores who were pre-med even though it was obvious to any third party observing them that they had 0 chance of ever making it in this cutthroat competitive path, and somebody needs to tell them to stop wasting their time on an impossible dream and be practical. If you aren’t ready to hold a 3.8, volunteer, scribe, work as an emt, and research, all while studying for the MCAT in the background, then this isn’t that path for you. Even one of my most intelligent and hard-working friends has had to fight his ass off 3 cycles just to get a shot at getting into med school before his 27th birthday. Most people (myself included) are not smart and disciplined enough for this path. And most who are could make similar amounts of money with less debt and better work-life balance in other fields. So unless you feel a deep unwavering calling towards the career path, do something else. Don’t just do it because mom and dad pushed you. There are so many great health career fields that don’t involve going $400,000 into debt and being a student for 11 years after high school (PA, nurse, pharmacist, etc…) 16. Don’t be Pre-Law either. It’s another all-consuming path of high debt, poor job satisfaction, and hyper-competitiveness. 17. If your major isn’t working out, the sooner you change it the better. Don’t be afraid to admit failure and find a path you can succeed in. Or even drop out and find a completely alternative path. Be honest with yourself about how you are doing in your field and pivot if the answer is bad and you can’t fix it by working harder alone. **Academics** 18. GPA isn’t everything. It opens the door to good internships and scholarships, but past that it’s low-key useless. My 3.9 got me nowhere, my friends with more well-rounded resumes outran me in the long-run. Extracurriculars and work experience matter so much more for securing a nice job. Don’t get tunnel vision for grades, there is so much more in college. 19. VCU Academic Advisors are (generally) mediocre. Use bulletin to get a good idea of what courses you need to take and which ones to take each semester (you could make a 4-year plan and run it by a trusted older student in your major… that would be a million times better than asking advisors who don’t know shit and don’t have the nuanced knowledge of your specific field. 20. Scope out your profs on RateMyProfessor. No sense taking a course with an asshole who grades hard when you can avoid it. 21. Go to class, even if lectures are an idiotic way to learn in the 21st century. The value of going to class isn’t learning the material, you do that when you study. The value is meeting the people in class, and more importantly: the professors. Professors are generally former industry professionals with insane networks. Get to know them, they're a golden resource to your career. 22. Office hours are an even better way to network with your professor and get them to go easy on grading you 23. Learn how to learn efficiently. I wasted a lot of time overstudying inefficiently. Seek Academic Coaching (this is a thing at VCU) if you need it and watch some YouTube videos on the science of learning. 24. Frontload your semesters. The harder you work the first few months, the easier life will be the rest of the semester. Do all the assignments and extra credits well and ace the first exam and suddenly your set up to be able to do b/c grade work the rest of the semester and still get an A. 25. Track your grades for classes on spreadsheets so you know where you are at and what you need to do to get to your target goals. Professors give the weight of each assignment/test on the syllabus and it’s really easy to plug them into excel and keep track as you go and back engineer what you’ll need on x exam for y grade. 26. It’s ok to plan in advance to just get a B or C in some classes. Prioritize your focus on classes where marginal effort can push you from one grade to the next… choosing to just get a C in your hardest class so you can get As in the rest would still get you a 3.6 for the semester. Raising 3 87s to 90s through marginal effort is better for your GPA than raising one C to an A through insane effort, and letting those 3 87s stay as Bs. 27. Keep a calendar and stay organized. Denote major deadlines on the calendar. Don’t try to plan every second of your day though, just set aside time for the important stuff. Trying to micromanage your schedule will lead to you not being flexible enough to enjoy the spontaneity of college. 28. Don’t schedule all your classes in the afternoon. Force yourself to get up around 8 most days, adult you who won’t be constantly late for work will thank you. 29. Google Docs are great for taking notes, as they auto-save and you can access them from any device you have (or print them after class for a paper copy). **Getting Ready for a Job** 30. Group projects are the most accurate simulation of corporate work life that exist in college, take them seriously and learn how to lead people and work together from them. 31. Don’t commute. Live on campus freshman year then room with friends each year after. Sure you’ll go into more debt (which won’t really matter if you followed the picking the right major advice), but learning to be an independent adult and getting to be immersed in the social life of a college campus is priceless. 32. Networking is the name of the game. It’s not what you know, it’s who you know (well it’s actually a bit of both, but it’s really hard to show what you know if you aren’t introduced to the right people to show it to). 33. Intern early and often. The more internships you do, the better. Don’t waste a summer waiting tables or bagging groceries, get your foot in the door in the industry, even if it’s only tangentially related to your field. 34. Join student organizations and aim to take on leadership roles. Professional societies, cultural associations, religious organizations, interest clubs, sga, etc.. Join as many as you realistically can. They are crucial resume padding items as orgs function very similar to the way corporations do. They are easy networking and also a way to meet like-minded friends or even potential partners. 35. Don’t end up in Richmond for your first job. The access to culture (sports, music, theater, etc…) is limited, most of the 20-somethings are service industry workers, and the cost of living is rapidly on the rise. The good job prospects and the exceptional young people are elsewhere, so follow them. **Financials** 36. Consider going to school 5 years rather than 4. You can stretch out your Pell Grant and other FAFSA/financial aid this way. College is also the best time of your life, and older you will be glad you got the one extra year. This will allow you to take lighter courseloads (hence better grades and more time for networking/internships/clubs/etc). Sure there’s some lost opportunity cost in one year of not making a salary, but I think it’s worth it for the added value of two extra semesters on campus developing yourself. 12 credit semesters are a vibe. 37. Limiting debt, not eliminating it, is the goal. I limited my debt to less than $10,000 by commuting, getting lucky with having poor parents and getting lots of FAFSA money, working a lot during the semesters, and luckboxing some big scholarships. I put so much effort into limiting my debt that I missed out on a lot of the opportunities that being on campus and available would’ve presented me. If you’re coming to college while working 40 hours a week, you might as well just not come to college (exception: you’re an adult making a career change). You’re wasting the opportunity. In the long run, it will absolutely pay off to take a few thousand dollars per semester out in debt to facilitate you to be able to get involved in your studies and on your campus. As long as you are studying the majors I said or have a strong plan on getting a job from a different major, $30,000 extra debt isn’t going to matter than much to you in the long run. 38. Shoot your shot at scholarships, the worst they can say is no 39. Submit your FAFSA on time for priority consideration every year. I once forgot to do it and had to take a gap year. 40. If your parents are willing to pay for things, let them. Don’t let pride get in the way of a free education. If only I could’ve been in this spot. 41. Create a budget template and stick roughly to it 42. I used to advise two years of community college to limit costs, but in hindsight that was poor advice because it inhibits you from maximizing the networking opportunities at VCU, and also in the majors I suggest, it’s better to get a higher quality education at VCU. 43. Don’t get addicted to Starbucks **Social Life** 44. Read the book How To Win Friends and Influence People by Dale Carnegie 45. You are judging yourself 100 times harder than those around you are. Most around you don’t give a shit about what you’re doing. 46. Your social life should develop organically from the student organizations you join and the people you meet in your dorm and classes 47. Start intramural teams with your friends, it’s a nice competitive outlet. Meeting friends through shared sports/exercise interests can happen too (I know rock climbing is a bit of a craze at VCU rn). 48. Be the person who’s willing to plan events and connect with friends who don’t know each other 49. Talk to everyone. It pays. Money. Every appropriate setting you go, be the person who’s willing to start the casual chit-chat. Never know where this might go. 50. Grab the IGs of everyone you meet. Getting that follower count up creates a good first impression for people who meet you and sharing stories of you doing interesting things makes it easy to filter in people interested in doing similar things. 51. I think social media in general (REDDIT INCLUDED) is a massive productivity and mental health drain. Delete stuff like TikTok & Snapchat, only use Reddit from your computer, and don’t mindlessly scroll on IG (use it purposefully to present a good image of yourself and your personality). 52. Don’t be anti-party. Go to ones you are invited to and meet people. Be responsible though. 53. Frats and sororities are underrated on Reddit, they are a social/professional network hand-delivered. Just be careful to check the vibe before you join and don’t let yourself be pressured into stuff like binge drinking on an initiation. Not saying they are right for everyone, just that they have some value to the right sorts of people. 54. Try to meet an older student in your major you can trust that will mentor you. A “big” so to speak. 55. Don’t wallow in how you’re an introvert. Just keep putting yourself out there until you start enjoying it. Ofc you’re going to think you’re an introvert if all you’ve ever done after school is Reddit and video games, try another way of living. Like it or not, people with good social skills and large social networks make it further in life. **Dating (advice will have a straight male skew)** 56. Your dating life should also develop very organically. I made things way too complicated for myself in college, hyper-obsessing over trying to get a girlfriend, when in reality my first relationship came pretty simply through just starting a convo with a girl in a student org I was in and hitting it off. 57. That being said, you still have to shoot your shot. I can think of so many times where I just naturally met girls who were showing signs of interest in me (emailing me out the blue to study together, offering to give me a ride across campus, smiling and waving at me every time they saw me outside of class), and I was too timid to ask them out. The fear of building a negative reputation stopped me from doing what I thought was “shitting where I eat.” Don’t be like that. If there’s someone you click with naturally, go for it as soon as you can. Be direct in your intentions and ask them on a DATE (saying the word, because I can’t count the number of times I ended up on platonic hangouts because I didn’t specify my intents). A simple template: ask them what their favorite food is, then say “we should go on a (insert that food) date (insert evening you have some free time).” First dates don’t need to complex, I also fucked quite a few chances up by going for these elaborate first date requests that were just too much of a commitment (ex: bowling, mini golf, concerts, etc… these are better second dates). 58. Stop blaming your height and ethnicity for your lack of dating success. Relentlessly pursue your best self (especially with fitness), and you will find dating success. 59. Don’t get in a serious relationship without first analyzing if there are any clear incompatibilities that’ll turn into dealbreakers. Don’t ignore them if you see them, cut your losses early before the relationship wrecks your mental and physical health. 60. Don’t get in a serious relationship and then immediately get complacent. Most people I know (myself included) gained weight and stopped hanging around their friends the moment they got in a relationship. Others lost focus on their career ambitions. Don’t do this, grow together instead. 61. If you're afraid to talk to the (insert gender you’re interested in) go to a local mall and start 10 convos with someone of that gender asking for directions. Then do 10 more, complimenting them on something about their clothes. Congratulations, you’re not afraid anymore. Exposure therapy. 62. Class can also be a very good place to get dates. It’s really just as simple as getting to class early enough on day 1 to make sure you can grab a seat by the cutest person and then just start a convo about the class and go from there. I’d urge you not to go the study buddy route, I tried that way too many times and it’s a ticket to the friendzone, honesty with your intentions is key. 63. Fashion + hygiene goes a long way in making you appealing to romantic prospects 64. Guys, don’t be too frustrated if your dating life doesn’t pop off Freshman year. On average, women mature faster than men and hence prefer slightly older guys. When you’re the junior (or even sophomore) who’s been putting in the work on yourself, you’ll start getting chances. 65. Don’t be that person who refuses to date in college. I met a lot of people like this talking about how they’re too busy with their grind or just not interested in dating, and I think it’s a big mistake. It’s literally the last time in your life you’ll be surrounded by like-minded people of the same age group who are generally open to meeting new people. Take it from a dude in his mid-20s, it is rough out here in the post-college land, take advantage of the abundance of options constantly surrounding you. Get some experience and maybe even meet your life partner. **VCU/RVA Specific Tidbits** 66. VCU is an urban campus, which imo makes it by far the most fun and stimulating campus in Virginia. It’s basically intertwined with the city at this point (for better or worse), so you get full access to all the fun stuff the city has to offer. 67. The GRTC Pulse is free and can take you pretty much everywhere interesting in Richmond 68. Richmond is a nice concert city (The National, The Broadberry, The Camel, Canal Club, VACU Live, Browns Island, house shows, etc…). Expand your music taste by looking up some bands coming to town soon and go to a few shows. It’s super fun, can help you meet people, and it’s also something you can invite existing friends to. Most of these venues are just a Pulse ride away. 69. Circuit Arcade + Bar is my favorite date spot in RVA (it’s over 21 after 9 though), there’s an easy pivot to food or a movie nearby. 70. Carytown is a close second. Classy area. 71. VCU basketball games are an incredible experience, especially if you go with friends. The student fan group (Rowdy Rams) also does a trip to the A10 tournament every year that is insanely cheap and gets you to a new city with other students for a good time. 72. Belle Isle is the ultimate beautiful fall/spring day destination with your friend group 73. The VMFA, Maymont, and Canal Walk are three other awesome spots to get away from the stress and see something beautiful. 74. Floor 2 of the Commons is the best spot on campus to get away from the hustle and just relax. I’ve even gone there to cry before, it’s just the perfect spot to be calm and invisible for a bit. 75. There’s plenty of free Parking at VCU if you go down Harrison St past the gym. Can avoid a parking pass entirely if you’re willing to walk a little 76. The Campus Learning Center is a great resource for FREE help in your classes. 77. The renovations they’ve done to Monroe Park are amazing, and it’s a great spot to chill and get work done or hang out. 78. Richmond is a really easy drive (if you have a group) to just about anywhere on the east coast. Would be super easy to do a trip with friends to VA Beach, NYC, DC, the mountains, Philly, Baltimore, etc…. Travel a bit if you can find people who are down. 79. Short Pump is hyped up a lot, but honestly, it’s not worth the drive. There’s not much you can do there you can’t downtown, and the vibe of it is very much adult. 80. Look both ways when you cross the street. You are in a city with lots of traffic. 81. I think the safety concerns at VCU are really overexaggerated by anxious people, but yeah be vigilant and don’t wander too far off campus alone at night. 82. Make Cabbell Library your home away from home, it’s such an amazing lib. Floor 2 was the sweet spot for getting studying done for me, but I’d advise you and your friends to all find a spot you like and have it be the spot you constantly come and go. Can lead to lots of spontaneous social interactions. 83. Run the Monument Avenue 10K every year, and maybe one year get ambitious and try the hm or marathon. Supports the fitness goal and gives you a nice photo op at the end. 84. Try the many restaurants of RVA. I personally stuck heavily to Taco Bell (rip), Chipotle, Panda, Hibachi Box, Christian’s, and Subway… and I regret it. Be adventurous with your eating and invite people to adventure with you. The one spot I’ll recommend is Sushi King at lunchtime. **Post-Graduation** 85. College is over, so get over it. I spent way too much time in my post-college depression phase where I desperately wanted nothing but to go back to the college environment. I’d even drive back to campus and just chill in my old spots just to be there. Don’t do that, it’s not healthy. When you’re done, move on. 86. If you’ve done the work I said before this point, you’re basically set up to coast with a few minor adjustments. You’ll have the requisite major, fitness, social skills, and experience to quickly excel above your peers at work and in life. 87. It will take time to adjust. Corporate life ain’t easy nor is being under true financial pressure. But once you build a 6-month emergency fund in savings and get through your first annual performance review unscathed, you’ll start to calm down and enjoy this new lifestyle. 88. Get in a disciplined routine. Time is your biggest asset in college. You don’t have that as an adult, a bare minimum of 40 hours a week will go towards your career (more likely even more). You need to manage that time exceptionally well to be able to find a balance between work, fitness, and hobbies. Wake up early and exercise before work. Work. Do some studying for career development after work. Do your chores. Then be free to enjoy your hobbies and social life. 89. Dress for success 90. Find your adult social circle (and set reasonable expectations for what role they will play in your life). I wanted that How I Met Your Mother style 6 person tightly knit friend group who hung at the bar every night despite having awesome careers. That’s a bullshit fantasy. You will probably at best see your friends 1-2 times a week, and that’s ok. Learn to make use of that time to do life-enriching activities rather than just chilling and shooting the shit. 91. Save money & budget strictly. You got to get that 6-month emergency fund or the financial anxiety will eat you alive. Put 20% towards savings (you should be able to afford to do this if you studied the right things like I said). 92. Meal prep. Saves an ungodly amount of money and helps with fitness. 93. Max out your 401k contribution, the employer match is a 100% ROI investment. 94. Keep networking 95. Continue your education (I’m not saying go to grad school, just keep learning through industry certifications and adult classes) 96. Travel. You’ve done the hard work and got the big bucks, so go see the world. It just gives you a whole new perspective on life, especially if like me you were a poor kid who barely left your hometown. 97. Dating is going to be a lot harder if you don’t wind up with someone you met from college. You may have to look beyond your social circle for options. 98. Stay in touch with your family. Mend those broken bonds. I am being forced to spend my early 20s living at home because my parents are broke and my mom is dying. Do I regret it? No. Family are the people who matter most at the end of the day, and you will regret it to your core if you disregard those relationships until it’s too late. Obviously, if your parents are truly abusive or irredeemable people, ignore this, but for 90% of you who don’t get along with your parents, it’s over petty nonsense. Or maybe you’re just upset because they pushed you too hard as a kid (the world is a tough place and they were pushing you so hard because they know what it takes to succeed and wanted what’s best for you in the long run). 99. Share your wisdom with younger family/community members. Way too many people are completely butchering the way they live from 18-25, myself included. We need to educate more people on what it takes to actually set yourself up for a successful adulthood. **Other** 100. Lastly, and most importantly: **HAVE FUN**. College is truly the most fun time of your life. You will never again be surrounded by this many intelligent, like-minded, and friendly people of a similar age who have the free time to enjoy life with you. + at VCU you get all of this + you’re in a real-world city with lots of things to do off campus. I met someone recently who was telling me about how college is the bane of their existence and my heart broke a little bit for her. Your classes are not designed to be difficult to the point you don’t have time to enjoy things. Learn to manage your time and prioritize mental, physical, and social health and these years will be incredible. Life isn’t all doom and gloom after college, don’t let anyone tell you that either (you’ll actually make enough money to take trips and do the expensive stuff you like), but college is just a unique and magical place where the youthful energy combined with lack of responsibility and abundance of free time people have create this hyper-social environment where life is amazing. Enjoy it. Adult you will daydream of going back.",2022-08-10 21:15:32,87
comment,"100 pieces of candid advice about VCU, college, & life from an alumni who had to learn the hard way","Regarding 35 - i don't know that you did during undergrad but you're just completely wrong dude and that's shit advice. In the city you have The National, The Byrd , Altria, VMFA, Maymont, First Fridays, The Coliseum, The Diamond, The Kickers, James River Park System and other venues/events periodically that provide a wide access to culture (sports, music, theater, etc.) sure it's not like the DC area but to say it's limited is a complete lie. Regarding jobs yeah most of the 20 somethings are service industry workers because a) they're college kids (undergrad/post grad) or b) really enjoy that type of work/are working on another job and this is temp. There are good jobs in Richmond (Medical/Finance/Marketing) and really awesome people, if you find a company you enjoy and enjoy the area, then ride it out and see how you feel in a year. But to say the job prospects aren't here is a total lie. >Don’t end up in Richmond for your first job.

comment,"100 pieces of candid advice about VCU, college, & life from an alumni who had to learn the hard way","I’m getting pretty tired of the rhetoric that you won’t make friends or have great experiences if you don’t completely tear down your private life. You’re going to spend an average of 3 hours every day with people inside the classroom, collaborating with your classmates in and out of class. You’ll at one point be in one or more students orgs to collaborate and make connections there. You’ll probably be eating with these people as well, but even if you aren’t who cares. You’re going to be surrounded by a myriad of people and have plenty of options. If you like to study by yourself or want to watch a show alone, go for it. You’re not a hermit for valuing some alone time. If you like to play video games, probably have an online selection of friends, than there’s nothing wrong with that either. That’s still socialization. College, believe it or not, shouldn’t be your peak. You shouldn’t go into your adult years wishing you had a time machine. You shouldn’t feel like you’re on borrowed time because all you’ll do is stress yourself out more than you probably will be from class, homesickness, and general life. And if you want to talk to everyone you’ll cross paths with and sleep in your dorm with the door open, by all means, that’s okay too. Just don’t subscribe to a notion that your college experience should pan out one way and anything else is inherently wrong.",2022-08-28 21:11:36,3

Even in a large lecture, if you have questions, go to the professor afterwards and ask. Being an interested and connected student is important on several levels; the most basic being greater knowledge and higher grades, but also the more intangible ones such as getting to know your professor (I keep in touch with several of mine after 30+ years), or having a relationship with someone who can later write you an informed recommendation for graduate school.",2022-09-02 11:03:43,1
comment,"100 pieces of candid advice about VCU, college, & life from an alumni who had to learn the hard way","I think Richmond is a great college city (you can read in my RVA/VCU tidbits section how much I love almost all those activities you listed), wouldn't recommend another school in VA over VCU, but I think it becomes less enjoyable (but not completely unenjoyable) after graduation, at least in my experience. It's going to completely depend on your personality and what you value though. I personally value live entertainment (concerts (arena and niche bands skip RVA for DC/Raleigh), sports, theater, comedy, etc...), meeting a high volume of new & diverse people who have similar goals/are in the same season of life as me, ambition, weird new experiences, not having to drive, amazing restaurants, fun activities, etc... Basically, I like to be hyper-stimulated and be in a walking/public transport distance of everything I do so I don't have to save energy to drive home (and so I don't have to get way too much sleep so I don't die during my morning commute) Maybe that's the difference in our perceptions of RVA's access to culture, I've just set a really high bar for the amount of access I want, and it can't keep up. Richmond has a lot of these things to an extent, but bigger cities completely blow them out of the water in these areas. If you're a more even-keeled personality who's looking for comfort & stability, then Richmond is 100% a great city to wind up in and start a life for yourself. Personally, I'm just really bored of it and really wish I could go move to NYC with a friend of mine who's really getting to live that high-flying 20s lifestyle I want. I can't though, my parents are poor/sick and need the financial support, so it's just a fantasy (also had to turn down the chance to pursue huge jobs in my industry because I had to confine my search to RVA, which ended me up in a dead end entry level job). And it's also not that the 20-somethings in RVA being service industry workers makes me want to not be their friends, it's that it's hard to be their friends because we usually run completely different schedules and have little in common.",2022-08-11 14:22:47,1

comment,"100 pieces of candid advice about VCU, college, & life from an alumni who had to learn the hard way","You don't have to completely tear down your private life, and taking time to get away from it all is advisable (maybe an occasional Saturday back home or locked away in your dorm), but I stand by that the best way to generate value out of your college experience is to put in a lot of effort to be involved & social. Again, my advice is just based on my experience (analyzing why my college experience was largely a failure, and things I'd change about it if I had a mulligan), so take it with a grain of salt. You absolutely can succeed in college being a total hermit, or even just being modestly involved, but I'm just saying you'd succeed even more if you incorporated lots of socializing/networking/orgs. From my vantage point, the people who are living the best lives as adults (have nice jobs, get to travel a lot, have a large social and professional network of people all across the country, have hobbies they are proud of and maybe even can monetize) are the ones who were focusing on being involved in different communities/interests across campus, and seldom went a day without being on campus and socially active. And yes, college shouldn't be your peak, that's the point I'm trying to make. You need to put a lot of effort into laying the foundations for successful adulthood during college. These things which are relatively easy to fix during college (fitness, career, finding friends/a partner, etc) become immensely more difficult to fix when you're thrust into a 40+ hour a week corporate job coupled with massive financial responsibility. Not to mention that as an adult, there's no just walking outside your dorm and seeing 30,000 people your age with shared experiences who are ready to socialize with you, you've got to look really hard and be very forward if you want to try to work your way into pre-defined social circles as an adult. And a college semester is like 16 weeks, with a week worth of breaks worked in. My advise would be to just push yourself really hard in all areas during those 16 weeks, then go really hard at your non-social hobbies during the break when people aren't around campus. 16 weeks of study/networking/gym/etc followed by a month of binging Netflix, video games, etc. I'm just saying that as an adult who spent a lot of time in college on Netflix & video games especially, that I have plenty of time to play those now if I want to, but I don't have any way to live that sort of a hyper social lifestyle again.",2022-09-04 10:17:08,1

comment,"100 pieces of candid advice about VCU, college, & life from an alumni who had to learn the hard way","I value the same level of entertainment (grew up in the DC Area) but you're still in a central point where you can drive/carpool or take a train/bus to DC or Charlottesville or Norfolk to catch a big name concert, but also you have to look at Richmond being a small city so there are gives and takes, you're never gonna get the DC, LA or NYC or Chicago experience but to say Richmond doesn't offer: >high volume of new & diverse people who have similar goals/are in the same season of life as me, ambition, weird new experiences, not having to drive, amazing restaurants, fun activities, etc... is completely false, you get all of that in the city and campus. ""You get back, what you put out"" applies to that above and below: >And it's also not that the 20-somethings in RVA being service industry workers makes me want to not be their friends, it's that it's hard to be their friends because we usually run completely different schedules and have little in common. You'd be surprised how much you actually do have in common and when you actually make time for your friends, most of my friends/roommates were service industry people and we always made the effort or time to see each other/keep in touch still to this day, I'll drop by and visit them at work whenever I am in town or driving through.

comment,"100 pieces of candid advice about VCU, college, & life from an alumni who had to learn the hard way","Depends on what the activities you're doing are. If you're studying a great major you have a good plan for, working out consistently, on leadership in a couple student orgs, and have a great internship lined up for the summer, and that feels easy for you, great! I'm not saying burn yourself out trying to do too much. But what I'm saying is that most people probably aren't pushing themselves as hard as they could be, and that'll be a regret for them when they reach my age. Me personally I thought I was pushing myself hard because I got top gradesand had an ok job on campus, even if my life felt like a total breeze and I had like maybe 30 hours of responsibility a week. So when you're life feels easy, ask yourself if it's because you've actually built sustainable habits that make the inputs to the success you desire just feel completely natural, or if it's because you're simply doing easy activities. If I had pushed myself with just a harder major, more involvement in orgs, applying for ambitious internships, and developing a gym routine my life in college would not have felt easy. It would've been a struggle. I'd probably have had a 3.0 rather than a 4.0 most semesters. But in doing so, I'd have learned so much more and pushed myself so much further, that I'd be way further along as an adult. Cruising to a 4.0 every semester is a telltale sign you just don't have enough on your plate. So I guess I stand by what I said. If college feels extremely easy to you, you're probably missing out on valuable growth because you're cherrypicking activities that are too easy.",2022-09-07 14:53:55,1
comment,"100 pieces of candid advice about VCU, college, & life from an alumni who had to learn the hard way","I never said it's impossible, it's definitely not, I just said it gets more difficult. In college, you can meet people through orgs, classes, parties, or even just randomly on campus. In adulthood, you have to start relying on shitty apps, drunk interactions at bars/clubs, and workplace crushes that you're afraid you'll ruin your career if you take action on. Your social circle as an adult (especially if you didn't establish a nice college friend group), just isn't giving you opportunities on a silver platter like it would in college. At the very least, college is the right time to get a lot of dating experience to make yourself more ready for the more infrequent opportunities that you come across in adulthood.",2022-09-04 10:19:41,1

comment,"100 pieces of candid advice about VCU, college, & life from an alumni who had to learn the hard way","""I value the same level of entertainment"" I don't think you do (and that's why we are disagreeing), because if you did you'd recognize the massive gulf in quality/quantity between entertainment access in RVA compared to the biggest cities. We've got two 3rd tier sports teams, these cities have 5+ big league teams. We get a Nascar race twice a year, they get almost every major sporting tour every year. We get lots of great mid-tier concerts, they get every single band gigantic or niche that tours on every cycle. We've got some great restaurants, they've got many world-class ones. And with career choices too. We've got 8 Fortune 500 companies, NYC has 65. Not trying to shit on Richmond, it's a great city, but let's not understate how much more entertainment & career chances bigger cities have. If someone is very ambitious and loves that sort of stimulating lifestyle, why not go find the biggest job in the biggest city this can and try out that lifestyle? There's always the choice to later come back to RVA (with a much-inflated salary offer).",2022-08-11 21:49:07,-3
comment,"100 pieces of candid advice about VCU, college, & life from an alumni who had to learn the hard way","Yes, that's what I was trying to say, the whole post was a reflection on how my experience in college failed to set me up for successful adulthood. Which is why I recommend doing a lot of delayed gratification activities in college (study a TEM major, networking, working out, etc...) that will help set you up for adulthood success. But at the same time as doing the hard work, you can acknowledge that the environment of college (being surrounded by like-minded people in your age group who've got an abundance of free time and are generally really social) is a once-in-a-lifetime phenomenon and should be enjoyed while you're there. No one I know who's an adult is living a more fun or social lifestyle than they were in college. There are plenty of silver linings to adulthood (being able to afford amazing vacations, financial stability, expensive hobbies, etc), but college is definitely the last chance to live that hypersocial a lifestyle.",2022-09-07 14:41:51,2

I'm all for constructive criticism on this, as I said it's a very biased POV and I originally made it just to help a family member out, but ended up with something that felt worth sharing. But if you're going to criticize, at least understand what I wrote first. *“Don’t study STEM if you want a job out of undergrad” --* (I did not say this) **I said don't study** ***Science*** **if you want a job out of undergrad. TEM I recommend highly (I rate them the best majors). I've known many people who study science and can't find a quality job without going to grad school.** *“Delete your games. People who level up online don’t level up IRL”* **Just my opinion. You also conveniently left out the** ***""during the semester""*** **rider to the advice. I found my video game addiction really hurt my social life. People who are less addicted and able to play casually might not need to worry about that so much. The family member I started writing this for also has a serious video game addiction.** *""Aside from the common sense financial advice and “don’t get a degree if u don’t care about the major”….It doesn’t read like “a victory lap about how I succeeded in college”* **Paragraph 2 of the post starts with: “This post** ***isn’t*** **a victory lap about how I succeeded in college, it’s lots of hard lessons I learned as a first-generation college student who had no role model for how to set myself up to achieve long-run success during college, and despite having good intentions ended up making a lot of bad decisions that led to (currently) having a mediocre career, limited social life, and poor mental/physical health.” This was a failure lap, not a victory lap, and I acknowledged that, so stop trying to paint me as this arrogant person bragging about his success (I'd have to be delusional to do that with my current life situation).** **I also did not say ""don't get a degree if u don't care about the major."" In fact, I said the opposite. I said to pick a high-quality major, and back engineer that to a job, unless you have a truly blazing passion for a career in a less high quality major and are smart/disciplined enough to distinguish yourself from the competition.** *“It sounds like a huge list of oddly specific advice that nobody asked for from some 30 something person who truly believes college was the best time of their life Becuase they walked in a Christian sexist and came out an educated yuppie lol”* **Yes, it’s oddly specific advice because it’s my biased POV, which I acknowledged. Someone did ask for it (my family member) and I just thought it ended up being worth sharing. And, I’m mid 20’s. I don’t have a well-paying job or a fashionable lifestyle (at least relative to what a college-educated person should have). This wasn’t a “How I Succeeded” post, it was a “How I Failed” post. Yes I do think college was the best time of my life, and I explain thoroughly why (because social life is on easy mode compared to adulthood).** So like at least read and try to comprehend what I wrote if you’re going to flame it. You're completely misrepresenting my argument. I don't know if you're intentionally misrepresenting what I said to be a douche or you just have the reading comprehension skills of a 6th grader, but either way it's an unfair way to argue.

post,"Dear drivers, please don't stop at green lights to let people cross","Dear drivers, please don't stop at green lights to let people cross I know you think you're being nice, but you're going to get someone killed. Not only is that a good way to get rear-ended, but you're fucking up the traffic pattern for everybody. Just yesterday I saw a student almost get creamed at the light in front of the Temple building, because someone someone stopped at the green light and waved them across, and a car in the other lane (rightfully) drove through and almost hit them. If they had gotten run over, it wouldn't have been fault of the driver that hit him, it would have been the fault of the car that stopped, and of the pedestrian for not paying attention. TL;DR, If you have the right of way, USE it. You're not being as helpful as you think you are.",2020-01-17 13:45:40,82

comment,"Dear drivers, please don't stop at green lights to let people cross","SO MUCH THIS. I’ve been crossing main st in front of Snead every god damn day of my life for the past 2 years and I shit you not, every other day some wayward samaritan stops in the middle lane during rush hour to let a flock of students by. Just today I saw a girl nearly get flattened. And yes, of course use common sense and don’t cross when this happens but SO OFTEN when you don’t cross the person gets mad as hell. I have been cursed out for not accepting an offer to cross. Literally had them roll down the window and flip me off, call me a bitch or to gfm. I think in that period of stillness—pedestrian locking eyes with driver—they realize how idiotic they look stopped dead in the middle of a four lane road and become distressingly insecure, lashing out. So I can see how some students could feel intimidated into accepting an offer to cross without thinking. Especially kids coming from rural/suburban areas that aren’t used to crossing busy streets. And even if the person isn’t glaring daggers at you for UNDERSTANDABLY HESITATING, it’s just an awkward situation that can cause a lapse in judgement. For that I can’t blame the students crossing too terribly much; the driver’s at fault for being a moron first. Good lord, if this isn’t my hugest pet peeve. Sorry for the caps, I’m passionate and also on mobile.",2020-01-23 23:31:53,2

comment,We got pass fail,"My understanding (as an advisor) is that your current academic standing won’t change if you choose to make ALL of your classes pass/fail, and then you pass all of them. Otherwise, academic standing will be calculated as normal: you will roll into probation if your cumulative GPA stays below 2.0, or you will go back on good standing if your cumulative GPA increases to 2.0 or higher. But yes- please also talk to your advisor!! They can help you figure out how to run the numbers on your GPA calc to see what makes the most sense for you specifically. It’s especially important to speak to them if you’re doing historical repeats this semester.",2020-03-28 10:52:32,1

comment,Offering parallel parking lessons for $100,"I know this was created for jokes, but as a former valet I can provide some free advice: 1) Use your side mirrors: barring unusual circumstances, you likely have a car with side mirrors that enable you to alter the angle being shown. When you’re parallel parking these are your friends because they will help you gauge how close your tire is getting to the curb as your backing in. Please use them. 2) Use your rear tires: sounds silly, but heat me out. People forget that tires are heavily rubberized, and therefore quite strong. If you’re backing in slowly and paying attention to how close the front and back of the car is to the vehicle you’re in between, it’s okay to tap the curb with your tire. Just make sure that it’s the rubber and not the rim (the scratchable/breakable part).

comment,"You know a total ban on ""greek life"" would probably be better.","I can understand the disdain for fraternities, and yes there are problems that they introduce, but it’s narrow minded to say they should just be banned. Many of the problems that come with “fraternities” are more or less just problems that are exacerbated by alcohol. Though I expect if VCU became a dry campus and started punishing students over 21 for having alcohol a lot of people would be upset even if they supported getting getting rid of frats. Not to mention all the other consequences that could come of that. That might mean sororities need to be removed as well, and frats and sororities that exist to support students of color. I just feel like that solution is overreaching, and I think it’s coming from a place of personal spite",2023-02-22 16:36:57,8
comment,"You know a total ban on ""greek life"" would probably be better.","Sup. I live in Richmond and have an anecdote to share regarding frats, and propose a potential idea for a solution. I started college at Southern Illinois University - Carbondale. the year (or two) before my freshman year, there was a hazing incident where 3 people died by drowning in the campus lake after having consumed large amounts of alcohol. As a response to this, the university shut down ALL fraternities for 3 years. Sororities were left to operate as normal. During that 3 year period the university studied frat behavior and what led to this culture of hazing. When frats were allowed to restart it was under much more scrutiny from the school with a lot more limitations on what was allowed. I feel a similar idea could work at VCU. shut down for a year or two, study what is fueling the bad culture, attempt to re-start under higher scrutiny/supervision with objective outcome measures.

comment,"You know a total ban on ""greek life"" would probably be better.","I dont think you understand what the terms wet and dry campus means. VCU is a dry campus because it doesnt provide alcohol at student events nor do they allow drinking in any of their dormitories even if you are above 21. Wet campus would be for example during Welcome Week at Casino night they provided alcohol for students if over the age of 21. Fraternities/Sororities, even though they are 100% associated with the school, throwing parties is not a VCU sponsored event so providing alcohol doesn't make VCU a wet campus, using that logic every college in the country would be wet campus. Now if a fraternity/sorority were providing alcohol at an official recruiting event that they have in the commons then that would definitely be a big no no because again VCU is a dry campus.

comment,Did I miss something?,"That is so valid. Found some interesting facts: 1) civil wars in America are not officially declared. The president can issue the Insurrection act, but neither congress nor the president can declare war on the people. It’s determined that a civil war previously happened, not announced that it is happening 2) they consist of two+ sustained and organized opposing groups [one side being the government] 3) goal is to assume control over the state or nation, not simply riot/protest 4) 1,000 battlefield deaths must occur to rule out political unrest. With all of that I’d say the daily/weekly massacres, senator executions, “political public figure” assassination, assassination attempts on the president, murder by police, all the cyber warfare you pointed towards, and talks of murdering all the mentally ill homeless people seem to be pretty on par with the criteria 😶 I don’t even want to know what we don’t know.

I’ve met several die hard republican students that said they were uncomfortable claiming it because of how badly the extremist have painted the party.

You can still just feel that there are fewer people on campus and in the library. I'm sure they've cut staffing as a result. Not sure what's the solution because Cabell 24/7 is a godsend for folks who have a crappy roommate / living situation. Wish VCU would staff an alternative 24 hour study space.

Your landlord owes you a safe place to live that means no mold. https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/virginia-rules-regarding-mold-rental-properties.html Read this. You must send them your landlord in writing to send notice notice to start the clock. https://oag.dc.gov/sites/default/files/2018-02/Sample-Mold-Notice-Letter.pdf You can find other sample letters online. Short and sweet. Send your land lord a email with photos, video's, letting them know you see mold or suspect mold. Ask them about where they plan on relocating you Ask they to pay for a hotel or provide you a new place to live while they fix your residences. Ask them to conduct a mold test an an sample to determine if the room is safe. Ask them to preform mold remediation so they are not in breach of the land lord landlord tenant law. When you send a email email CC everyone under the sun. then send a certified to who ever your landlord is. Everyone person you CC can be called into court if it ends up there. You also might want to get a lawyer involved now if you have found mold. The following is information you should review. Ask them to respond immediate. https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title8.01/chapter3/section8.01-226.12/ ""Notice"" means notice given in writing by either regular mail or hand delivery, with sender retaining sufficient proof of having given such notice, which may be either a United States postal certificate of mailing or a certificate of service confirming such mailing prepared by the sender. However, a person shall be deemed to have notice of a fact if he has actual knowledge of it, or he received a verbal notice of it. A person ""notifies"" or ""gives"" a notice or notification to another by taking steps reasonably calculated to inform another person whether or not the other person actually comes to know of it. If a notice given is not in writing, the person giving the notice has the burden of proof to show that the notice was given to the recipient of the notice. https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/environmental-health/public-health-toxicology/mold/ Mold can be bad for your heath. General Information Health Effects from Mold Exposure Some people are affected by the presence of mold while others can live in places with a large amount of mold and not experience any symptoms. Allergic reaction is the most commonly reported health effect of mold exposure. If you cough, wheeze, or have difficulty breathing around mold, you may be sensitive to certain molds. If continuously exposed to mold, some people may develop symptoms such as watery, itchy, burning or red eyes; nose or throat irritation; sneezing; coughing or wheezing; constant headaches; memory problems or mood changes; aches and pains; and in some cases, hives, welts, or skin rash. Mold spores cannot be seen but can be inhaled, which can cause irritation or infection in the lungs and make it harder to breathe. Those who are more likely than others to develop symptoms from mold exposure include young children, the elderly, pregnant women, and people with asthma or other respiratory diseases. People with suppressed immune systems (e.g. HIV/AIDs infection, organ transplant patients, chemotherapy patients) should avoid heavy mold infestations. If possible, susceptible individuals should not live in buildings where mold is growing, and should consult their family physician if symptoms develop or persist. Black Mold One species of mold (Stachbotrys chartarum), known as black mold, may cause more serious health effects to people who are sensitive to mold. For more information, you can view our Freqently Asked Questions about Black Mold document here. So here we are. OP please let us know what happens.",2022-10-08 19:23:15,11

comment,Student housing is a joke.,"I think that comment boils down to,1) since it's a complaint about student housing it's likely the first place someone has lived outside of their parent/guardians home, thus ""kids"" or new to the world of rentals 2) while others are very right you to have a legal right to a clean rental, the fact this is coming out in October as opposed to pre-move in means the university is unlikely to be held legally responsible for damages as long as it's addressed quickly (within the legally prescribed time) 3) this is a lesson learned for the majority of housing you'll be able to afford during school and for a decade or so after... For-profit housing (and unfortunately non-profit housing) put as little money in to maintenance as possible often ascribing to the old adage ""it's better to ask forgiveness than permission"" + ""a dose of prevention is cheaper than an ounce of cure""(the prevention is the lease agreement saying you're responsible to tell them if they missed something) which = more money for the landlord. If you don't check before you move in, they're off the hook (in most cases) and most people don't tear out the air vents before moving in... There's a reason VCU is putting out studies linking social violence to ""slum lord's"". Sure student housing isn't ""great"" but wait till you compare it to your other options Please don't take this as victim blaming, unless you have a trust fund, most of us have been there and feel the same rage... Unfortunately the great American corporation favors the business over the plebian and the laws reflect that.",2022-10-15 12:59:25,2
comment,Student housing is a joke.,I mean like go off I guess. But maybe if VCU spent less time getting scammed out of half a million dollars and more time maintaining healthy living conditions they wouldn’t be getting shat on so much.,2022-10-08 23:00:30,11

comment,Student housing is a joke.,"I understand where you're coming from and I hear what you're saying, I certainly don't have a trust fund, and I know others understand how frustrating this is. Mold is common, and even more common in dorms. However, less than a year ago a freshman housing hall was shut down due to toxic black mold. VCU has been in the media and received complaints about mold and unsafe living conditions for decades, and it's never properly addressed. I've reported mold to housing in the past, and all that was done was them wiping it off with a dry paper towel. On top of that, several housing halls with 12-month leases were required to move everything out over the summer so they could do ""deep cleaning and maintenance."" Yet, the wall surrounding my air vent is visibly rotting due to mold. So, that means one of two things, either they 1. Actually addressed the mold, and it grew and developed to this state in the span of two months. 2. The mold was never addressed over the summer, or they just did a spot clean/painted over it. I knew what I was getting into when signing up for student housing. But I also pay $5,000 a year to live here and expect safe living conditions. My health has been severely affected by this as I have a mold allergy. I hope I'm not coming across as entitled or snotty in this post. I'm just extremely frustrated.",2022-10-15 13:19:13,1

comment,Student housing is a joke.,"That was 2014. NCAA landscape has changed so much since then. Having a football team also completely changes the dynamic of the school as well.

Also even if that sport loses money, the university will get more publicity and in turn ends up helping their academic departments as well.",2022-10-09 08:09:08,3

comment,Student housing is a joke.,"You're not coming across snotty or entitled at all... But I can see youthful and optimistic 😁. The fact that they shut down and relocated students points to the university attempting to address the problem (whether they did or not is uncertain as you stated), spot cleaning and repainting with a fungicidal paint is a common remediation technique, and if you think your vents are bad for a place your paying 5,000 a year for just wait till you see the vents and state of the rest of the apartment in a rental in a similar location (though not as prime) that you pay 8k to 14k for. Again I'm not saying you don't have a right to be upset, you do, document everything and rage against the machine... When the machine spits out the same bullshit it has for decades then it's time to buckle down, understand the parts of the machine that work and the parts that are broken, and use this frustration (and the frustration to come) to fuel the effort that's required to fix it.

comment,Student housing is a joke.,"Just because you have a sports team doesn't mean it's generating publicity/revenue in a meaningful way, especially enough to outweigh the costs. Your team really has to be consistently near the top; which most aren't. The vast majority of programs are going to be huge financial drags on the University; picking on Football, just think of the amount of coaches, support staff, scholarships, building maintenance, travel, etc that it goes in to field a team. Unless you are playing on a big TV network every week, you aren't coming close to breaking even. Ever. Even schools like Virginia Tech and UVA subsidize their Athletics departments with student dollars. They suck now, but both these programs used to be consistently good, and their basketball teams are both pretty good. I'm not sure what is exactly helping an academic department. Faculty certainty aren't choosing which school to teach at based on it's sporting team; they're choosing 100% based on pay, location, and if they're able to do their research/get tenure. These are academics after all. Maybe enrollment? But once again, making a huge assumption on publicity and popularity of sports. I like watching some sports, but not everyone does, and a lot of people don't watch at all. I mean hell, I'd say a very sizeable chunk of VCU's student body doesn't give a shit about the basketball team. I'd bet if we did have football even fewer would care about that.",2022-10-09 08:58:07,2

post,For the first time in my life got above a 3.5 for a semester,"For the first time in my life got above a 3.5 for a semester Was considered ""gifted"" as a kid, but ever since middle school my grades had always been mediocre to subpar. Never failing but ended highschool with a 2 .7 I thought I would change in college but a whole bunch of different things like laziness and general isolation always made it hard to feel motivated to improve, I mean, I got into college so what's the point of trying to go above and beyond right? I told myself I was satisfied even if I didn't reach to what my goals were. So for a solid 3 years if I got at least a 3.0 I patted myself on the back said ""good enough"" But idk if it's the fact I'm graduating next year, or that I finally am starting to get an idea of what I want for my life but I got a real fire this semester to try and actually push myself for the first time since I was like 11. And it ended up with me getting a 3.8. It honestly feels like a rush I haven't felt before and it makes me not wanna go back to that sense of satisfaction I had before. I don't wanna say I've ""leveled up"" but damn it feels good to give it you best and succeed. So if anyone needs a story to give them a fire to try you best, take this one :)",2025-05-13 22:57:29,75

comment,"If a university professor’s entire class structure consists of fill-in-the-blank worksheets and Netflix, should they still have a job?","Is the issue that two professors used the same content? In that instance, maybe the classes are related or cover similar topics, so perhaps the content is relevant for both. Most professors don’t confer in detail with each other on every single item/assignment. They may not even realize two of them are using it in a similar manner, unless they shared it with each other and in that case it’s probably intentional because they like it so much. Or is the issue that they are showing videos entirely in lieu of teaching? We’re 3ish weeks into the semester. Was it just 1 class so far this term or a repeated issue? Interspacing videos, questions, discussions, exercises, and other items is an age old education method that goes back to your elementary school years. They do it to keep you awake and/or vaguely interested because honestly when I sit in class about 1/3 of the students are half asleep and another 1/3 are just playing on their phone/laptop.

And we only watched the first episode of the Netflix series. Together, that comes to $4,000 worth of Netflix.",2025-02-02 00:24:41,3

This is not just a private chat with your classmates. 22,000 people have seen this post. People are crazy and violent. Edit the name out. Also, that's a completely different problem. You describe your class as being 'content heavy' In my class, the information is not there. Everyone is getting A's. The upper-level classes do not provide the rigor expected of sixth-grade classes. Our textbook is a novel and the only other major source material for the class is a Netflix documentary. That documentary only covers one major event. This is across classes and with different professors. My diploma will just be a piece of paper if I don't get some harder classes than this.",2025-02-03 00:23:17,1

comment,"If a university professor’s entire class structure consists of fill-in-the-blank worksheets and Netflix, should they still have a job?","Correct-ish. Adjuncts could likely make more money doing just about any other career field if they were full time because adjuncting is not meant to be a full time job. At VCU it's far less than $40k a year because adjuncts are limited in the # of classes they can teach (because teaching more would require the university to pay things like health insurance, retirement, etc.) Nobody should be a ""full time adjunct"". Universities should do better by not relying on adjunct labor as much as they do, but at some point adjuncts need to drop out of the higher ed labor market if they can't get a full time job as a professor. Adjuncting should be for ABDs and grad students who are recently on the market, for professionals who teach very specific courses that focus more on specific professional skills than scholarship, or for retired faculty with PhDs. My previous reply was not meant to insinuate that $4.2k is a lot to be paid to teach a course; it's not and (in my opinion) students *should* be more upset at the # of courses they're taught by adjuncts (like the OP). But it's still quite a bit more than the $3k somebody cited, which should be pointed out.",2025-02-02 09:01:16,3
comment,"If a university professor’s entire class structure consists of fill-in-the-blank worksheets and Netflix, should they still have a job?","Agreed on all that. Some (many?) universities have no problem giving adjuncts 3-4 classes a semester, plus summer. Varies by university and department, but I absolutely agree it's terrible. I've had one good adjunct. It was a technical course and he was from industry; very clearly he's made all the money he needed, but I appreciated his rigor and hands-on experience.",2025-02-02 09:06:18,5
comment,"If a university professor’s entire class structure consists of fill-in-the-blank worksheets and Netflix, should they still have a job?","40k if you're teaching 10 classes a year, which basically no adjunct is/ can do even if they want to. And if you're a student in a class of an adjunct teaching 4 classes per semester, I'm sorry for you. But most adjuncts are probably teaching 2:2, as are the professors who are considered full time for that effort. So the adjuncts take home about 16k per year. Obviously they have other income, like teaching at a CC or freelance or waiting tables, etc. But saying adjuncts should drop out of the job if they can't get it full time job is pretty silly sounding to me. It would wreck VCU and would lead the lecturers away from the career they want and in some respect have, even if it's not very renumerative. It's like saying teachers should stop teaching at public school if they don't get paid more and go into education administration or another industry. Such a sad solution. The school can just alot more money to teachers. If they don't, they will go on strike eventually. And it will be very costly for everyone--students, adjuncts, and the school. And yeah, the school will probably ""win"" negotiations like they did last time, but they're shooting themselves in the foot, I think. The adjunct/grad student strikes are happening all over the country, school by school. VCU is just kicking the can down the road.",2025-02-02 10:23:31,2
comment,"If a university professor’s entire class structure consists of fill-in-the-blank worksheets and Netflix, should they still have a job?","I'm going to assume the first half of your post is directed at somebody other than myself, since it just repeats what I said and I agree with your math. But I absolutely think that ""career adjuncts"" should not be a thing ... I consider those to be the adjuncts who consider the job as professor to be an important part of their identity because they have PhDs but were unable to land full time work, and so they rely on teaching multiple courses to help make ends meet instead of getting a regular full time job in a different industry. Fortunately, we don't generally have these types of adjuncts in CHS, but I understand they do exist in other units at VCU. Still, there is an over-reliance on adjuncts to teach courses that ideally would not be taught by adjuncts. You're right that this is because VCU views it as a more cost-effective way to staff their courses, but that really just makes adjuncts a fancy word for ""scabs"" in many cases (again, I think there *are* times when using adjuncts to staff a course are appropriate, but they are limited). (Also, I refuse to accept the narrative that fully staffing departments with highly qualified full-time faculty is what would ""wreck"" VCU and not some of the other decisions that are made by upper-level admins that prevent them from appropriately staffing their classes).",2025-02-02 11:19:56,2
comment,"If a university professor’s entire class structure consists of fill-in-the-blank worksheets and Netflix, should they still have a job?","Yeah I was talking to the person above you for a bit there. And I feel like I agree with most of the things you're saying. I guess I'm just saying, adjuncts are not choosing to be ""scabs,"" they're forced to be scabs. Plenty of the adjuncts are fully qualified to be full-time faculty, but VCU decides not to staff them accordingly because they can, because it's cheaper and they don't have to deal with tenure. There's intentional scarcity in the ""professor"" market to force folks to take adjunct spots in the hope that they accumulate enough experience to get the tenure slot some day. I realize that's not the case really with the ""career adjuncts"" but it's the case with many of us. Some people want to live in Richmond, and teaching is what they want to do, and there aren't many other alternatives. VCU is comfy with this set up. As for the decision that admins everywhere tend to make that I think is flawed, it is hiring more admin instead of more faculty. I also don't really know what I'm talking about here. Just venting as much as anything",2025-02-02 13:26:49,2
comment,"If a university professor’s entire class structure consists of fill-in-the-blank worksheets and Netflix, should they still have a job?","Yeah, I appreciate all that. As you point out, it's definitely not the case that there's a scarcity of qualified PhDs to be hired into full time academic positions; it's completely manufactured by higher ed because they know they can. I suppose it's easy for me to say that they should stop teaching when the university will only hire them as an adjunct (if the university is trying to take advantage of them b/c of the manufactured scarcity), but I've been fortunate enough not to be in that position. Our unit is very fortunate to have some excellent adjuncts who can offer students some of the access to the ""real world"" that the academics on faculty cannot, and to have some excellent retired PhDs who just want to teach a course per semester to stay ""in the game"" a bit (not necessarily for the money). We've also made a number of questionable adjunct hires out of desperation over the years simply because we don't have enough full time faculty to staff them ourselves. That's a bummer for the students and waters down the value of higher ed in the eyes of the public. We have politicians who want to undermine and dismantle higher ed; it makes me mad that sometimes the threats are also coming from inside the house!",2025-02-02 14:04:30,3

comment,"FINALLY, they add symptomatic testing numbers to the Dashboard. And they don’t look good.","If you're getting a positive test rate over 30%, you aren't testing enough people, the virus is spreading out control, or some combination of both. Covid-19 has a number of symptoms that overlap with other illnesses, especially when the bounds are extended to mild versions of different symptoms. So, the overwhelming majority of symptomatic people who get tested for it *should* receive a negative result, indicating that their symptoms are likely due to something else. A positive test rate of 5% is often used as a threshold that we want to stay below, though even that is a little lenient. A positive tests rate of 31.8% is leaps and bounds beyond that somewhat lax threshold, so they are limiting who they are testing or a crazy number of people have it. Either way, not great. Note that for symptomatic people, we use 5% as a somewhat arbitrary threshold.

comment,Athletic Department and COVID -,"As someone on an athletic team, we are required to wear masks in closed spaces, not allowed to hang out with other teams/people, cannot eat in restaurants, have to wear masks when in huddles, warming up, after practice, in cars, and whenever we congregate around a space, we all have individual water bottles, equipment, and other necessary things that used to be communal. Have daily checks and frequent covid tests. We have a bunch of rules you dont see or dont know. You are at a higher risk of expulsion and have a ton of guidelines. We probably are collectively more safe than going to walmart. Masks are mandatory except when physically active outside on a field/when directly preforming strenuous activity. We wear them when working out indoors. So youre wrong and just keep it to yourself next time. If youre concerned about getting covid then stay inside :)",2020-09-02 11:26:56,4

Moonflower claims all their jewelry is homemade, but many of their products are from AliExpress/Wish/etc and are being resold for wayyy more money than you can buy them online. I can't promise this is true for all of their products, but since I've found many of them to be able to be purchased for under 10$ each on wholesale sites, it is probably true that most, if not all, are not homemade. If that isn't a problem for you, of course feel free to buy from them!

post,Who else has burnout?,"Who else has burnout? I do not feel the energy to do anything academic anymore. And it sucks because I really need a strong gpa for graduate school in my desired health profession. Canceling spring break was so dumb. I know they did it bc of covid reasonings but it ended up being unnecessary. And in the email about reopening in person classes because virtually learning impacts our mental health and learning success, it only benefits a small proportion of students. If they cared about our mental health they would’ve gave us a virtual break and kept classes online. And when we relay this issue to professors and ask for some leniency on assignments, they dont care and continue to pile stuff on us with full expectations like multiple students havent told them that we’re suffering.

The class had just been started, and no one was speaking really. All of us students are still being let in through the waiting room when someone does start talking. ""I fucking hate this class. This professor is horrible. This is such a fucking bullshit class."" The best part is we had a guest speaker who chimes in ""We can hear you."" No reaction from the teacher, or guest speaker other than that. The student then promptly exits the meeting. That is my mildly exciting zoom experience for the year. Any more you all want to share? Edit: a word",2020-09-14 15:14:36,74
comment,What are your zoom stories this year?,"One of my zoom lectures got somehow got “hacked” by a troll last week. For context, this class is a hybrid course that meets two days a week where half the class comes in person one day and attends lecture on Zoom the other day. Our class is wired with speakers and microphones in the ceiling so anyone that talks on zoom can be heard clearly by the entire class. Anyway, I was there in person that day and everything seemed normal at first. However, a couple minutes into class, “WHAT’S UP, UGLIES?” blared out from some girl over the speakers and we all burst out laughing. I don’t remember exactly what she did, but she continued to interrupt several more times over the course of the lecture and it quickly became annoying. She even started blasting WAP over the speakers at one point. My professor, to his credit, stayed pretty calm and kept either muting her or kicking her out (not sure which since I wasn’t in the Zoom meeting), but she kept coming back under different names. Apparently, my classmates on Zoom were even arguing with her and asking her to leave in the Zoom chat. Eventually, during a lull near the end of the lecture, one of my classmates on Zoom decided to call her out over the actual Zoom meeting and told our professor what name she was using. She basically admitted it and then proceeded to try and accuse one of our classmates, who we knew was actually in the course, of being a hacker/troll as well. I don’t know if she decided to leave on her own after that or my professor found a way to permanently kick her out, but that exchange was the last we heard of her. When it was clear she was gone, my professor just remarked, “too bad she doesn’t actually want to learn about spectrophotometry” and then proceeded to finish the lecture. After class, he emailed out new, password-protected Zoom links for the next lecture.",2020-09-14 16:27:12,27

comment,To the girl I saw in Coliseum Lofts today while touring,"Lived at Coliseum Lofts for two years when I transferred to VCU (2019 - 2021). We had one of the 2bed 2bath loft units directly in the front of the building (it was actually the top unit right above broadway wireless). While we didn’t really have issues with our specific unit, there were quite a few issues with the building itself. First, management team in the leasing office changed about 4 times while we lived there which made things difficult. My BIGGEST issue were the laundry facilities. There’s 8 washers and 8 dryers and at least half, if not more, were consistently broken or gross (mainly from misuse by residents). Not only were they pretty expensive but the payment process was very inconvenient. They were supposed to accept debit/credit card but that hardly ever worked so you had to purchase the laundry card and the machine did not take coins for loading the card but the prices were like $1.29. We never had an issue with roaches in our unit but we did have a lot of house centipedes (evidence of roaches elsewhere). I did see waterbugs (still technically roaches) in the hallways and elevator from time to time. Building security was a joke half the time due to broken FOB scanners and I went to do laundry one day only to find a homeless man sleeping in there. Friends also had to deal with another homeless man sleeping in the stairwell to the parking garage. Said friends lived in one of the back units facing the alley and they had quite a few issues with rain water leaking in from the roof. The parking garage is also a NIGHTMARE as there are support beams everywhere and tandem parking spots. Every single one of us managed to scrape our cars on a pole at some point. All this being said, you get what you pay for and you certainly won’t find any better for the same price. Unfortunately, all of the apartment buildings in this city at that price range are going to have the same issues. For instance, the iron house apartments next to coliseum are even worse from what I’ve heard and don’t have parking.",2025-08-04 22:44:23,5

comment,To the girl I saw in Coliseum Lofts today while touring,I have not lived there but I almost did about 2 years ago and the reason I backed out was because they did the random roommate draw and I was in the units basically set up like a dorm so you are like a couple feet from your roommate ( I was very desperate) and I don’t recall there ever being a gender selection and they put me in a room with a guy who was way older than me and when I brought this to the leasing office attention they just told me that there is nothing they can do and I was lucky and was able to sublease it and it worked out but that alone put a very bad taste in my mouth also the reviews were horrendous,2025-08-05 01:41:05,3
comment,To the girl I saw in Coliseum Lofts today while touring,"DONT LIVE THERE management is horrid and switched like 3 times in the one year we were stuck there. they lied about the place we were getting, and put us in a unit with a support beam in the middle of the bedroom and the only 2 windows were right in front of a wall. view was legit a wall. no sunlight. horrible. elevator was always broken. also the key fobs and doors barely work anyone can get in. we came in to a homeless man in front of our unit on the third floor. homeless people stayed in the stairways, we saw mattresses and garbage, and there was piss on the stairways every week. never got cleaned, also found a rat in the washer. parking garage was even worse. pls dont 🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻",2025-08-06 13:14:08,3
comment,To the girl I saw in Coliseum Lofts today while touring,"I lived there in 2018-2019 and rented a 2B/2bath and it was fine and had no issues. Then rented a studio and my unit smelled so strongly of cigarettes but other than that no issues. Laundry was annoying because people would leave their stuff in for hours and then would get pissed if you moved it. I was once working out in the gym and thought a guy was just resting when I realized he was homeless and was sparking up a full blunt. The management team when I was there was good but I’m almost positive they’re gone now. Every apartment has something. I live in one of the “luxury” apartments in Scott’s Addition and maintenance did drywall work in my apartment without putting down any sort of covering so everything got covered, missed several spots of work, the elevator is constantly out (typical for rva) and management has been horrible about responding to my emails.",2025-08-04 23:27:19,2

comment,To the girl I saw in Coliseum Lofts today while touring,"I lived here for a year. The best part was this woman named CJ who was my landlord but she got fired. There’s cockroaches and it smells pretty bad but it’s livable. I had no windows like many others have mentioned, but I didn’t really mind. I kinda liked it for sleeping in. Some other apartments are super loud sometimes though, mainly on weekends. It’s good if you really can’t afford better, but there’s definitely better if you can afford better. You get what you pay for",2025-08-05 15:55:16,2
comment,To the girl I saw in Coliseum Lofts today while touring,"The roaches can get ridiculous even if your apartment is clean or empty, and the hallways frequently smell of pet waste. The elevator breaks every few weeks, and the parking garage is very tight, especially when the trash piles up from one wall almost to the other. The washing machines are filthy due to the amount of pet hair and mold, and trust me, I’ve asked for them to be cleaned. Overall, it’s a place to live. From what I heard, you get roaches anywhere you go in Richmond, and living on Broad is an amazing experience for both the campus and easy access to nightlife and great food. Neighbors can be very nice and utilities are included, in the end I couldn’t find much better for the price but let’s hope that changes when the lease is up.",2025-08-05 16:19:13,2

comment,anyone else really bad with online classes?,"It's helpful to find a workspace and consistently go there with the mindset to get stuff done daily. Don't do your homework in bed, it drags on and you'll get distracted. A desk, good (or preferred) lighting. Make sure it's comfortable so you can get into the working zone. I can't concentrate if I'm freezing so at home I have a mini heater under my desk but in the dorms I just wrap up in a blanket at the desk. Fill out a calendar/agenda and work to stick to it. Give yourself awards, if you complete this, this ,and this then you will treat yourself to a cookie today or an episode of some show you like as your break before going back to work. I've been in online school since the 4th grade through my first semester of college, so I have a lot of experience of what does and doesn't work for me. Yeah it takes a LOT of self discipline but once you get down a routine, online will feel easier than in person at times. Being in a classroom does have advantages with giving motivation and structure but when you go online, you have to create your own motivation and structure your work yourself. Things will get better, if you work and have a positive attitude you will adapt faster.",2020-08-31 04:45:06,9

You can use this to look at reviews and get advice on courses you're interested in, as well as filter courses by department and level and compare these courses. You can also sort courses by difficulty, usefulness and the overall rating from reviews made by other students. I think if enough people start using it regularly. it's going to be essential when you're choosing your electives or just to get advice on courses you will be taking and know what to expect. Please let me know if there is anything that I should change or what features I should add. Lastly, filtering and sorting courses is only gonna be useful and accurate if there are a lot of reviews, so please go ahead and leave some reviews to courses you've taken or are currently taking.

post,Childhood Cancer Scammers,"Childhood Cancer Scammers I know this post is a little late, but better late than never I guess. You may have notice this week on campus these volunteers on campus working next to these blueish-green tables for an organization called the American Children’s Cancer Benevolence Fund. If you do some simple research about them, you’ll find out that they are actually a **scam organization.** What these volunteers will do is that they will come up to you, sometimes going as far as to block your path, and ask you a trivia question like “name a state that begins with D.” No matter how you answer, they will then switch the conversation over to the organization, and then pressure you into making a minimum donation *two hundred dollar* donation. If you say that you don’t have the money or that you’re in a rush to get somewhere, they’ll get really aggressive with you, and have even said to some people things like “oh so you don’t care about kids with cancer.” If they manage to successfully convince you to donate, there have even been instances where volunteers have been seen taking pictures of people’s credit cards behind their back, which if that has happened to you, then you should put a credit freeze on your account ASAP. While it is not fully known where the money actually goes, considering the ridiculously high “minimum” spend and the lack of evidence that they actually do support kids with cancer, it is safer to assume that this is a scam. It is very disturbing and angering that these types of people are taking advantage of students on campus. They will also sometimes instead appear as an organization called the ASDF, which is an “autism organization” that also uses the same scam tactics as the ones they use for ACCBF. I don’t know why VCU has been allowing them to be on our campus for so long, as they have been popping up for years. Nonetheless, please spread the word, and please stay safe out there. Thanks y’all.",2025-02-05 23:15:58,73

comment,Childhood Cancer Scammers,"Because VCU is a public space, it's not that easy to simply kick an organization off of the property unless you have some sort of proof to share with the VCUPD and Administration. Unfortunately this group seems to have been able to register as a non-profit, but then again so do most Bible thumping Televangelists and those can be some of the scammy-ist people on the planet. That being said, people like this are looking for the weak and no matter how many times you say ""No"" they will keep persisting. The best thing to do is walk away from them, if they keep trying to stop you you need to escalate it to ""Fuck Off"" and if they keep insisting you up it with ""Unless you want Mace in your Face, Fuck Off"". For many of us, being this crass doesn't come naturally, which frankly is a good thing, but it is something that you all should practice with your friends for *when* you run into something like this in your life, because you will.

Even if they're using the money for charitable purposes, the scammy fundraising techniques are terrible. I've seen posts about them on other college campuses, as well, and it seems like they try to take advantage of college students. I'm embarrassed to admit that they did get me once. I agreed to talk to them thinking that I could at least take a brochure or give them a $5 bill (charities usually take small cash donations), they tried to get me to give them a large amount, and I ended up giving them a smaller donation against my better judgment. They tried to get me recently with that ""Name a state that starts with \_\_\_"" opening, and as soon as I said I couldn't give anything, the person completely lost interest in me and pivoted to someone else. It was almost funny how obvious it was that they were just looking for a mark.",2025-02-06 22:59:20,5

post,Vaccines Mandatory for Fall Semester,"Vaccines Mandatory for Fall Semester VCU announced today that vaccines will be mandatory this fall, and must report their vaccination status by July 15th: Vaccination Vaccines are now widely available and have proven to be some of the safest, most reliable and effective vaccines in history. Public health experts tell us that vaccination is the best way to help keep ourselves and our community safe. • For the fall semester: Vaccination will be required for all students who live, learn, work or will be on campus for any reason (excluding those with religious or health exemptions). Survey results show strong majorities of students, parents, faculty and staff support this requirement. Students attending fall classes must report their vaccination to [University Student Health Services](https://health.students.vcu.edu/immunizations/submitting-immunization-records/) **no later than July 15**; Health Sciences students and those taking summer classes should receive and report their vaccinations sooner, if possible. Students who receive a two-dose vaccination must report completion of both doses. This requirement will allow our students to safely learn, live, gather and experience college at its best. For more information about full vaccination, documentation requirements, religious and health exemptions, and vaccine manufacturers, see the [student vaccine FAQ.](https://together.vcu.edu/faq/student-vaccine/) • Students who receive vaccination exemptions must follow safety guidelines for their health and for the health of our community, including but not limited to: wearing a mask, routine surveillance testing, completing daily health checks, and continuing to follow public safety measures including quarantine procedures. Entry Pass requirements will apply and entry will be allowed if the proper public health measures are followed. • Vaccinated students are exempt from masking, daily health checks, surveillance testing and quarantine requirements. [Entry Pass requirements](https://together.vcu.edu/public-health-measures/entry-pass/) will continue to apply; however, your Entry Pass will default to a green check. If you have not yet received your COVID-19 vaccination, you can make an appointment on-campus through University Student Health Services or at a provider near you (search vaccine availability at www.vaccines.gov).",2021-06-07 11:52:20,71
comment,Vaccines Mandatory for Fall Semester,Hurrah! I would have been really ticked off if we didn't require vaccinations. So many college students spread covid too much last school year so it would be nice to feel safer this year and end this pandemic faster,2021-06-07 11:56:37,41

And if they are living in housing, they will be kicked out of that as well. Currently there are ~450 students who have not reported their status and haven't gotten an exemption, so if you're one of those, you better get hoppin' because a reckoning may be comin' like at VT where they gave several students the boot...",2021-09-01 20:37:48,69

comment,Already sick,You can go to CVS minute clinic and get tested for flu and Covid. There are cheap antiviral pills for both with insurance. There is Tamiflu for flu and Paxlovid for Covid. Tamiflu needs to be started 1-2 days after symptom onset. Paxlovid is a little more forgiving and can be started up to 5 days after symptom onset. You likely have Covid since there is a massive uptick in our community right now. Paxlovid binds to an enzyme in the Covid virus preventing it from replicating. This allows your body time to clear the virus and there is a reduction in symptoms within 24-48 hours. Much better than waiting it out.,2025-08-31 06:33:01,1

comment,"VCU to require anyone covering their face on campus to show ID, among other policy changes","Actually for the last 10 ish years. Any student must provide ID on demand of a VCU admin.

Edit: I should clarify any student masked, non masked is required to show ID apon demand from a VCU administrator. This requirement is not subject to the VCU police. Virginia is not a show your ID state. This means that, in general, you do not have to show your ID to the police if they stop you without a warrant or probable cause.

comment,"VCU to require anyone covering their face on campus to show ID, among other policy changes","You have to look at the state code: 18.2-422. Prohibition of wearing of masks in certain places; exceptions. It shall be unlawful for any person over 16 years of age to, with the intent to conceal his identity, wear any mask, hood or other device whereby a substantial portion of the face is hidden or covered so as to conceal the identity of the wearer, to be or appear in any public place, or upon any private property in this Commonwealth without first having obtained from the owner or tenant thereof consent to do so in writing. However, the provisions of this section shall not apply to persons (i) wearing traditional holiday costumes; (ii) engaged in professions, trades, employment or other activities and wearing protective masks which are deemed necessary for the physical safety of the wearer or other persons; (iii) engaged in any bona fide theatrical production or masquerade ball; or (iv) wearing a mask, hood or other device for bona fide medical reasons upon (a) the advice of a licensed physician or osteopath and carrying on his person an affidavit from the physician or osteopath specifying the medical necessity for wearing the device and the date on which the wearing of the device will no longer be necessary and providing a brief description of the device, or (b) the declaration of a disaster or state of emergency by the Governor in response to a public health emergency where the emergency declaration expressly waives this section, defines the mask appropriate for the emergency, and provides for the duration of the waiver I would say covid 19 is a reason to rock a mask. https://health.students.vcu.edu/about/updates/covid-19/ Per VCU website Does it matter what kind of mask I wear? Use the most protective mask you can that fits you well and that you will wear consistently. *Choose a high quality disposable mask or a well-fitted cloth mask with at least 2 layers (3 layers is better!). Review CDC recommendations to maximize the fit and effectiveness of your mask.* That seems to be good enough for "" or upon any private property in this Commonwealth without first having obtained from the owner or tenant thereof consent to do so in writing"" I'm guessing there is half a dozen other things with the VCU letter head to say ware a mask.

post,I say we ALL e-mail Rao and demand an explanation of his $$MILLION+ SALARY,"I say we ALL e-mail Rao and demand an explanation of his $$MILLION+ SALARY Someone suggested a template which I didn't consider in my pop-off rant this morning SO I WROTE ONE (feel free to edit or not use): Dear President Rao, In these unprecedented times of economic uncertainty and social instability, the exponential rise in university fees and tuition is felt by students everywhere. However, VCU stands out from other universities for a multitude of reasons, not the least of which is the staggering disparity between your salary and the hard-working professors, adjunct and otherwise. Professors with multiple degrees in their field make a negligible fraction of your salary, despite the fact they are the ones who cultivate the good name of VCU within the classrooms you merely profit from. You have consistently been the highest paid state employee and among the highest paid employees for well over 5 years as you saw the financial burden on students double in university fees alone, alongside an almost 7% tuition increase. You stated yourself to be a steward of public resources and trust, and I ask how you justify the financial decisions you have made in the name of bettering our education with our money in your pockets. A concerned student, xxx &#x200B; OG post: President Rao is absolutely decimating this university. Tuition has soared since he took charge and literally all of it has gone into his pocket. There is no reason he needs over a MILLION dollar salary in addition to a $25,000 bonus last year that took place behind closed doors. I say we all e-mail him ([president@vcu.edu](mailto:president@vcu.edu)) and demand an explanation for why he is putting students in debt to line his own pockets.

You are by no means the first group of students to protest Rao's ridiculous income, and how tone deaf he is in his ""sympathetic"" announcements about raising tuition. While I was in school, a group of students were given audience in his office ""to show he cares"". He listened to them as well as Trump listens to people making an appeal, and nothing changed. You could see the man thinking about where to go for lunch while the students expressed their concerns. Rao is a prick, but he always comes out on top.

comment,I say we ALL e-mail Rao and demand an explanation of his $$MILLION+ SALARY,"First: Send this email to media outlets. Somebody outside the university system has to hold President Rao accountable if we want this to change. Second: Has President Rao taken a pay cut before pulling money from merit aid funds? Has VCU taken away financial aid? Was that decision made by VCU specifically? I didn’t see anything, but was there ever an email talking about losing aid money? Third: If VCU has been pulling funding from merit and financial aid without notice, absolutely speak to this effect this has on people who can afford to attend VCU BECAUSE of the aid they receive. People from less than rock solid socioeconomic backgrounds or who have been laid off because of the pandemic could really be suffering from this and might have to ask themselves if they can still afford to continue in higher ed because VCU has suddenly pulled funding from aid programs while the president is still sitting around a million dollar salary. Fourth: Yes, VCU froze tuition for this year, but that call was made BEFORE the pandemic; not because of it. If something is going on, and it can be proved, make it an open letter to President Rao, the VCU community, AND media outlets. It’ll have greater impact too if there are links to other articles/newsletters or something that can back up what’s going on.",2020-06-16 12:57:09,9

comment,VCU in talks to buy $275 million research building from Altria,"So, this will be interesting to see how this plays out. The $275MM is what the building and property are assessed at by the city, and it is unlikely that is what VCU would pay for it for a few reasons including that the State would cover part of the costs and Altria may further offer the property at a discount as things like this look good when their lobbyists visit elected officials to get their agendas passed. Additionally, as part of the VCU Master Plan Sanger Hall, which was built before VCU even existed, is slated to be replaced because while it had some renovations to its lab space in the past 10 years it really is inadequate for research purposes in these modern times and to replace it now would probably be between $600MM to $1B due to the increase in construction prices over the past several years so this potentially could save the school money by not having to build something new. And while there is lab space peppered throughout other and somewhat newer buildings on the medical campus, most of that is outdated as well. Having updated lab space can attract and retain researchers to the school as well as the grant money, IP, and patents with it which is important for a research institution. While VCU's Master Plan has several other big projects on deck and purchasing an existing research building would likely save VCU money in the long-term and solve an immediate need, I think they need to focus on a more pressing matter and that's housing, because it's becoming harder and harder for students who can't get into the dorms to find affordable housing near campus...",2024-10-03 12:26:53,23
