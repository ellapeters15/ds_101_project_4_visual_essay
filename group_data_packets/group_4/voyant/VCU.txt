VCU Health suspends gender-affirming care for those 18 and younger RICHMOND, Va. (WRIC) — Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) Health and the Children’s Hospital of Richmond at VCU have suspended gender-affirming care for patients under 19 years old in the wake of President Donald Trump’s executive order that cuts federal funding for such care. The following statement can be found on the Children’s Hospital’s webpage on transgender services as of Thursday, Jan. 30: "VCU Health and Children’s Hospital of Richmond at VCU have suspended gender-affirming medication and gender-affirming surgical procedures for those under 19 years old in response to clear guidance from the state provided to VCU. We are committed to ensuring that we’re always delivering care in accordance with the law. Appointments will be maintained to discuss specific care options for patients in compliance with the most recent guidance.” This move would make the Richmond hospital one of several that’s put such care on hold as healthcare facilities consider the impacts of Trump’s order, according to the Associated Press."

I feel bad for VCU and their patients. I feel for the most part their staff do not agree with this but because of funding their hands are tied.

I’m both a student at VCU and a patient at VCU health for HRT. My preferred name (not legal) was removed from the portal and now my deadname is everywhere there. I’m over 18, too. This is so frustrating and seems like it should be outside of what’s mandated by the EO (which isn’t even law yet???)

I know there are other posts about this topic. However I thought I'd post it useing a more "reputable source" that provides more information. The more you know..

If a person is legally an adult at 18, why are they included? Granted, the goal is eventual no gender affirming care for everyone.

most people don’t seem to know what gender affirming care actually is so i’m not surprised. i didn’t know what it really was either until i actually shut up and started listening to other people when they spoke.

Obeying in advance This is how fascism wins

Only 1,377 days until November 7th 2028 and 1,451 more days until January 20th, 2029... ...sigh...

Look, if gender affirming care is going to be removed then men can no longer take Viagra or the likes as it's affirming their gender.

Wtf why is everyone just rolling over to Trump’s demands?

Capitulating to fascists never works out well.

People *will die* because of this decision.

What a nightmare. You should hear some of these kids having their appointments canceled. We’re (older trans folk) trying our best to talk them off a ledge, because as things currently stand they don’t see a future for themselves and aren’t sure they can do this anymore. Because our government is able to bully hospitals into refusing what is deemed safe and medically necessary care by every major medical association in the world. I won’t despair, but damn this is bleak. Kids will die.

There is no law requiring them to do this. And Executive Orders do not apply to state and private entities.

Everyone must first remember Virginia is a Red State controlled by a Republican Governor who is doing everything on earth to buddy up to Trump in order to worm his way into his good graces after being removed from office in 2026. You must also remember first and foremost MCV/VCU is a Capitalist POP business that puts **P**rofit **O**ver **P**eople. The is the very definition of the a Capitalist POP economy that currently dominates America that both the Republican and the Democratic parties in America support 100%; an economy dominated by Big Pharma and the ~~Wealthcare~~ sorry I meant to say the Healthcare and Insurance industries in America controlling our economy. Don't let anyone fool you, this is all about big money influencing, ~~Wealthcare~~ damn I did it again, Healthcare decisions in America.

I thought this wasn’t happening though?…

What!?! I thought this shit wasn't happening?! I mean the under 18 part.

So, I need someone to check my logic here but I do have an issue with how these articles have been worded. They seem to imply all gender-affirming care is halted, including counseling and other resources. My understanding is that only surgical procedures and medications are halted. While I agree that it's wrong and deserves all the outrage and attention, it seems somewhat irresponsible to communicate that ALL services have ended when people may have otherwise sought them out.

Were they really performing sex change operations on children?

Huge win for society

2 weeks in and America is already healing

It should be noted that VCU (university) and VCU Health (hospital/health system) are separate entities at this point.

Once you are an adult you can have and pay for what ever elective procedure you want.

So would this allow the hospital to have one less thing to worry about. The hospital deals with a lot of peocedures so wouldn’t this be a good thing? By definition hospitals are meant for to provide medical care for people who are sick or injured. Would this allow the hospital to focus on others mediacals procedures.

Long over due

Fucking love to see this.

And this is what winning looks like

Children can’t consent to chemical castration. Good, and shame on anyone who supported this

Wow, what in the world has this gotten to. You’re telling me undeveloped children are not able to take such drastic actions. By god, I just can’t believe this, almost as if children should be children before having access to these absurd changes.

Palestinian American Student & Dad: 200 Relatives Killed in Gaza; VCU Withholds Diploma for Protest >Virginia Commonwealth University is withholding the diploma of a Palestinian American student because of her campus activism. In a hearing Tuesday, officials examined the case of VCU student Sereen Haddad, who was told she would not receive her diploma at her graduation this year because of her participation in a peaceful memorial commemorating violent police arrests at a student encampment for Palestine in 2024. Sereen Haddad is the daughter of Tariq Haddad, a cardiologist who grew up in Gaza. Dr. Haddad made headlines last year for rejecting an invitation to meet with then-Secretary of State Antony Blinken because of the Biden administration’s support for Israel’s actions in Gaza. The Haddads have lost more than 200 members of their extended family in the nearly two-year-long assault. >[Democracy Now!] speak[s] to the duo about the repression and retaliation that Sereen has faced for her student activism as she awaits a final decision by the university on the conferral of her degree. “Whatever VCU decides, I have made peace with the fact that I don’t need a university who is materially invested in a genocide’s approval,” she tells Democracy Now! “I am on the right side of history, and I don’t need a university to tell me that.”

Disgraceful VCU leadership. Zionist have far too much power over American institutions. Remember, 38 states have anti-BDS laws.

Sereen is one of the kindest and most genuine people who goes to VCU. It is a shame that admin treats her like this for standing up for the human rights and dignity of Palestinians.

Violation of her first amendment right to free speech. Fuck Glenn Youngkin and his capitulation to Israel. Really hope the commonwealth wakes up to Israel using Epstein to control the GOPedo.

Super disappointing to see VCU take the side of genocide.

Don't forget that Israel has free healthcare including legal free abortions.

spineless dogs

It seems that VCU issued a ban on sidewalk chalking after a student group used the tactic to raise awareness about VCU’s involvement supporting Israel during the apartheid/genocide. The student gathering she took part in resulted in no arrests. It was a gathering of less than 150 people on a lawn on campus that the university encouraged for informal gatherings. https://rvamag.com/politics/palestinian-american-students-diploma-withheld-by-vcu-story-goes-global.html

No one receives their diploma at graduation, it's mailed afterwards. Was she told it would be completely withheld?

That’s crazy they’re doing that. On a side note: 200 relatives? I can barely muster 10

Muslims don’t practice usury. The financial enslavement and destruction of any society that practiced it. The Middle East is the start of western civilization, they are ahead of you and don’t care what tribal faith you are. You can be Muslim and anything else you want. The Roman Capitalist Church & Loan Wild West civilizations are slaves.

How does someone have 200 relatives? If your grandparents have 10 kids, and each of your aunts/uncles also has 10, that only gets you to 100?

Ooof maybe do not protest in favor of a terrorist organization.

200 relatives? That’s kinda nuts. How tf do you have 200 relatives?

And people act like NOVA is open minded. On a college campus no less.

Wouldn't have happened under the Harris or Biden administration... Just sayin'

Wow. That’s one unlucky family. Perhaps they were all in Hamas

200 relatives 😂

I didn't watch the interview. Do they explain how so many of their relatives in particular have been killed? It just seems statistically odd for 50k out of 2 million to have died, and this one extended family losses 200.

“Don’t need a university that is materially invested in genocide” ok well the purchase of your phone and clothing contribute to slavery. Just a rich kid wanting attention for being morally superior to everyone else

What are the 12 that don’t?

…And for her family

GOPedo and Libtard rapist. This is not a partisan issue. They are all scum.

What genocide? Haven't seen anything that meets the legal definition of genocide.

And Gazans stone and kill women’s and gays.

[From the May reporting, VCU stated](https://www.wric.com/news/local-news/richmond/its-absolutely-absurd-vcu-withholds-degrees-of-several-students-over-pro-palestinian-gathering/): >Please note that while you are eligible to participate in commencement activities, your degree will not be officially conferred until the pending student conduct process has been fully resolved. The conferral of a degree is contingent upon the completion of all academic and institutional requirements, including the resolution of any outstanding disciplinary matters.

Consider if you include great-grandparents (4 generations) and don’t forget they also have siblings. The fertility rate in Gaza is closer to 3-4 but it used to be above 6 in previous generations. You can calculate family size by the formula: (fertility rate)^(number of generations to consider) While 3^4 is only 81, 4^4 is 256 and 6^4 is 1296 so you can see how quickly fertility rate increases lead to much larger families.

She wasn’t protesting for the IDF.

You’re getting downvoted, but for real? I have a HUGE hispanic family and let me tell you those catholics pump out babies. Still does not even come close to reaching that number, so I’m not sure if it’s exaggerating the distant family aspect or if there’s a cultural difference I’m not grasping.

VCU is not in NoVa though...

Almost like the actual death toll is far higher than 50k

Yes the 200 dead family members is just attention seeking

So one should have absolutely no morals unless they adhere to all morals completely? You are what is wrong with humanity.

and you sound like a rich kid(or former rich kid who is an adult now) who never learned empathy or about standing up for others or making moral choices. must be nice to have nothing stopping you from focusing solely on your own wishes but most humans aren't quite so self-focused.

Oops. The UN definition of genocide has been met. Happy to see your response that recognizes the reality. Love when people learn. https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2024/11/un-special-committee-finds-israels-warfare-methods-gaza-consistent-genocide

You want to be a pedant, then the onus of definition is on you. How do *you* define genocide, where did you get *your* definition from (cite sources), and why do you feel that Israel's destruction of Gazan people, territory, infrastructure, government, and culture fails to rise to your definition of genocide? Be specific. Cite examples.

Try reading the news.

being worried about definitions and not deaths, real cool guy

Your shit talking points are about a year out of date.

everyone is an uncle, which is something I'm sure you can relate to. This is kind of a weird nitpick

I don't know. I have 200 relatives, for sure. My Christmas card list is longer than that. Just with siblings, first cousins, nieces, nephews and aunts and uncles (direct aunts and uncles -siblings of my parents) I can come up with 50 or more, easily. And we haven't even gotten into grandchildren, great-aunts and uncles, or second cousins yet.

Just like everything coming out of Palestine, take the real number and multiply by 10-20. The jew haters don’t need proof so they just run with it.

Straight up went to ancestry.com and tried to find everyone down to 10th cousins.

Is this area safe?

I had some classes in whiterun. Until I took an arrow to the knee.

ask long as you watch the skies, traveler

I got launched to Jupiter by a giant there, I’d be careful if I were you

The area was fine until the storm cloaks came along.

the entire map is fucked

Someone stole my sweet roll there

Watch the skies, traveler.

I saw a mudcrab there the other day. Horrible creatures

There be dragons.

Very dangerous, a giant and Lots of mudcrabs

You’ll be fine traveler. Just don’t bring yourself around if you’re a Khajiit.

You’ll be fine if you watch that fire!!

You’re not talking about the Cloud District are you? Of course you’re not.

Please stop

Hither and yon

Be careful, whiterun has a notorious thief on the loose, they steal sweet rolls. They’re very dangerous. Granted if you’re in the cloud district you should be fine… what am I saying of course you’re not in the cloud district, keep your head on a swivel.

Whiterun hold has a lot of lurking giants. Would t recommend.

Its safe if you stay far enough away.

Tons of daedra, would avoid.

Only once you’re Thane, then they stop fuckin with ya and give you free shit.

It’s always safe where the white run

Yeah but I heard there was a Dragonborn around there?? Super wack idk

not for whites and kahjit

too many Nerds... i mean nords 🤓

not if you color'ed 😝

It’s safe, but if you whiterun.

Ugh same thing happened to a buddy of mine. He was a really avid traveler too but he just kinda stopped after the incident.

Speaking of Khajiit, stay away from this cat named Maiq. Can't trust one fuckin thing he says.

i feel the same way lmao

College is the most isolating and lonely experience you will ever have Hi. I’m not blaming VCU, as this would undoubtedly be the same in any college I would have happened to go to, but college in general is so destructive on mental health if you struggle to make and maintain friendships. High school is easy. Make a friend in a class and hang with them every day, as it is forced. College you can vibe with someone but you will likely not see them out of the club or class you met them in, and once that class ends for the semester, you can kiss that friendship goodbye. And thus you are left empty, feeling like you’ll never have close friends. You’ll always be left out, the odd one out. This is just an extreme rant and I hope it isn’t removed. I needed to get it off my chest. I’m so sick of being alone.

Please be civil to others in the comments. Helpful suggestions like joining clubs, going to events, suggestions to VCU discord groups, what's up groups. Tips and ticks of how to makes friends are appreciated! If your looking to meet new people! Check out https://thecommons.vcu.edu/how-we-help/vcu-ramsconnect/ You can look up clubs to join and go too [here](https://vcu.campusgroups.com/club_signup)! You can see events going on [here](https://vcu.campusgroups.com/events)

I don’t understand why this is being downvoted… There’s countless other VCU students who feel the same way. Check the VCU parents facebook page.

Hey dude, I can definitely relate. Making friends as an adult can be very challenging, especially now when all we want to do is stare at our phones rather than make conversation. Your feelings are 100% valid. The only advice I can give is to try and really put yourself out there. Invite your classmates to study session, make small talk with your classmates, etc. It's hard but eventually you will find your herd. Good luck!

I had a very similar issue when I was at VCU and took me a while before I had any semblance of friendship. Unfortunately, this is an even bigger problem once you graduate. I would highly highly recommend going regularly to some clubs or other activities on a regular schedule. I started talking to one person I didn't know each day, even if it was only to compliment their shirt. You're gonna have to work hard if you want out of this scenario. I hope you start feeling better and meet some people soon.

Hey pal. I went to VCU from 2013-2017. My freshman year was just like this. I even spent a weekend on MCV in the mental ward after trying to unalive myself. I was miserable. So miserable. But then I joined some clubs I liked. Made some friends. The best friends I ever had in my life. I started to really enjoy my studies. Made even more friends in my major. I had friends everywhere at this point. I created a club. Joined a frat (I’m a girl so it was academic). College bloomed afterwards. I don’t say this to brag. I say this to tell you: hold on, it gets better. You will find your place at VCU, I know it. It’s a magical school that has a place for everyone. I miss it and Richmond dearly. The happiest times of my life came right after the worst. I’ll be thinking of you, fellow Ram. Sending you lots of love.

I needed this so badly right now. No one ever taks about how fucking isolating it is seeing everyone else have friend groups and close friends and people they can confide in and still trying every piece of advice people give you and STILL not be able to connect with anyone. I’ve been crying over this all week and opened reddit to rant about the exact same thing actually, so just know you’re not alone and theres solidarity (if you ever want to hang out too feel free to pm me 😭💀)

In my fifth year of undergrad and I relate. I have made absolutely no friends that I have any kind of regular contact with. I had people in my classes that I got along with, maybe we exchange social media, even get boba or something after class a couple times - but that was rare. Idk if it’s a lonely time in life or what but my only super consistent friends/socialization in college have been my roommates & partner. I’m pretty outgoing and friendly and still struggle to maintain any kind of social life. I thought it was a me problem so I’m glad to hear that at least I’m not alone in it lol.

Yeah I feel you on that. I was at a different college before I came to VCU and I actually dropped out because of the loneliness. Now that I'm at VCU I'm trying really hard to meet people so if you want to hang out or talk or something then feel free to dm me.

VCU isn't one of those college towns where its the middle of nowhere like Harrisonburg (JMU). A lot of people who attend VCU are from the surrounding counties and Richmond itself, and those students were already friends from high school.

I think it's easy to feel isolated, but plenty of other people feel similarly; I just moved to Richmond recently and it's felt pretty isolating, especially since a lot of people already seem to have established friend groups. Hope things improve over time and you can make some good friends oncampus!

this happened to me in college except i had no close friends in high school and was expecting to make them in college but yeah it was a huge disappointment. now im in the army 😂

I'm currently a VCU student with a full time job and courseload. I have lots of friends, and a few close ones that I met here so this is what I would say from my experience, especially as someone who doesn't really socialize often: • join VCU discords (there's a discord feature that lets you browse VCU servers), and just talk to people there until you find someone (or multiple people) with similar interests. I'm a CS major so it's very easy for my classmates to have all sorts of nerdy hobbies we bond over. • look beyond the traditional college experience for places to find friends. You mentioned meeting people outside of school at clubs and stuff but honestly I've never been to one. Pick up new hobbies and make friends there. If you make a friend in class ask them what they do for fun and do those things with them. As an adult, friendships take investment because if everyone is busy, they are going to prioritize what's best for them (and rightfully so), so if you make yourself an asset to your friends (because you're a good person, or because you've particularly connected with someone), that definitely helps motivate them to want to hang outside of class, and outside of the semester • Reach out to friends you had in class even when you don't have class. This is as simple as checking on someone if they talked about doing something at some point in the future (hey, how did x thing go?). Shows you're interested and you care. Make sure to actually get some contact info (group assignment is a good excuse to get phone numbers or other means of contact like discord usernames or social media handles). Once you have contact info, the onus is on you to try to connect! Not everyone will be consistent enough to hit you back (some people are very flaky), but do it enough times someone will feel cared for. • think about what YOU look for in a long term friend, and be that for other people. We aren't as unique as we all tend to think we are, so someone else probably feels just like you do. This is a good example of when empathy is important, because understanding someone is a great way to make them want to invest in you back.

I’m sorry dude. I was the same way while attending and just started getting out of my shell when the pandemic hit. What helped me was just getting out into town. Study at some different coffee shops and look for event by bell isle. There are always nice people there to talk with. That being said as “inclusive” as VCU tries to be, it really is just a fad to get incoming freshman in. Once you signed your tuition check they could honestly care less. I wish they would actually focus on fighting that instead of battling it at surface level. Ralph is all about those dollar bills

At risk of giving too much information about myself. Honestly I think this may just be a VCU experience. I graduated from VCU but had attended JMU for two years before transferring. It was very easy to make friends at JMU, there was a huge sense of community and the university really pushes it. I felt like the clubs at JMU were better developed and supported by the university. I also think that there was way less to do Harrisonburg and so it kind of forced the student body to develop an internal community. VCU was the complete opposite. I found the student body I guess less friendly. There was less community building from the university and the class sizes are a lot larger than what I experienced at JMU. It became easier to make friends when your classes are small. There are also way more students at VCU just in general. I found getting a job (well I had to to pay for bills) at VCU was where I made friends with coworkers. But I felt the same way as you do at VCU. Granted I was 3-4 years older than my classmates and while it doesn’t seem like a huge deal but there is a big maturity difference between a 22 year old and an 18 year.

Do you not have a roommate?

I made some casual friends when I was at VCU thru study groups. If you have any classes where a big exam is coming up, just blurt out one day if anyone wants a study buddy in the library. You'll make a friend and learn the material more in-depth all in one felt swoop!

I definitely experienced this in college. I didn't make most of my good friends until my senior year, when I took smaller classes! If your major has huge lecture-hall style classes, they can seem nearly impossible to meet anyone in. Seconding and thirding what others have said - clubs, intramurals, saying hi to someone new each day. Maybe try Bumble BFF, or the VCU page for your class (there's usually one for each graduating year). When I made some good friends, everything felt so much better, and VCU truly felt like home. Senior year was one of the best years of my life. You've got this!

I think it’s happening on a lot of college campuses. Folks are isolating and that makes it so difficult to make friends.

I felt very similar for much of my time at VCU. Now that I look back, I find myself missing those times for how much easier it was (at least compared to life now) to make and maintain friendships. It may be more difficult and take more persistent effort than in high school, but I hope you are able to see that a fulfilling and engaging social life is very much within reach. Part of it is just learning how to nurture friendships outside of the structure high school provides. I can guarantee you that there are so many other students who feel the exact same way you do now. Hope you feel better and can start enjoying your time there.

College is extremely competitive as is, and esp at VCU, many people are from out of state so the isolation is enduring. It is also most definitely an RVA problem...they don't call it "the stoic city" for nothing. What are your interests, my friend? What do you study?

It sound like you are expecting the potential friends to do the work. Are you creating follow up hang outs when you meet a new friend?

Have you considered joining a club? A way to make friends is to actively look for them. Personally, I would recommend the dnd club. I have always had a hard time with friends. But, I was able to connect with some people though the club and play the game. You could also try out going to a support group or going to fitness classes with RecWell.

I made a ton of friends through intramural sports, if you enjoy them

Maybe reach out to other officers in other clubs and make connections that way? I know of some organisations willing to do collabs.

College is the most isolating and lonely experience *you* might have had… but not for others

relying on someone else to give you self worth is mad pussy. Genuine dick riding of the highest caliber

Don't worry they aren't worth knowing and most dropout so why would you want friends that are just going to beg you for money in the future?

I can definitely relate. I was commuting to campus for the last couple of semesters and basically had no interactions with people between or during classes since they were mostly lectures. Made some buddies during my lab courses but they cut off contact once the class was over. I pretty much spent the last couple of months sitting around at the Cabell Library to pass the time. So yeah I completely get where you're coming from. It's hard to make friends on campus.

i’m having the same problem too, i get it. my best recommendation is to try and be painfully outgoing. i’m a mega introvert and it hurts sometimes to do but it can be rewarding. find clubs and MAKE yourself go to meetings. it’s not fun at first but i’m hoping it gets better!

Don’t be afraid to deepen relationships with people. Ask them to hang out one-on-one. And yes, friendships do end eventually; but that’s part of life and nothing lasts forever. There are plenty of people who feel the exact same way you do.

I know it sounds ignorant but be uncomfortable. I used to be introverted up until 9th grade but I began high school in a new county, 30 miles away from my friends. I had to build up a system of friends from scratch, and it was fairly easy. Met some in the band, classes, clubs, etc. Then by the time of graduation I had more friends than I could count. One of my hardest struggles was having a mild stutter when I was younger. I chose to make myself uncomfortable by making small talk with literally anyone, from random people in my classes, to teachers, even to random people at the gym. This slowly became apart of my personality. As a freshman entering my second semester, it feels like I’m making more friends than I could count. In classes, clubs, gym, dining halls, etc. Even if you have a few friends you could probably get to know mutual friends. But I’m commenting to tell you to learn to make small talk, join clubs that interest you, and force yourself to be an extrovert

I transferred to VCU pretty late and felt like I was already behind, but one of the best things I did to make friends was join a club. I had to force myself to do so, as it was easier to just say “I don’t wanna do this and I’m gonna go home and play games”, but I’m really glad I stuck with it. I made a lot of friends through that that I’m still cool with today, 4 years later since I graduated in 2020

Sometimes I've thought about just putting a big TALK TO ME I WON'T THINK ITS WEIRD sign on my back. I take responsibility for making friends and try to put myself out there of course, but it can feel isolating always being the initiator. If anyone is reading this and wants to chat, dm me, I'm into a lot of nerd stuff, rap / local music, and I want to do more stuff in richmond this year!

That’s life my friend

Once you get out of general class studies you will have several classes with the students in your major. It's easier then, as you will collaborate on multiple projects with the same group. Hang in there.

Hi. I came to VCU in 2011 with 4 of my best friends from high school. I was from a small NW VA town where most people went to UVA/VT. Of those five, 2 of us finished school at VCU. There were a number of other factors contributing to the 3 leaving VCU, but one in particular began to lower her way and group once I joined Greek life in my sophomore year. I cannot emphasize enough to branch out at VCU and in the broader RVA community. Volunteer for habitat for humanity, participate in the ASPIRE or other learning communities, or find literally any other group who you are willing to meet with on a semi-regular basis. It is so incredibly important to just find people in college you like being around and who like being around you. You’ll always find your people if you look in the right place.

I’m sorry my friend. I can relate to the isolating and lonely times right now with u just in a different way and I absolutely did a rant tonight myself. It’s been a hard long January and people are struggling. I’am one of them. My situation is different from yours however. I moved in with a girlfriend from work and our other roommate who was already here (we share a 3 bd) and I thought I was going to have an awesome friend I have known for a few years now to hang out with and go have some fun with, heck maybe cook dinner together once in awhile. I got none of that. I moved an hour away from where my family and friends are to be closer to work and so my parents could have their place back that I was renting from them. Not only did my bills double moving to a city from the country my mental health and anxiety has taken a crazy turn for the worse. I feel like I can’t talk to anyone in fear of bringing them down with me. I feel guilty. I’am alone probably about 96% of my entire week as I only work part time right now. If you ever never someone to talk to I’m here! We’re in two different worlds but feel the same! I’m here for you if you need me! Don’t hesitate, you’re not alone friend! Better days are coming! Sending you a hug!- Allison

Heh, just wait til you get to the real world.

I would highly recommend joining a club that is based on your major! That way, you already have one thing in common with that group of people. Another recommendation that I have would be to, although it hurts, to talk to people in your classes. Create a groupme for your class and reach out to make friends!

I got really involved in my campus ministry and I found a community like no other I pray that anyone struggeling with that finds one to ✝️❤️

lowkey at this point I've learned that unlike everyone else I emit an aura that naturally dissuades people from even seeing me. comes in handy when I most of the time just wanna be left alone, but it does have drawbacks. never really made any friends as a kid, and now that adult friendships are magnitudes harder to maintain I just kinda gave up. in the end its us on the deathbed who's gonna be the only one dying. we all ultimately die alone anyway.

I heard what I think is a good tip for making friends as an adult. If you want to hang out with them outside of a club or class, ask them to do something specific not just get their number. So like “I’ve been wanting to try X restaurant. Want to check it out with me on Saturday?” That way the notion of friendship doesn’t get lost in the ether.

This is one of the many reasons I chose to go to a small school. A mere 1200 students 4,000 ft in elevation in the mountains. I hung out with all the same people, lived with most of the same people, had classes with most of the same people, saw the same kids walking across campus everyday at the same times, all in a variety of clubs. Size makes a BIG difference. I didn’t find college isolating much at all because I was always surrounded by people I was already close with from early on. Of course freshman and sophomore year tend to be worse but once I was immersed in the same 300 student pool for a year or two, it was a lot more like fun HS.

Hey dude, I don't know if you're still reading comments on this but I always encourage you to reach out to clubs to join, and sometimes the simple act of making friends with classmates can open a world of experiences. Its hard to make friends no matter what you are, but there are so many people rooting for you. I believe in you! You can do this. Much love.

🫂you can pm sometimes and vent if you need to.

Wait till adulthood…

I think it’s what you make it. You make genuine connections then it will last past your time at college. It’s after that is difficult, once you guys start, Adulting and having children, relationships fail.

College was absolute hell. I went to two different colleges, both very popular and both in different states. Neither of them totally cured this feeling.

That’s because you’re an adult. Making friends as an adult is hard. Childhood friendships are friendships of proximity, which is why most people lost touch with friends every time they move as a child, but are put into another situation where they’re in close proximity to a bunch of other kids pretty much instantly. If you want friends as an adult, you have to actively want friends, and try to find others with like interests. You can’t expect them to fall into your lap.

What's on the fb page, it's not viewable to public

Vcu health, wtf "we are committed to ensuring that we're always living care in accordance with the law" is such bs because this wasn't a law it was an executive order and they just decided to roll over because they'd rather have federal funding than happy/living trans children. I went through the whole process of getting referral letters, gathering all my documents, finding a surgeon and going through several appointments for nothing. 3 more years.

That seems like enough discussion for this post. Comments locked.

Bending the knee to ensure they don't lose federal funding. Never mind that there is literally a state law forbidding VCU from doing this.

I’m so sorry you’re having to navigate this OP.

Im sorry this is negatively impacting you. Please know how many people are supportive and want you to receive the care you deserve.

Wait under 19? Aren't 18 year olds adults, and capable of making decisions for themselves???

Please VCU is not the one to be blamed.

Complying in advance at the direct expense of their patients 🤡

I am so sorry. This is horrifying.

I mean… VCU Health has been on the verge of collapsing for the last few years. If they decided to not receive federal funding, they would 100% be shut down within months.

Lose funding or spend money fighting in court. Staying open seems to be the best option?

I’m so sorry- as a mom of a trans kid I am so angry for you and our community.

These people in the comments are fucking disgusting. This statement goes out directly to you hateful scum that think you know so much. Have you ever talked to a trans person, face to face? Have you ever even considered that a view outside of your own could actually be the morally right one? It's obvious the answer is no, based on the hideous comments I've read. There have been ZERO surgeries preformed on minors aged 12 and below, and the ones preformed on older teenagers are extremely rare and have only ever been to the chest. Hormone blockers are irreversible, you just stop taking them. HRT is NOT "False Chemicals," it is hormones. You know, like the ones that everyone has? There has been no "genital mutilation" to children. And have you ever seen post-OP, healed, GAS surgery? If done well, which in most cases it is, a person can look completely cis. No "mutilation" like you think. Trans people are MUCH happier after taking HRT because it's whats right for them. There have been MANY studies to prove this. For all you disgusting people who obviously can't think for yourself, I feel sorry for you. Sorry that you hold so much hate in your hearts that you can't see out of the narrow views you hold. Just because you don't understand something, that doesn't make it a bad thing. For those that are willing to learn more, I advise you to read this: https://genderdysphoria.fyi/en/printable

Stopped all future donations ashamed of my school.

Children should be children. Why do they NEED to alter their physical bodies at such a young age? You're doing incredibly unnatural things to a still developing body. Why should they not be close to adulthood to *make a choice that will permanently alter the rest of their lives*?? Why can they not just change their hairstyle, clothing style, and express themselves through makeup until they reach an age where they have more experience and a *literally more matured brain*? Instead of putting such a damn heavy emphasis on the genders of children, maybe we should focus on *teaching them life skills*. Where the hell are you people's priorities, seriously???? And its not banning people from getting gender affirming healthcare, its just putting an age bar on it. Like drinking and smoking, joining the military, watching media featuring the genitalia yall are so obsessed with. Please, explain to me the problem here, and tell me why chemically altering a young person's body is the most important thing here.

I could be understanding it wrong, but an executive order still has to be followed. It’s not a law in a sense because it hasn’t been approved by congress, but you can’t just ignore an executive order. “Both executive orders and proclamations have the force of law, much like regulations issued by federal agencies, so they are codified under Title 3 of the Code of Federal Regulations, which is the formal collection of all of the rules and regulations issued by the executive branch and other federal agencies“ - quoted directly from the ABA “Executive Orders state mandatory requirements for the Executive Branch, and have the effect of law.” - quoted directly from the ASPR, an official government website. Now if I’m understanding/interpreting these texts incorrectly, provided you have legitimate sources to counteract my interpretation, feel free to let me know because I want to be properly informed about this.

Why do you say 3 years?

The analysts on election night were like “why has t virginia turned blue yet?” This makes sense. We’re probably becoming a purple state now fml

It is actually entirely insane that anybody believes that a child should be exposed to gender swapping medication. This world is doomed.

How old are you and what surgery are you seeking?

Good , child abuse is sick and putting ideas into kids minds like this is also sick. Anyone who thought it was ok , you need serious help.

I fully support this. You can’t even buy a lighter in the state unless you’re 21. But you wanna give children the option to get surgeries to mutilate themselves.

realistically asking- what did you expect if they lose federal funding? it is genuinely terrible to see but you can't expect an institution to do that. it is just for minors.

Well I was planning on going back to the doctor that did my partial hysterectomy at VCU to finish the job, but now I guess I might not be able to. I'm over 19 but I am transgender, and mark my words that the ban on transition care will be extended to adults at some point. It already has, since 18 year olds are now barred from transition. But I certainly don't want them to get my money in the meantime, since they clearly value their funding from other sources before their own patients.

oh... oh thats where i get my hormone blockers from. oh...

UVA did the same thing. Clearly instructions are coming from the state government.

This thread has become littered with scum commenters who obviously don’t do their research on trans youth and gender affirming care. To any trans youth who might be reading this- please know that you will always find uneducated a**holes that pretend like they know everything when what they really know is snippets of Fox News… I mean, one of those a**holes even became president. Please know that if you are trans/gay/questioning- there are good people in the world that want the best medical care for you and are rooting for you ❤️

You’re under 18 and want to mutilate your body. This is a good thing. Stop crying. No one is forcing you to do anything, you’re not an adult and you can’t make adult decisions. Even if your parents are supporting this, if they are they need to be investigated.

Children don’t need unnecessary surgeries 🤷🏼‍♀️

If youre under 19 you dont have the mental capacity to decide whether or not you want a surgery Hot take but ill stick to it Hate me if youd like

Good!! About time common sense ruled the day!

Who cares shouldn’t be changing children anyway

Child mutiliation is never a good thing. Good news.

“Gender affirming care” = Cutting off breasts, Irreversible hormone therapy, Chemical castration, Cutting off testicles and/or penises, and more. FOR CHILDREN! Sick stuff.

Kids shouldn’t be able to chemically castrate themselves. Why is this such a controversial issue? Kids can’t consent, can’t vote, can’t drink, can’t smoke, can’t drive. Why on earth would they ever be allowed to get life changing elective surgery?

![gif](giphy|7k2LoEykY5i1hfeWQB)

If you're looking for the intelligent and sane comments, look for the ones that have lots of negative karma lol

Good. Leave the kids alone.

I call that a W 😂

Very good. I can't believe this is even a thing. Obviously not morally correct until they are old enough to make the decisions. I don't care what you do with your body, but LEAVE THE KIDS ALONE.

The world does not revolve around “gender affirming care” this is insane brain rot displayed by mental patients.

But I thought everyone said they weren’t doing this to kids?

![gif](giphy|7k2LoEykY5i1hfeWQB)

How do you think VCU will handle this threat from the president?

I don't expect anything to change at VCU because of this Truth Social rant.

This - assuming any actual policy is introduced on the basis of a random tweet - is a very straightforward first amendment violation. The rights to speech and assembly are constitutionally protected.

All those Nazis wearing masks and MAGA wearing masks are cool but against Trump? No.

Turns out wearing a mask is a revolutionary act??

VCU determined that the protest last year was “illegal” because of a suspected intent. VCU can and will say whatever they want. Rao has already spoken privately that he will work with DHS and ICE. He owes his job and recent 200K/yr raise to Youngkin

They will immediately fold and do whatever the administration wants, once it's an official act anyway.

The problem when protesting peacefully, is remaining peaceful, when the police aren't held to the same standards. They have no intention of remaining peaceful and they could care less about your rights as Americans. They intentionally make it hard to remain peaceful, when shooting flashbangs and teargas at you.

VCU has already shown that they are willing to give in to the fascist tyrant so I expect this to be no different.

Idk and I’m scared, I’m just very very scared. That’s all I can say rn. Screw everyone who made this all a reality

VCU retroactively changed the protest policy last semester to ban groups of more than 10, then enforced it as they sent riot cops after a bunch of people singing kumbaya. Rao has shaken hands with fascists who were at Jan6 and Charlottesville. VCU will comply in advance.

As long as protests are peaceful It's a person's 1st amendment right.

I'd highly doubt the riot squad is going to come down to vcu and beat ya'll down and imprison you or at the very least expell you from school for engaging in a peaceful protest at this current point in time. I mean don't go by me, I'm just some guy who has been alive a while and has basic observational skills, but this looks like one of the many scare tactic bullshit random statement tweets or whatever social media the guy loves and uses all the time and shitposts on. A lot of what he's saying, in general, he can't actually back up. His administration and even possibly him, know this, they're just using shit like this tweet to get you stirred up, even though nothing will come of it, and then you'll be looking "over here", while they do the real damage "over there." That seems to be the plan in general from where I stand anyway. Say a bunch of ridiculous shit, like what he's saying here, or the 51st state of Canada, both ridiculous and most likely won't happen, but it's a good diversion tactic for the mass public who doesn't really understand how things work, get them stirred up and waste their time worrying about nonsense while they make the real moves that'll put anyone working class or below down, eventually.... That's my take away from what I'm seeing here, anyway.

Fear mongering lmfao. Come and get me then

I don't think this will go the way he wants.

“Illegal protests” the party of the constitution everyone 👏👏

An illegal protest isn’t even a protest, does bro know what a protest means?

I’d like “illegal protest” to be defined…

VCU students will say fuck off to this administration and protest like hell

potus is such a fucking loser. he gonna come around personally to arrest people at all the universities across the country where protests are happening? last i checked, RPD can barely stop actual crime, let alone thought crime. this threat is just like potus, without teeth.

They're rolling over and complying with every executive order, so they'll probably also comply with this. They're the biggest hospital in the area. They don't want to lose their funding at. All.

VCU will roll over to beg for belly rubs and pennies. The school already updated rules to say masks weren't allowed before the fall semester started. VCU Health instantly dropped gender affirming care and only walked back on that decision after UVa did it first. Also Monroe Park belongs to the city, not VCU, so students can just assemble pretty much anywhere across the street from campus to avoid VCU rules. Idk how permits work and rules for assembly or protests in Richmond tho.

Michael Rao and VCU administrators are complicit in everything. I would not be surprised if Rao attempts to militarize VCU Police like he did in April with the encampment.

WOOHOO MAGA!

There’s a protest rn, right?

vcu has to much to worry about and constant tax increases to students every year

Ok well then that also means those "pro-lifers " that come to campus comparing abortion to genocide every year. You can't have it all.

What’s an illegal protest? Protesting is protected by the Constitution. Maybe he should have taken his oath with the Bible instead of showing his ignorance.

Donnie fat boy go back Mc Donald’s hoser

Freedom of speech flushed down toilet...unless, of course, you're a January 6th rioter.

Come on try it. I dare ya asshole.

He thinks he is actually a dictator a clown 🤡 ass motherfucker

Vcu will fold..they already folded on his threats about gender affirming care.

So, no freedom of speech then.

Define "illegal protests"

Didn't they already do this at VCU with the anti-genocide protests?

what is an illegal protest? what's the criteria?

No such thing as an illegal protest assholes

just dont destroy property, block traffic, support terrorism, assault bystanders or police, or threaten to kill anyone in the admin and youll be fine.

I know this is just a rant on truth social, however, I have to say.... why is a peaceful protest at a university a problem when you allow people to rush the capital of this nation! HEY TRUMP! THEY WEREN'T PEACEFUL WHEN THEY DID THAT, YOU JACKASS!

I’d say he’s trying to pick a fight. This isn’t strength, he is projecting pathetic weakness right now.

He says "illegal protests" but there are legal protests so just do them legally...

Stop allowing tweets to pretend to be laws. This is not the land of make believe, we need to stop giving this dummy attention

1st amendment

I guess it depends on what constitutes an "illegal protest".

Since when is it illegal to protest in this country

Easy don’t support terrorist and you have nothing by to worry about. Seems fair.

@ those who are partying at GRC

Fuckin' amen. It's not snitching when they're the ones fucking you over; that's absolutely your business.

I'm investing in this post at the moment I saw it because this is exactly what I see myself do if I catch anyone doing that. &#x200B; P.S. Thanks a lot GRC. You and your freshmen friends all put our semester in jeopardy. Prepare to face the consequences of your ignorance.

If you see this and you’re scared, you should be :) you know better than to come into college in 2020 expecting it to be the normal experience. Stay tf to yourselves, for the love of God

I’m in brandt and my suitemates keep having people over and it’s really starting to get on my nerves, not really sure what my options are

Please rat these mf out! I really we could all be back on campus now but here we are. The people who decide to put both the student body and the larger population of Richmond at risk just to have a good time deserve to be out of here.

Please for the love of god, snitch like you have never snitched before. I’m in medical and I refuse to get my clinical rotations canceled I need to graduate on time

u/Vredditdownloader

I will party all I want

Holy moly! what's Happening on campus? what kind of partying are we talking? I'm imagining 50+ kids hotboxing a dorm room

VCU shoulda done the unthinkable and *banned* freshman from campus, not encourage them to come lol. But then I guess no one would be there then.

go to the RA. they know they’re breaking rules and being shitty. they know. part of being an adult is taking responsibility for the effects your actions have upon others.

Try to talk things out with your suitmates. Explain to them that you're not comfortable with how many visitors they're bringing over. If you'd rather not confront them head on, I really think you should reach out to your RA in private. Explain the situation to them and ask them to intervene if the situation doesn't change. Don't be afraid or feel bad to call out your suitmates for doing dumb shit during a pandemic especially since it puts your own health at risk

But if they did that, what would happen to rao's paycheck? /s

Yeah I'm a freshman and I don't wanna go back home :(

Of course not, but enough of them are to where VCU is probably about to shut down and make everyone go back home. They’re the ones having parties on campus despite being aware that the US has over 170K deaths now due to the virus and that we’ve been in this pandemic for 8 months now.

VCU withholding degrees of three pro-Palestine student protesters

This is so anti VCU and so anti-Richmond. ‘97 VCU Grad here wondering where to send my diploma back to.

So 4 years, a small fortune, so much studying and VCU can just say "i don't like what you say" and hold their diploma?! Fucking bullshit, what a bunch of worthless shits. Free Palestine, fuck VCU

The title “VCU withholding degrees of three pro-Palestine student protesters” is misleading, as it oversimplifies and omits key context. VCU says the disciplinary action stems from violations of protest rules—not the protest’s content. Staff, security, and police approached the students multiple times over three hours, informing them the protest was in a non-designated area and instructing them to move to the nearby Park Plaza Amphitheater. Some students refused to relocate. VCU’s vice president explained that delaying degree conferral during unresolved conduct cases is standard, and most students receive their degrees after completing minor sanctions(like writing an essay about what they learned from the experience).

This is bullshit!

they better be so fucking for real right now

Do people understand Palestine is anti LGBTQ and Israel is pro LGBTQ? They kill you in Palestine for being gay, yet I see a lot of people who are gay in support for a country that wouldn’t allow them to be there and may even execute them. Don’t believe me? Just do a quick Google search.

"Give me my fucking money back"

Hey everyone, donate to the [Hind Rajab Foundation ](https://donate.stripe.com/cN228hbY5g7jaM84gg)and help holding Zionist terrorists accountable!

There is a lot to be mad about but this made me furious.

You can have my degree back. Please stop asking for donations VCU.

Sounds good.

Well done VCU.

Didn't get past the Times-Disgrace's paywall. (Is it still the typo-ridden mess it used to be?) Some thoughts. No one should be denied a degree based on exercising their First Amendment rights. I've seen it happen for disciplinary reasons, usually until there was an admission of the violation with or without mitigating factors and restitution if university property was damaged. Based on some of the comments, i think a lot of people are forgetting that Hamas is not all Palestinians, just as the Isreali government is not all Jews or even all Isrealis and the Trump administration is not all Americans. One can support an end to violence against one (ideally both) sides of the conflict without supporting those inflicting the violence. The attack by Hamas was horrible, but the IDF's bombing of refugees and preventing basic supplies like food, water, and medicine from Gaza is horrible as well. As we comment back and forth, we should focus on the facts of this situation and the 1st Amendment issues, not the geopolitical mess that spurred these students to protest. Just my $0.02.

VCU warned for 3 hours that they were in violation and did not seek authorization to do this event but then tried to accommodate them by offering relocating. I’m sorry but sometimes you bring it on yourself. I don’t necessarily agree with withholding degrees but seriously the students don’t pick their battles. They pick every battle. This could easily been resolved with alittle cooperation. VCU could have just said you didn’t request authorization or anything/kicked them out completely but the students didn’t want to compromise when VCU offered solutions.

Try not providing support to terrorists.

This is bullshit

They can take withhold the paper. 8 wonder what happens when you piss off the people who you armed with the knowledge...

People who support terrorists shouldn’t be rewarded with an award as prestigious as a college diploma.

It’s interesting because I would assume their view points on almost every major societal issue are in direct conflict with the vast majority of the people living in Palestine and certainly the ones governing it. Strange bedfellows.

If you support terrorism then reap what you sow.

Terrorists shouldn’t be able to get degrees anyways.

Are there supposed to be any protests about this? This seems like a very direct, very actionable cause to protest. If the right wants to argue about free speech then this is the prime example of it to defend.

imagine caring about a stupid degree while a genocide is going on.

Good introduction for them into the real world 👍 good on VCU

Probably the registrars office if you are serious. Pretty sure it’s an easy process. You already paid the money, they really don’t care if you have a degree or not.

Free Palestine from Hamas

maybe don’t trespass and assault cops? just an idea

Viva Israel!

Those pesky Zionists!

Are the Zionists in the room with us right now?

Thank you, the only reasonable comment in this entire thread.

no facts please, only zionists do that.

The non-desigmated area, which was moved after the fact and without notifying the protesters in anything even remotely resembling a timely fashion

Their children still don’t deserve to die

Google search brings this up? https://m.jpost.com/israel-news/article-845626

I think it’s very telling that you can’t understand “People don’t want them to be killed in the tens of thousands, even if they hate gays.” Makes me suspect you wouldn’t care about genocide against people who hate you.

You won’t do it

No Zionist gets a diploma, then. That's mostly Christians getting disqualified, btw

So… just because a region tends towards being less-than-progressive, we should just ignore them being BOMBED INDISCRIMINATELY?? 🤦🏽‍♀️

Indeed, if people have different opinions than you then you should wish genocide upon them... or some shit.

Very few truck-wielding MAGA terrorists finished high school, so you are good.

Can only care about one thing at a time. Got it.

This shop Extreme Pizza seems it has been closed for the past 4 years? It’s in a prime location too? How is this any profitable?

Wow I remember I ate there with my ex girlfriend probably 12-13 years ago and I remember the pizza was ASS

Probably just completely vacant. VCU has enough money to hold buildings vacant for sure. They have left the old club at 534 N Harrison vacant for years. After running out the owners of course.

It was too extreme for us...

One of my roommates who was a med student ran a killer scam on this place. Apparently you could submit pizza orders by fax, but allegedly the machine was in the back and rarely ever checked. So he would fax in a pizza order mid-afternoon, wait several hours till evening, then call and act upset that they forgot about his order. Every time they responded by either comping his order or giving him credit for a free pizza next time.

As someone who was class of 2020 and hasn’t been in RVA since the pandemic shut down the world, it’s wild to see that it’s been closed because I remember walking past there every day lol.

lived in those dorms my freshman year. Worst pizza I’ve had by a long long long shot.

If I'm remembering right, It's been closed longer. It closed after my freshman year, so 2018-2019. I think it closed around when Mansions did.

Oh hey I used to work there. Good times.

Why is VCU more concerned about buying Ipanema, when this and Noodles and Company have been shuttered for way too long. I don’t get it

it was ruined when they tried to add a drive-thru

I'm pretty sure this place closed over the Covid period. The campus was a ghost town for a looong time. The Waffle House didn't make it, either. Some of these empty buildings have major problems inside. Strange Matter had awful sewage issues and I'm sure that's why that space is still vacant It looks like the owner is too cheap to shell out to fix it, and I doubt someone with a lease would want to. There was a laundry on Grace and Ryland that closed for several years and I heard it was because the underground plumbing was fucked from years of lint. It finally became a vape shop because the plumbing was too fucked for a cafe or another laundry.

Got slices for a $1 here a few times my freshman and sophomore year. Was always ass

It was too extreme.

I would not be surprised if there is some sort of deep lingering damage to that building from when it was extreme pizza. My ex girlfriend worked there while we were at VCU until right before it closed and it was an insanely unmanaged place. The GM was a heroin junkie who would SA female staff, and people would smoke crack in the kitchen. Also from what I heard, the owner of the business would wack his Willy to porn in his office. With such lovely qualities, it would be unsurprising if there was some catastrophic mold or water damage in their no one gave a damn about for years until the keys were handing back the keys.

I think about their extreme Hawaiian pizza and immediately feel my hangover from 15 years ago

Boy did we tear that place up the first few years. Remember the original manager blasting lines in the office, got caught stealing by the owner who was his buddy from their college days, SA’ing the female employees. When the owner decided to stay open until 3am, thats when things really went down hill. Sooo hilarious seeing the cooks coming into their shifts w a 12 pack of PBR to store in the walk-in and drink throughout their shifts. And for all the og’s - gotta knock one back for Pedro. IYKYK

I worked at five guys next door to this for like 4 years. We would trade burgers for wings and pizza lol. Simple times simple pleasures. I oddly miss their shitty wings

Man, I remember going there back in 2007-2011. Good memories there, wild to see that it's just rotting and vacant.

This is where they trim cannabis. It is a front

Extremely closed

hubby used to go to vcu I will let him know the "paper pizza place" seems to have closed ... I always wanted to try it out but hubby said it was ... different.

Compared to Christians, Extreme Pizza was some Extreme Garbage.

probably a tax write off, claim as a loss when really just not willing to lower price.

The pizza was too extreme

My parents and my sister and I loved going here im so sad that covid shut it down:( so many good memories

Went there once at like 2am. Got pepperoni and broccoli. Gordon Ramsay level creation

If this is the location near the Seigel Center (sic)...this location closed I think either late 2018 or early 2019. From what I understand/remember them saying...there was plenty of crazy stuff that happened there cause the college crowd that went there would, on the regular, would break things, get into fights, etc and have to be thrown out. This might have contributed to them finally shuttering the place. It was always pretty busy regardless though. Source: knew at least 2 ppl that worked there for a few years, one of which was a manager

Were the pizzas extreme ?

4 years… in other words, the pandemic lockdown led to the end of business for this place, just like many others.

TIL Extreme Pizza isn’t just a Bay Area thing

Worked there when it opened in 2006. I remember walking past and there being a box for paper applications and it was stuffed to the brim. Great times there in those early years. The owner was one of the best, too. He also owned the Great Wraps across from Lowe’s which I feel has been gone for even longer than this spot.

We used to eat there a couple times a week when I worked in Scotts addition, damn.. this brings back some memories. That was around 07-09 range I think..?

The pizza sucked. I got a burger once because I knew it was crap. The burger was garbage too.

dang its been since 2018 since I was there, reading these comments I never knew so many of these places i passed by everyday arent there anymore. one place im still shocked still exists is village cafe. i guess its the novelty of it, but my god ive had the most overcooked pasta and mediocre pizza there

California style Pizza, not very good

I remember working off W grace street and seeing this place. Memories. Also always saw a rockstar energy drink truck guy handing out drinks for free.

It’s sad Covid killed a lot of people and also businesses

Graduated from VCU in 2016. Every time I go back to visit, which is a rare occasion, I’m always shocked at how pretty much the same VCU and Richmond still look to me. I was actually at a rave show last year in Richmond and saw some familiar faces from my time at VCU lol. It’s weird, but ever since all of my friends from VCU left and moved out after graduating, Richmond just doesn’t have the same vibe for me anymore whenever I visit. It used to feel like home away from home. Now it feels like a foreign place I used to know lol.

Homeless guy in doorway won't allow any new business to open.

The crust wasn’t the best, but I liked some of their specialty pizzas

I remember ordering from this place and asking for a drawing on my box, they drew a game of thrones reference where tyrion shot his dad. By the way, I would suggest Assantes, they barely survived the covid slowdown and the owners are incredibly good people.

The world wasn’t ready for extreme pizza

I don’t know how they stayed in business so long. I recall giant slices for $1.

Extremely Crappy Pizza

Must be pretty extreme then

That's extremely harsh observation

Did to ask that homeless person for permission to take a picture or did you just say screw it?

VCU students walk out in protest of visa revocations: ‘You need to protect the students’ "VCU says privacy laws prevent the university from sharing additional details, but they aren’t currently aware of recent immigration actions involving faculty or staff. In Friday’s statement, leaders said any student who may be feeling anxious or uncertain about the change can seek assistance from TimelyCare and University Counseling Services."

EDIT FOR CLARIFICATION: This is an opinion based on the LOGIC that the behavior of ICE seems like they have information about a students hour-to-hour scheduled. If there was a link, or proof, of this happening it would be a national news story. Hope that clears up what I mean. Original comment: This is my take, ICE has been on campus two days that I know about in the past couple of weeks. Both times they drove to a specific building, entered, and then left. That seems like they knew it was likely someone would be in that building. And that information is stored in personal google or apple calendars, and in eServices. It is totally possible that google or apple is giving up that information about someone’s schedule, but I imagine it would be easier to pressure VCU. I believe it is the latter. Rao has gotten so much cover from and had their 70 million dollar mistake forgiven by Youngkin. It is highly likely that VCU admin is providing ICE with student information.

Thats their pitch for everything. Go go TimelyCare and CS, but see the other side. Beyond corrupted, accomplices.

Kids… VCU is an profit driven institution. They only do good when they can write it off. They don’t pay taxes and own half of Richmond city proper … soooo what did you expect? The White House is trying to shut Harvard out of 2 billion for allowing protests.. VCU wants to keep funding to buy more of Richmond

Really proud of these students for standing up for their community. It feels pretty brave under the circumstances.

Remote out of state student here. Proud of y’all.

It would be Harboring a Fugitive to lie. The school is funded by State and Federal funds. We don’t have to like the law we just need to Follow.

Do we know if the students are safe or where they are?

Blow up the Dean’s phone. Figuratively people!!!!

Unacceptable to yank students who are freaking here LEGALLY🤬🤬🤬

If the student is here illegally then the government has the right to know. Look up the definition of what illegal means.

Google & Meta tax software companies to steal/sell taxpayer information without taxpayer awareness. Search Senator E.Warren investigation Google & Meta, Turbo Tax, Tax Act, taxpayer information, privacy (sorry I don’t recall exact title). The report was issued in 2023 but is referenced in Inspector General reports, too.

But hey, they care about our privacy. Honestly I have had enough experience with Rao and VCU to not question if someone said there was collaboration, because VCU has denied me Title IX hearings and the ability to press criminal charges against known fascists who had assaulted me, their gleeful declaration of being grandfathered agains the ADA, shitting on homeless students, rewarding bigoted plagiarists, etc.

Just purely out of curiosity. It might be me missing it but on those occasions that ICE entered the classroom buildings did they actually remove a student? They may have been checking for presence of a student in order to see if they were violating student visa rules. Which would be pretty rich since it seems that musk did the same.

Spoken like a true coward

Wow! What kind of bigoted plagiarism did you see at Vcu? Fascist assaulted you?? Can you tell us more

no one was grabbed that i saw, what i saw twice was that ICE rolled up made a round and then left. Peak, oh I thought this person would be here.

it wasn’t a dorm building, it was classrooms

Yeah sure thing, I'll totally spill my guts to some likely alt who twists words into inanity like 'bigoted plagiarism'.

Thanks. I’m wondering if it is a check to see if they are there when they “should” be.

That doesn’t really change anything they said, DHS still has that information because a student visa is required to enroll into a college as a non US citizen. Also, unless a subpoena was issued, it’s unlikely Apple released anything, they may get hate for their phones but Apple is really secretive with their data which is what makes them not that bad

??? That’s YOUR phrase I was quoting… I don’t understand why you wouldn’t want that information to be shared. Are you ok?? Honestly that is the worst attitude you could have.

it could be. still sus and very heavy handed

class schedule is not typically shared with governments

Lmao idk. Makes me think someone is a drama major. Literally quoted them…saying the most outrageous accusations and then gets mad when asked about them. Unhinged.

That was not the phrase I used, I said "bigoted platiarist", not "bigoted plagiarism". Big difference. And you've been trolling in other subs.

I think we realized who the problem was 😭🙏

I’m not saying that it’s not. It is definitely a big increase in resources for enforcement.

No, but they know the person is here, on campus. Not that hard to find someone with that information, even in spite of our campus being fairly large. And it actually could be, to qualify for the FAFSA you need to be enrolled in a certain amount of credits. I imagine quite a bit of your info here is the education department also sees.

Oh you’re stalking me? Weird. Semantics at best.

they would still mean VCU is granting access to a students schedule as FAFSA is separate from scheduling classes as it is done the year prior before fall and spring registration. Like what are you even arguing about? ICE is not going from building to building, each day (they were here today again) they parked at one building and went into that building and left.

Those letters matter a lot, obvious alt. "bigoted plagiarism" would imply the plagiarism was bigoted, while "bigoted plagiarist" would imply the plagiarist was bigoted. Words have meanings.

You seem to be missing some information as to how the FAFSA works or you are MAJORLY oversimplifying it… yes you fill out the FAFSA before the school year starts, but that doesn’t mean your aid amount is already determined. It is simply so that they have your information and can get the process done quickly. You fill out the form and they process it, using the information provided, they get a number of how much aid you qualify for, dependent on how many credits you plan on taking, but they don’t post that information yet because they don’t know how many credits you’re taking. So they send the information to VCU, or whatever college, to figure out how much aid you will get. VCU, or whatever college, will then send the requested information to the department so they look at it and determine exactly how much you qualify for. Then they, essentially, give VCU the monetary amount of aid you qualified for and say, hey, this money is for this student to cover a portion or all of their tuition. Your comment makes it sound like you fill out the application and the department sends your application to the school and then their job is done and the school decides how much aid you get. When it comes to the PELL Grant and other federal/state aid. VCU can’t control how much of it you get, the government does. So of course VCU gives them your schedule, because how else would they determine how much aid you qualify for?

If there is an order of removal Leo's can lawfully get any info necessary to remove them. You seem to think this is a game.

Ok, you’re right. So what was being plagiarized that was rewarded? I would love to know with no weird motives I promise

HOW WOULD ICE GET THE STUDENTS SCHEDULES WITHOUT VCU'S INVOLVEMENT. you both are being intentionally obtuse.

Based on your comments so far I don't know if you really have "logic" so much as a suspicious willingness to forgive everything as long as it's an authority.

Fairly regular plagiarism of my work in engineering and art by people who actively did not want me to thrive based on my demographics. People would regularly listen to what I said, repeat it, and take credit because nobody was listening, then when I'd call them on it, they'd make fun of my accent.

I don’t think any law enforcement or the government needs help or permission accessing information in any scenario.

Well international students do have to provide proof of enrollment for the terms of their visa. That includes which specific courses and sections theyre taking in a semester which basically is their class schedule. We don’t know the exact reason why those students were specifically targeted by ICE. For all we know they could’ve been taking under the required minimum of courses they should be or they’re taking more virtual vs online classes or they never resubmitted a document they were supposed to or something much worse. If VCU is involved I wouldn’t be surprised if the extent was them just confirming information that the student already agreed to share.

VCU Health denies transgender child services with mother being told VCU no longer offers those treatments.

Update: VCU will no longer provide gender affirming care or surgery for individuals under the age of 19 https://x.com/bradkutner/status/1885094370254168323?s=46

students should take this as VCU will also comply and provide names to ICE

Damn. This breaks my heart.

My personal feelings aside I can see the necessity of bowing down to the people in power right now. The feds are looking for excuses to cut off funding, and according to other posts in this subreddit VCU is already in debt. What is the alternative?

VCU health is a huge non-profit that serves the majority of the indigent population of Richmond. If they lose funding, even if only temporary, the entire city is going to suffer big time. I can't blame them one bit.

This is so disgusting tbh. Gender affirming care saved my life. It's really not complicated. We need to leave these decisions up to parents, therapists, and doctors. Government needs to stay the hell out of people's medical business.

Good. They shouldn't be doing this shit for kids. Let them make the decision when they are adults. Kids don't have the ability to fully comprehend the decision. I feel like now you have deranged parents who force this on their children almost to make them like a trophy because they are such a great parent for having and accepting their trans child. Sad.

Wait until your an adult

Does this include cisgender male teens who make up the bulk of breast reduction surgery?? Almost like this whole fucking administration is a goddamn joke whose sole purpose is to hoodwink Christians into thinking they’re actually making the country better?

Good, and that’s not being hateful despite what reddit thinks. I don’t care if people wanna be trans, I really don’t. But there needs to be a line drawn at some point. We won’t let a kid get tattoo until 18, can’t drink until 21, can’t smoke until 21. Can’t join the military until 18. We don’t let minors make major life decisions until 18. Kids constantly change. These decisions are not reversible and will affect them for the rest of their lives. Let’s start to use some common sense again.

This is a good thing and falls within lines of other countries who reversed their policies on this practice after realizing how damaging it is. Good move VCU, may not be popular but it’s needed.

They want us to die

Good. Children shouldn’t be exposed to such life altering and risky procedures before they even understand the potential consequences. If you ask me, that’s child abuse.

Conflicted. Personally, I agree with trans rights, but I also don’t like the idea of below 18ers being able to have surgery/HRT. Puberty blockers are fine. That being said, the denial of this opens the doors to MUCH worse things.

A step in the right direction. Good work Virginia

No surgery under 18 I can agree with. Meds... we give underage girls hormones all the time for various issues, so it shouldn't be wildly different for trans kids. Although the rumors I've heard of female gymnasts being given puberty blockers makes me kind of queasy.

this is heartbreaking.

Funnily enough, I spoke with someone from admin after the state of the university today. When I tried to push them for an answer on whether they would cooperate with ICE and immigration officials to detain VCU students, faculty, or staff, he said "We will follow the law and do as we are instructed." So yes, they absolutely will cooperate with ICE if requested by the government.

As they should. Why wouldn't they?

Well ICE right now is preoccupied with deporting thousands of people who actually have violent records (murderers, rapists, gang members, etc) that were for some reason not deported.

VCU certainly isn't in debt, they have the second largest endowment in the state, $2.72 billion. *

Easy to say when you haven’t already lost some of your critical healthcare access. Your logic can justify so much submission to fascists. Defeating this nonsense is about nipping it the bud, and not conceding any ground to transphobia and hatred.

if every single organization stands down to the person in power, you’re right, they have no choice. if they choose to stand up, they can stand together and organize. it’s literally called unionizing; and the loss of labor history and labor culture in this country is a huge part of why we are where we are. if enough orgs stood together against this shit? they could make him stand down. he’s a bully, and bullies respond when people make them listen by banding *together*.

And the wording of their abortion ban is similar. I guarantee, they are going to pull funding from any institution that offers abortions. This will be an insane overreach by the Executive branch and hopefully we won't stand for this (same with him dictatorialy making treats of pulling funding if institutions aren't following his will). This is not the job of the president. He's also made it so the family off military members can send their kids to private and/or faith-based schools in gradeschool and college, all taxpayers funded. This is not the job of the president. Most of his EOs are him attempting to write law and ignore the will of the people in Congress. People in those red states will need to raise hell.

Use the dozens of lawyers that VCU/MCV has on staff or under contract to push back in the courts? Use the slow walk of bureaucracy to at least get your currently scheduled patients treated and give some warnings out to the rest. Instead, VCU/MCV jumped straight to the front of the line of compliance. The optics of this is that VCU/MCV is completely on board with denying children medical care and seems all too willing to click heels and hop-to.

Except trump doesn’t actually have the power to stop those funding. The executive branch does not have the power to decide how to spend congress’ budget. His EO is an overstep and will be challenged in court. VCU prematurely bending to them is cowardice and despicable.

“First they came for the transgendered, and I did not speak out…” We all know how this story goes. This is American, even if it sucks we don’t compromise on any of our populations. That’s the message they should be getting. Not “ah well, it isn’t my problem.”

Go educate yourself if you’re going to comment, but the typical maga bs doesn’t fly anymore.

So you think 18 year olds aren’t adults? They’re banning care for 18 year olds as well.

Be excellent to each other.

And yet 18 year olds are also banned from gender affirming care, despite not being minors.

Gender affirming care is not just surgery. It is also access to counseling and puberty blockers, which are safe and have been used to prevent precocious puberty in cis children for decades. Blockers give kids more time to understand their feelings before making any choices, and they are a good option for some people. Do you really believe there “needs to be a line” drawn by the government about something that should be between a patient, their parents, and their doctors?

You're extremely misinformed. These are not life altering surgeries, they're life SAVING treatments done with the knowledge and consent of the child's parents and doctors. Decisions about whether only social transition is needed or whether the child should take puberty blockers and HRT are not made quickly or rashly. These practices have been going on for decades without controversy until anti-trans sentiment got ramped up for political reasons. Mind you, the points you made don't stand or aren't comparable when you remember that this is HEALTHCARE we're talking about here, not bodily harm like with smoking or going to war, and in Virginia parents CAN consent to giving their child a tattoo and drink alcohol at private residences. Hormone therapy and puberty blockers ARE reversible by the way, and the majority of children only go thru social transition, but the ones that need puberty blockers to alleviate their dysphoria are just as valid for needing them for medically necessary reasons as children who need them to prevent a harmful precocious puberty. Stop falling for right wing talking points and actually get educated.

access to gender affirming care reduces suicide rates of trans youth by [73%.](https://www.hcplive.com/view/suicide-risk-reduces-73-transgender-nonbinary-youths-gender-affirming-care) does access to tattoos, alcohol & smoke also save lives? no? guess we’ve found a false equivelance. you know what decision isn’t reversible? suicide.

Amen!! This is a decision that needs to be made by a responsible adult with life experience and a better idea of who they are. Not the decision of a child whose brain has yet to fully form.

My thoughts exactly!

That's not what gender affirming care is

AI slop in the commons Kinda just a rant because like. What. Vcu is literally known for their art programs and I'm 100% sure that a student would LOVE to paint a mural or even just draw a print by hand... There is no need for VCU to be lazy when they make thousands of dollars, not to mention it's a bit daunting to see VCU put up AI slop as an art student??? Like oh yeah. VCU we're gonna pay you a ton of money for your art program and you get to rub it in our faces that you don't even gaf abt your artists (not that we didn't know that anyways, you put us in the shittiest buildings that are either falling apart or not actual teaching spaces)

I noticed that too! I have no idea why they didn’t use an actual artist. Especially since there is a mural right next to it.

This is really irritating. I also noticed that VCU recently rebranded the Junior Rowdy Rams to the Rodney Ram Club, and I'm pretty sure the logo was AI-generated, especially given that the character in the logo looks nothing like Rodney the Ram. VCU used to have an incredible graphic designer to do things like this. https://preview.redd.it/8unrmfo1s1kf1.jpeg?width=1109&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=549aa57d70a7943e935b48353a2296960911fe4a

I think VCU is making a bit more than thousands of dollars 😆

imagine the vcu staff actually paying one of the art students to make something to hang up🤯🤯🤯

vandalize it

it’s one of the main reasons why i didn’t commit to VCU, their art program now allows you to submit AI generated work as part of a portfolio :(

Can you speak to anyone about this? Bring attention to it, suggest your artist friends!

One that's a fun sight to see as a newly enrolled art student :') (sarcasm, I'm pissed) Seriously, this school has a LARGE amount of artists and graphic designers, why not have some of them do an internship, temp job, or volunteer to make art for VCU????

Not a student anymore, but you guys should unironically “improve” these AI installations

this is literally just tacky and trashy behavior from them. can’t think of any other way to put it.

2 of my teachers have used AI or graphics for their class banners, and i thought that was bad, this is bonkers

Low key makes me think about taking a nap though. I think it’s the fog/mist in the background

I know!! It gets absolutely mogged by that painting too. Plus the quality of the print is absolutely horrible

It looks like deviantart furry art 😆

this is the way

You're kidding. No way.

Genuinely curious about this, do you have a source I can look into?

VCU has a long and rich history of employing great graphic designers, whether they were students or not. For years, we had one of the best graphic designers in the nation doing work for the athletic department. Seeing VCU pivot to AI for various things is deeply disappointing.

Artists could do it better

Even that would be better

Dat vcu collar tho

Real people can handle answering phone inquiries for businesses better than an AI automated voice messaging system too but this is the world we live in.

It's irritating. I made this in 20 minutes in Paint dot NET using preexisting, non-AI generated material. It's ugly as hell but better than the other one. https://preview.redd.it/23y7ronq38kf1.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=627e777b3cb6c605f82e9d6517fb1d84fb8ddb96

It’s not ugly! And it looks like him too c:

Thanks! And yeah, it does look like him because it is him, it's an official VCU graphic. They had no reason to use AI at all.

Yeah no I was just joking around cuz the other one doesn’t look like him at all

‘There was no stopping her:’ VCU student saves woman’s life at a local restaurant

i'm just gonna leave this one here

Wonder if they'll give full refunds for housing and meal plans in that case... Hahaha, I'm just kidding, of course they won't.

There was an email about it and the highest refund was 80%

And that’s just the *highest*. You can bet they’re go way lower than that if they can.

Pro-Palestine VCU students march through Richmond to protest war in Gaza

Paywalls are lame

The Chabad house in VCU had a schism over Palestine(its old leadership was a lot less explicitly zionist, but the new guy came in and it's gotten way more focus in the last year) and some of its members are going to protests like these, meanwhile the Chabad house itself is posting fucking photo ops with the homophobic antisemitic governor. I'm proud of the ones that stood up for what's right and didn't suck up to authority.

God it is really weird how little people understand about what’s going on. I don’t have an encyclopedic understanding or anything but I’m also not out here “educating” people about what protests are and aren’t valid. I support the Israeli and Palestinian people affected by this violence, and do not condone the actions of the Israeli government or Hamas, but the latter is a direct response to actions of the former. I’m not going to solve Israel-Palestine in Reddit comments and neither are any of you, so please stop attacking Jewish people who have the “gall” to speak their minds on the subject. Edit: changed “Iran-Palestine” to ‘Israel-Palestine’

Israel has acted badly in its conduct of the war in Gaza, but its pretty objectionable that this pro-Gaza protest happened on the anniversary of the Oct 7th attacks. Imagine if there’d been an anti-war rally against the Afghan war on Sept 11th, 2002. Including people openly supporting the Taliban/Al Quaida.

Protests in favor of Palestine on the anniversary of a terrorist attack? Guess optics aren’t a thing anymore

Lol, of all the hills to die on.........

The kids are fucking alright

The students should be more guided in their protests and aim their anger at the Israeli Likud govt and not Israel in general as the majority of Israelis don’t support what Netanyahu is doing and are protesting him and the Likud govt party who are failing the Israelis. Protest corrupt Netanyahu and his racist right wing politics who control the Israeli military. Student protesters need to wake up and realize who is causing the trouble in Israel- The Likud party and their corrupt leader and Hamas who stole the govt from the Palestinians not the moderate majority of the Israeli population who don’t condone what the Likud party is doing and making moderate Israel look bad fueling antisemitism with the way they are handling the war. The Israeli military takes their orders from Netanyahu and his war cabinet. The majority of the protesters at VCU sound like they aren’t educated in what they should be protesting- the brutality of the Likud party against the Palestinians who are not Hamas fighters and the corrupt prime minister who gives the military their orders. Things are always more complicated than protesting against Israel’s actions and being Pro Palestinian both of their governments are corrupt and are misguiding people’s actions on both sides.

as they should

Virtue signalers.

VCU needs one of those encampments with white people dressed as Palestinians

[Paywall Reader](https://paywallreader.com)

This school goes more left and left

Paywalls suck, but until someone figures out a way to pay professional journalists without them, we’re probably stuck with them.

Firstly, Imagine if the Afghan people or even Afghanistan had done 9/11 (my recollection is that is was funded by Saudi Arabia and I can't remember who did it but we, being the American people, definitely used it as an excuse for extensive islamaphobia). Secondly, holy shit the war on terror has been nothing but an excuse to bomb completely random brown people and to conduct mass surveillance in the name of patriotism. ETA: you can look at the attacks on October 7th as a prison break, if that helps (Palestine is colloquially referred to as the world's largest outdoor prison; Israel has quite a breadth of restrictions on what's allowed in and has a multi-tiered legal system with identification cards. It's literally an apartheid state built in the homes of those who've been pushed out).

It’s not objectionable. A year is a long time to relentlessly bomb and occupy territory.

The kids are hurting their own movement. Edit: they deleted my comment so I’ll put it here. They shouldn’t be staging protests on the day commemorating mass murder.

your comment is just blatantly false lmfao. the israelis are the ones actually carrying out the genocide. yeah, genocidal fuckheads like netanyahu and gallant are the ones ordering the genocide, but the israelis, who are required to serve in the army, are the ones doing it. this is like saying germany didn’t do the holocaust, only hitler and the ruling nazi party. if the israeli population didn’t support the genocide, there wouldn’t be settlers in the west bank literally [stopping aid trucks](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/05/26/west-bank-aid-trucks-gaza-settlers/) and [destroying the aid](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/illegal-israeli-settlers-block-aid-trucks-from-west-bank-to-besieged-gaza/3220387) set for gaza; israelis wouldn’t posting and bragging about things such as [blowing up the water reserve in rafah in celebration of shabbat](https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20240729-israel-blowing-up-of-drinking-water-reservoir-crime-against-humanity-rafah-municipality/amp/), actually [beheading babies](https://www.instagram.com/reel/C7Kwk2vyus9/?igsh=MXZ2M203anA3cHV1cQ==) and [children](https://youtu.be/UNdI_KMpCew), [looting homes](https://www.972mag.com/israeli-soldiers-looting-gaza/) and [wearing/playing with displaced and possibly murdered palestinian women’s lingerie](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israeli-soldiers-play-with-gaza-womens-underwear-online-posts-2024-03-28/); [39% of Israelis say Israel’s military response against Hamas in Gaza has been about right, while 34% say it has not gone far enough and 19% think it has gone too far](https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2024/05/30/israeli-views-of-the-israel-hamas-war/) also, stop trying to pit hamas and israel on similar levels of “badness.” israel is committing a genocide against a civilian population and now expanding it into other countries. hamas is not. full fucking stop.

bragging about not having virtue related to apartheid and genocide is a weird flex but ok go off with the self report I guess. I hope people take note and remember you for that.

You still haven't because that didnt happen

Jew here, don't speak for me I was at the protest against the genocide

Jewish kids are literally in the protest. You're distracting from actual antisemitism on campus, such as VCU's nazi problem and Christian zionists using them for an argument and leaving them to defend themselves from the backlash.

What a tone deaf comment holy shit

Yeah, there are still a few good eggs within Chabad, but a lot of the pro-Palestine Jewish people split off into one of a couple smaller student orgs with much lower budgets for stuff like mutual aid. Many members of pre-2022 Chabad felt alienated from all Jewish communities, especially LGBTQIA+ and BIPOC Jewish people as biases against them crystalized. The classic adage about Jewish people and opinions is "where you have two Jewish people, you have three opinions".

I’m for Palestinians to be treated as people but pretty hard to characterize the murder of 1000 people as a prison break.

Who caused the apartheid? The nationalist racist right wing politicians of Israel, not the moderate Israeli politicians that condone peace. Just like the moderate Palestinians getting hijacked by Hamas the moderate Israelis got hijacked by Likud. The blame should be placed on the extremists on both sides.

You're right, they should just shut up and let it happen. Silly me.

Do these racists even go to VCU? I mean VCU wouldn't let me Title IX a nazi who stabbed me on the basis of my ethnicity, but this is a public forum so it's easy to troll.

It's definitely a little oversimplified

Love the characterization of settler colonists benefitting from genocidal violence as "innocent Jews"

The IDF has literally done all of those things, including posing as aid workers, posting panty raids on tiktok, etc. Your claims that the whole population is responsible when they don't even have a mandatory conscription like the IDF has(which has basically zero punishment for avoiding btw) is utter pish. This didn't start October 7.

For one, Egypt doesn't like Hamas, which is entirely reasonable if lacking in understanding of how terrorism happens (Israel has all but ensured terrorism will continue in the region) Secondly, unless you can furnish a recent article about babies in their cribs and raping women, wasn't that found to be a hoax?

is being a Palestinian Jew with family living in Tel Aviv and voicing my opinion when someone speaks for me actually even remotely comparable to this?

I do! I think the key part of the definition is benefitting from the displacement of indigenous people. w We didn't just "move around"; we've done horrific things to the Native Americans and will probably continue to do so.

I don't know what you mean by door to door genocide; that was very much the wheelhouse of Zionist terrorists in building Israel though

Bro what is vcu on rn

Ngl it reads like a trump tweet https://preview.redd.it/ghguz0tz0z3f1.jpeg?width=942&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=51c6e121548f58c37d527bc4c1b4f88305529a93

Well, the City of Richmond Public Schools is currently having their graduations at the Siegel Center and due to the events over the past several years at RPS graduations, my guess is whoever is in charge of the alerts had several ready to go and then their cat walked across their keyboard and accidently sent one of the messages... ...seriously though, last week where VCU Health kept sending out the link for the conference call during the bomb threat and this week with the phantom civil unrest, they sure are dropping the ball lately...

When the job opening gets posted send it my way lol

I literally just came here to post about this. did vcu get hacked or wtf is going on with these texts

I assume there is a scroll down list of emergencies and civil unrest comes right after boil advisory.

I hope they’re not in trouble because the possibility of this happening more makes me feel optimistic in a whole new way

I was like whattt. I swear someone needs to get fired

Got a message from VCU Health that told me to disregard my previous message as well. https://preview.redd.it/6rsrj66xm34f1.jpeg?width=992&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f120691796a5dfaecc17cfd3a008d1815a2e4931

truly felt like a rollercoaster getting these lol

Those responsible have been sacked

😬 well, if they don't fix the water soon but, f government, am i r8 ?

That's some "There is no war in Ba Sing Se." type shit.

i graduated from mcv last year how do i disable the sms texts? lol

I was around Moore square for that graduation shooting. Def was chaos.

They're just practicing for whenever they incite it to make sure the system works

Welp, somebody's fired.

Someone's getting fired dawg

Someone is getting fired…probably someone underpaid

Crazy. What demographic could be causing so much unrest in Richmond?🤔

ITS THE DEEP STATE

Yeah I was at the Huguenot shooting, so I was legit worried for a second

Someone is most likely getting fired, especially with how they handled it by leaving the confusing text at the end

those responsible for the sacking have now been sacked

Text stop, Doc

no way it was that easy 😭😭 thank you i been just ignoring the texts

Ye no prob, also are you heading into residency or did you do a masters

At least the socy department knows what's up

This is not a violation of the rules of the subreddit emails that go out department wide are surely not private information. There would not be any expectation of privacy and they would be subject of a FOIA request anyways. Unless someone knows something I don't post is approved.

I’ve mer her before during open house and she was absolutely amazing, so seeing this email from her doesn’t surprise me in the slightest

the world studies and gender studies departments have also sent out similar emails and invited students to come decompress

I graduated with a bachelor’s in sociology a couple years ago and that department is full of great people and I thank many of them everyday for helping me become the person I am today. Glad someone is giving yall some comfort and stability you deserve. Solidarity with everyone on campus who participated, so many people are watching and are so proud of you.

There are good people at VCU. Rao is a joke (always has been) and the police response was 👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼, but let’s not conflate last nights events and Rao being Rao with the fact that the VCU community is (in large) solid.

Goated professor

As a former VCU Alumni with my B.S. in Sociology absolutely love this and how the department is supporting its students!

kinda disappointed i havent seen anything from the CRJS departments or the Wilder school. maybe they have and I haven’t seen it but idk :(

I agree! I've had so many professors and faculty reach out to my classes in solidarity, it's been really heartwarming actually.

VCU students succeed despite VCU, not because of it. The admins are pish, and the school seems to drive out any professor with a heart who doesn't phone it in, while letting the worst people thrive.

When I was in college 67-71, we protested the war. We were threatened with failing classes we didn't go to. I don't know of any professors that failed their students..

A single university employee at Virginia Commonwealth University made four false sex-assault allegations, is still employed at the university, and there is no indication in the news report that VCU has initiated any misconduct proceedings against them.

VCU pays so low that, if they fired the employee, they’d never find a replacement.

why do people think they can do this?!?!

Meanwhile VCU wouldn't fucking bounce people who were actually causing problems, such as the guy that was terrorizing the chabad house a while back, or my ex boyfriend who kept preying on freshmen, actively knowing that they were 17(speaking from experience as that 17 year old).

Cause they can.

Fr VCU doesn’t give a fuck. Last year there was a kid TERRORIZING women in GRC, stalking them, following them while calling their names, even following them into their dorm rooms without their consent. VCU’s only solution? Move him to Rhoads. Bc he certainly won’t pull the same shit there right? Well, as long as he’s still paying tuition🤷🏼‍♀️

All about the $$$$.

why are VCU students so pissy😭

It’s legitimately crazy how well documented these cases are and no action is taken.

High school seniors be like

Smart enough to have those grades but can't look up university average acceptance criteria within seconds on Google?

i feel like they're just trying to show off

I think part of the reason is high school counselors telling kids to be "realistic" and they shouldn't be disappointed if they get rejected for whatever reason. Leads to a lot of otherwise well qualified individuals thinking they're somehow below average lol

I feel like high school shit doesn’t matter since some of the smart people could end up being dumbasses

r/A2C_circlejerk

I know people that got in with a GPA of 2.8....like you’ll get in. The expectations aren’t really that high 😂

Lol I got in with a 2.7

Gonna start linking this in response to those threads lol

When I went back in the early 2000’s I think the only thing required was a pulse. Things sure have changed

So many kids in my grade were like this. Top ranked in the class and would say these things to me as if I wasn’t barely qualified.

This was pushed on us in high school tbh

They have to be. Otherwise they’d be posting “can I get into UVA?”

Our valedictorian from my HS cheated her way through and by the time she got into UCLA, she didn’t know shit

2.8 with what sat. I have a 1140 sat and 2.7 Gpa but I’ve done a internship and jobs and tutored kids for 2 different organizations and like 38 service hours. Other things as well. I also have a progressive increase in my gpa 2.4-2.5-3.1 that’s freshman to junior year. And then first quarter of senior year I finished with a 4.2 but sadly VCU can’t see that. But VCU is my top choice and I’m so fucking nervous.

Damn bro this gives me confidence better than CNU

YO SAME HERE xD

I got in with a 2.4 And a 930 SAT score.

Lol yeah, getting in is easy thankfully

Why is that such a common trend 💀

Alleged VCU frat hazing death I have seen quite a few posts online today about a VCU frat hazing a kid then him later dying of alcohol poisoning that night. I was wondering if anyone has heard about this? Edit: here is a Twitter link with more info https://twitter.com/gothgrlrights/status/1365815349317414915?s=21 Edit 2: VCU has made an official statement https://twitter.com/vcu/status/1366089628072239109?s=21 Edit 3: https://mobile.twitter.com/tylerjthrasher/status/1366060229037862915?s=21 seems a Channel 8 reporter has begun following the story Edit 4:I am for holding people accountable and hope that the people how are responsible for this are punished but please do not post and personal information In this thread. Doxing is extremely dangerous and risks people who aren’t involved getting hurt. Edit 5: https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-adams-family-with-postmortal-costs?utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=customer&utm_campaign=p_lico+share-sheet Here is a gofoundme that helps support the victims family.

I'm honestly really upset about this, as I'm sure the rest of the vcu community is. Nothing from VCU yet, or the local news. The frat has deleted their facebook, instagram, and twitter. We all want more information, but remember the school is probably notifying their next of kin right now so it may be a day or two before we get more comprehensive news. Edit: spelling

A frat killed a kid from hazing

The kid’s name was Adam Oakes, not Adam Oats

Wow. This is crazy to hear. I actually worked with the guy once, didn’t know him too well but was a good kid. The school needs to tighten up and actually take action on these frats. Sad to see him go.

Throw the book at all those fucking little shits.

Have there been any legal actions yet, or does anyone know what kind of actions could be taken against the boys involved?

There’s absolutely zero accountability for hazing in VCU Greek life. FSL knows this happens and turns a blind eye. Absolutely disgusting and tragic.

I went to VCU and was drugged at a Delta Chi party. Luckily I was with a friend who was sober enough to bring me home but I woke up with a black eye. Fuck Delta Chi

so much exposure and news needs to blow this story up so VCU won’t be able to run away from it or sweep it under the rug. this kid needs justice and i have a feeling they won’t want to deal with it properly if they aren’t forced to

https://twitter.com/tylerjthrasher/status/1366060229037862915?s=21 First local reporter I’ve seen pick up this story. u/nolifecat another update for you

Only thing I heard was a suspicious package at the Altria

Please tell me these frat boys are in jail

Not surprised to see Delta Chi. They were your stereotypical douchebag frat 10 years ago and I doubt much is different now.

I was shocked when I heard about this! Sad to hear too. I went through elementary, middle, and high school with him :(

Looks like VCU finally released a statement. https://www.wavy.com/news/virginia/richmond/vcu-fraternity-suspended-following-the-death-of-an-18-year-old-freshman/

damn. I graduated in 2016 but even back when I was a student Delta Chi had a really bad reputation for their behavior. I knew a few girls who went to their parties during freshman year and felt unsafe. Not really surprised this happened at one of their houses, but still sad all the same. 19 is so young. &#x200B; Delta Chi are big time trash.

NO FRATS ALLOWED

"This is a very complex situation and we will need time to investigate" Nothing will happen.

Care to share for the class more information on this?

Wholesome 100

Bruh, no joke, but you’re taking a frat at vcu so seriously you actually have hazing? Fucking go back to school at 26 like a real adult.

Wtf is that Twitter account? Fake troll account from someone in TX? What is their relationship to VCU, the situation, or the victim?

ive never been to vcu my sister goes seems fun

I didn’t even know. Rip

Ugh that breaks my heart. Fuck VCU!!!! 🤬

We also have to consider that the family may not want a lot of attention on this

The fact this hasn’t been released by local law enforcement or the university raises some eyebrows for sure. This would be picked up by the media in a heartbeat which could be why they are waiting until they know as much info as possible before sending out a press release.

That is not suspicious at all. This could be potential evidence if this whole thing is true for this alleged event. The data would not be gone anyway.

Ah, first time I’ve heard this happen at VCU, but unfortunately this is all too common. And it’s mainly *frats* in particular. Sororities have their own issues, but for the most part they’re alright. Frats on the other hand, seem to end up killing its members, date rape girls at every party, always get in the news for dumb shit, etc. I went to an SEC college during my first year, and I remember a kid dying during move-in week due to alcohol poisoning from hazing at a frat and it made national headlines. That shitty Greek culture needs to go, and needed to a long time ago.

He is my cousin.

Do you have more information?

I imagine the frat gets officially disbanded/suspended off of campus for a few years. But actual legal consequences? None except for maybe a few nights in a holding cell unless news blows up and makes VCU look bad.

If this is true, look at the Tim Piazza case at penn state, eerily similar circumstances

I am so surprised at the little accountability you guys are talking about. Southern schools and their Greek life.... wtf year is it?

The organizations are so quick to condemn individual members or even entire chapters, before accepting even an ounce of responsibility for allowing these behaviors/traditions to continue to grow.

unrelated, but true. i live in grc and the roads were blocked off by cop cars

there’s so much to get them in for. throwing a party in a pandemic, giving alcohol to minors, hazing, murder. the list goes on

I’m all for holding people accountable but I’d prefer if we don’t start doxing people

Check the edit

Easy there, Witcher

Would also love to know this.

Clearly he didn’t get raptured this week so he flunked the test.

Guy on the right pretending to consider it

Mormons? They are getting more common around W&M campus.

I saw this today and wanted to be like “it’s a trick question. Heaven doesn’t exist” but I was running late. I cannot stand the religious proselytizing all over campus. Takes everything in me to be polite and ignore these people everyday. No one is getting converted in this manner.

Wondering if the "test" is if you walk away before punching?

He got jumped one year LOL

he has been there all the time for the whole time ive gone here

I was wondering where he was. Haven’t seen him since last year

All you have to do is believe in Christ, right? Then you can wipe your hands clean. Doesn’t matter what we do in this dirty rest stop we call earth.

The Division of Student Affairs just sent a vague email about protecting first amendment rights. I have strong feelings about this in that if your org isn’t connected to the university, then it has no business soliciting there especially in hostile and divisive ways. More than once, the older white man who is part of this church org has gotten in my face claiming he knows me and my values. I’ve fought hard not to mirror his hostility but I can only take so much. If you are also being harassed by these fundies, please let the Division of Student Affairs know. The more of us who speak up, the more I hope they get banned. At least the Jehovah’s witnesses are kind/let you come to them!

Why is it always right there too 🙄

That mf got that Arab dude questioning his life. All jokes aside this preacher is really dedicatedly out of all colleges he goes to vcu and talks the whole day

![gif](giphy|tyttpHckIUDJQ7TeVHi|downsized) Free test you said?

The level of hatred y'all have for religion is honestly super weird

No strings attached, I can just know on the spot?

what happens if you say yes does he pop u right there lmao

will he give me 40 thousand dollars to be christian

Is your hand bigger than your face?

The Guy on the right isn't

That totally makes the pic! Lol.

we have a ton here too

We also have a very persistent Hare Krishna at VCU. He even showed up at Iron Blossom.

I don't think mormons believe in traditional heaven

I like your attitude. It makes me think I might suggest to this guy that he take his act to Liberty U and ask the good folks there. What with them being Christian Warriors, and Jer' Jr playing the cuck role, I'm certain they're still all saved?!

I made out with him (im a femboy)

Yes, but what you do on Earth still matters. That's why Christ ended the parable of the Good Samaritan with "go and do likewise."

No evidence for Christ, lots of evidence that we have a temporary, precious life here on earth and should therefore take greatest care with our home

The guy didn't mention which one, so...

The femboy part is very important lmao😌

So my sins can't be forgiven?

Exactly why I converted to Islam ❤️

Yes it's just not called Heaven in the mormon religion. You have the celestial kingdom instead. There are technically 3 levels, but the celestial kingdom is the "top tier" most Heaven-like.

Oh no booboo, no evidence for your stuff either :(

Enjoy your fedora big dawg, the heathens are a plenty

Visas revoked for three at VCU, nine at Virginia Tech, 10 at GMU

Good time to remind everyone that Michael Rao thinks it is possible to follow state and federal law and be a welcoming place for everyone at VCU. International students at VCU should check their status daily and not walk alone or ever give out your name to strangers. Be safe everyone

**"Two international VCU students and one recent graduate have received visa terminations," VCU spokesman Michael Porter said in a statement. "Privacy laws prevent us from sharing additional details."**

Cant read paywall unfortunately

Rao being an asshole as per usual. Only question was how long until he caved in to this BS.

Like politicians, university leaders only job is to keep money rolling in. Education, study, and research trail far behind.

This website is why local news is dying and deserves it

I don’t know the fulls details of each case, so i won’t defend their visas being revoked. However, people do need to realize that being granted a visa is not a right, it’s a privilege. It’s like inviting someone into your house - and if you say a bunch of mean shit about their house and don’t respect it, don’t be mad when you get kicked out. Again, I don’t know if these particular students deserved it or not, but if you are disrespecting the country that generously granted you the privilege to live and study there, it shouldn’t be shocking when you get your visa revoked.

Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.

Bye bye Gaza cucks

fyi for affected folks beyond "see our mental health counselors" , probably most available in this order --- \- Richmond Legal Aid -- [https://www.justice4all.org/](https://www.justice4all.org/) \- VA ACLU -- [https://www.acluva.org/en/get-help](https://www.acluva.org/en/get-help) \- Palestine Legal -- [https://palestinelegal.org/](https://palestinelegal.org/)

Opening the door for further attacks and speed running international brain drain from his institution. Why would any student looking at places to study abroad look at the US in this climate? And why does he think capitulating means they will stop attacking? MAGA has an ideological disdain for education. At least fight for your institution and call their bluff.

We don't even know who these students are or why their visas were revoked

The students that had their visa revoked had violated rules against antisemitism.I’ve seen the chaos and intimidation at Monroe Park.

Bye bye, smart people wanting to come to the US and more importantly, bye bye freedom of speech.

I'm so excited to see the pro ethnic cleansing side represented. Good job.

It’s mind blowing to me that people think VCU has an option.

It's a bot in all likleyhood. Generic ass username.

And I’ve seen pro Palestine events in Monroe Park that included students with Yamakas on so I don’t think there was any so called intimidation going on bud

Oh, now I see. They criticized Israel’s murdering of thousands of middle eastern children. Anti-semitism!

A bot doesn’t answer specifics.

This person is mentally unwell. They have referred to civilians in Gaza as “rat terrorists” in their comment history and it appears they’ve maybe even crudely attempted to delete stuff over time (?). I’d just steer clear.

What I ABSOLUTELY LOVE is American Christians calling for the death of CHRISTIAN (and Muslim and other) children. But I guess since those Christians are brown, they are allowed to die.

Good grief. Some people, man.

Oh I didn’t know that’s how you spell it thank you I just wrote it out phonetically lol

Here we go again

I’m a staff member in Inclusive Excellence. Our small team is pretty devastated, but not surprised. Hoping I have a job somewhere else in the university… Edit: A good update. I have found HR to be helpful exploring fair options for me. Colleagues have been very kind and supportive and are a main reason I have stayed at VCU as long as I have. ❤️‍🔥Thanks everyone for your kindness in the comments too!

dumbest bootlicking shit ever

knew this is what was going to happen. understand why vcu is bending over. still not going to continue my education here. another university can have my grad school money

I was so disappointed to get this today. Not surprised, but it still burns.

Assholes. They link an FAQ with a DEI tipline in the email, looks like malicious compliance time.

Please don’t bash- I am trying to get a better understanding and learn. What exactly does the Division of inclusive excellence do? Again I am trying to educate myself and not shade anyone. I am older alumnus and have been very supportive of VCU.

How is it the law? Isn't it just executive orders??

How is inclusion discrimination? I hate this timeline.

“Let’s fight discrimination!” “No not like that!”

honestly not surprised by this at all, especially considering the BOV's absolute chaos of not implementing the racial literacy requirement last year 😐

It’s not the point what these offices do. The point is that this Administration is pulling MILLIONS FROM RESEARCH and important student funding from major humanitarian contributors at universities across the country. Forcing ancient American Universities to do Trump’s bidding. There’s nothing legitimate about this. Medical, environmental, scientific and cultural institutions are being thrown under Trump’s bus and no this is not legal. It’s an absolute abuse of power with an Administrative Order. My State University has fallen victim to Trumps abuse as well.

I’ve always said replace “Race” with “Social Economic” factors and you’ll get the similar result. We should strive to give all marginalized people an opportunity to get a higher education.

cowards. liars. fools. stand up to the fascist and immoral federal orders. if they told you to jump off a cliff, would you do it?

Damn looks like DIE is gonna die.

So disappointed

Can someone explain please

Can someone explain what this means

Turns out Boomers and Gen X are really good at bending over for dictators. Glad I went to VCU during the Obama years, cuz this ain’t it.

Well, this may have made our decision smh

The school takes federal funding as well as state which Youngkin is trump’s pal. If they refuse VCU would pay dearly.

Love seeing all the brainless people here 😭. Absolutely worth being notified of lucifers minions pages.

Y'all were delusuional to think anything but money talks. Ofc they aren't going to jeopardize their funding over dei.

Just open a division of Excellence Thru Togetherness and keep going.

This is the next step in the fight against affirmative action after the 2010s court case rulings. What they want is to make the argument that by focusing on the betterment of minorities who have history been persecuted and dismissed in terms of equal opportunities, that these institutions are discrimination against those that have NOT historically been persecuted and have always been the first ones to receive opportunities. Long story short, by improving minority lives, you're excluding and persecuting the majority 😂 that's the argument they want to make. That's what Make America Great Again Means to them. A return to majority dominance

Slow clap. Come on Richmond— what are we made of?

final semester, one more 3 week summer class, diploma in august, and i’m never stepping foot here again

VA Tech has the same thing coming up the 1st week of April. It's sickening. Edited for clarity

I hope there are campus protests

Extortion, another illegal action by the MAGA cartel along with kidnapping, human trafficking, market manipulation and insider trading, ignoring legal directives and threatening judges, the list goes on and on.

Tbf, a job in the department of "Inclusive excellence" sounds mostly useless

I love how following federal law and making everyone feel welcome is just not referring to queer people. fuck rao, fuck fotis. may they watch their loved ones suffer

Well, time to cross this school off my list of where to potentially earn my doctorate.

So in short, they still intend to discriminate but will hide it better.

DEI officers make more than professors. Glad to see this nonsense go. Get rid of them

Real honest question for everyone, what's wrong with doing away with DEI? By that I mean, shouldn't everything be based off of the best person for the job, the most qualified and not necessarily the color of a person's skin? Wasn't it MLK that said based a person by their character and not the color of their skin? It seems to me that DEI takes away from that notion. There will always be people that are racist, that will never change, racism happens on both sides and always will if we're being honest. But I will say, telling me I have to believe a man is a woman and vice versa isn't reality. No man should be allowed in a woman's locker room just because he says he identifies as a woman.

What is diversity inclusive excellence? Is that we’re no matter how terrible a persons grades are or how much they skip school as long as they are a certain color they can be enrolled?

Tricky tricky tricky if you get rid of state govt. And cant sue federal you canylt change anything. Good. For us we are so blessed to live in. Gilead. Lol

Good! Hire people on merit, not based on looks!!!!

I don’t know if it would have changed anything, but the dei industry as a whole doesn’t do a very good job of explaining what it is they do on a day to day basis. “Inclusive excellence” the name alone makes it feel sort of gimmicky. Some sort of office like this was needed at UVA in the 50’s. Is it needed at VCU in 2025?

Stop supporting this school. Stop attending, drop out of your classes, and don’t look back. Do you think it stops here?

My first thought was, "What happens to the people in the Division of Inclusive Excellence?" Do you know if there are plans to transition people (you and all the others) elsewhere along with the programs? I really hope so!

I’m so sorry! Did you get a heads up before the email was sent?

Love the kindness from everyone!!! I’m an alum as well as a staff member and the well wishes make my heart happy. ❤️‍🔥

Sorry to hear that, I’m hoping VCU has an option for you to easily apply or transition to other jobs within the university.

I'm really sorry you're going through this and I hope you and your team are able to get new placements. And I'm sorry you didn't get much forewarning (aside from the writing on the wall).

Good luck, I REALLY hope there is another position. 🤞

Im interested in knowing the outcome for you. Do you get another job or are you just let go?

I’m so sorry for the uncertainty you’re going through!

Can someone(preferably another woman) please go with me to the hospital? I was SA'd and could use some help I have no friends or family here, literally no one. Is anyone available to go with me to St. Mary's tomorrow morning? I was unable to go today by myself because of awful anxiety Update: I found someone to go with me, thank you all for your kindness

yo dm me, i am free tmrw morning + i have a car

Here is a link that has resources: https://police.vcu.edu/sexual_violence/victim_witness_program.html I’m so sorry💔

I’m an RN at VCU and am off tomorrow. I can drive you to St. Mary’s or VCU Health.

Oh love I’m so sorry 🫂 check out safe harbor: https://safeharborshelter.com. They offer hospital accompaniment services - they might be able to help.

As the dad of a vcu freshman woman, it sickens me to read this and proud of all of you for stepping up for this young woman. I’m so sorry this has happened to you, OP.

Not a student, but a VCU student's mom. I'm so sorry. If your ride falls through DM me and I'll take you.

I went to saint marys one time for a rape kit & they sent me to another hospital. It's been 6 years but I'd call first just so you're not being tossed around during an already traumatizing experience. They will also be able to connect you with a victim advocate and therapist. Sending you all of the love 💗

I sent a dm

Send me a message if no one else comments, I won’t be available until later afternoon though

The hospital will also provide an advocate for you if you end up not finding anyone to go with.

So glad you found someone to go with you. Please reach out anytime if you need support or a friend. I am sorry you have to go through this alone.

Mom of a VCU student here. I’m so sorry you’re going through this. Please DM me anytime if you need anything now or going forward. Sending love to you ❤️

Let us know if you got the help u needed.

Call the cops & ask for a female officer. They’ll do it

As a male redditor this thread brought me hope for humanity, lot of beautiful souls in here 🙌🏼

Hi! A mom here that lives down the street from vcu. I’m glad you found someone to take you to the hospital. If you need anything else or just mom ears close by to talk with let me know. I am so sorry this has happened to you.

Mom of VCU student. I am so sorry that you are going through this and so proud of you for reaching out. I can take you and help in any way.❤️

im so sorry :(

Did you get someone to go with you?

Glad you found someone. I wish you the best and I hope it gets better

Sending love to you. If you could use help with groceries or a homemade meal during this time, I’m happy to help any way I can. -a female who has been through similar and know we need to support each other ❤️‍🩹

Sweet child, I wish I had seen your post when you needed a friend. Stay strong.

I just saw your post . I’m glad someone will go with you. Reach out again if you need more help honey❤️

I’m terribly sorry for what you’re going through. I’m relieved you found a ride. I just wanted to wish you the best on your healing journey. A piece of what helped me was a SA survivors group. Maybe when you’re ready that will help you too 🩷

Dm me if you need ANYTHING.

If there is absolutely anything you need in the coming days, you’re absolutely welcome to reach out to me. Local female who has been in your shoes. I’m more than willing to provide support if you need it.

I’m queer but I’d be happy to help you

I am so sorry, OP 😔

I’m a VCU mom and reading this post and all the loving supportive comments has me in tears. I’m so sorry you are going through this sweetie, I’m just glad you found someone to go with you. If you ever need anything else or just a listening ear dm me and we can talk. Sending love prayers and lots of hugs your way.

I was going to volunteer but glad you found someone. I’m really sorry you’re going through this.

Call the YWCA of Richmond. They specialize with helping survivors of SA and DV. They can connect you with an advocate who can help you through the process even after the exam. You can call their 24/7 hotline (804) 612 - 6126 — even if it’s just to talk. That’s what they are there for. And you may also be eligible to stay in their shelter if you feel unsafe where you are. I work for a YWCA in another location. I’m so sorry, you do not deserve any of this and nothing you did made this happen to you. This was an evil choice, made by an evil person. I won’t tell you this won’t be hard, but I promise you that there are kind and good people out there dedicating their lives to helping survivors like you get through this ♥️

I'm available too if you haven’t already found someone. I'm so sorry!

Sending love your way.

I hope you feeling better.Just know, everything was going to be okay RAINN.

If you still haven't found someone dm me!

You’re so brave for asking for help! It makes me happy to see that you got the help you needed and people stepping up for it. I’m so sorry this happened to you. ❤️

Yes, thank you all

Please remember to be safe at night, even if you don’t think you do (possible close encounter) I was walking back from studying, on Grace St, a few mins after 1am (ik, ik) when I encountered a couple of guys hanging out outside. I didn’t think much of it, but when I crossed the street to the N side of Grace, they followed and approached me, and I heard one of them say “let’s hit this n****”. I was able to slink into insomnia cookies since I was literally right there, ordered 2 cookies, during which the guys seemingly lost interest in me and went on their way. I have been at VCU for 4 years now and haven’t really ever questioned my safety until now… especially since I am a 5’11” guy who is decently in shape. But please remember to be hypervigilant at night, especially if you are a member of a vulnerable population, but also if you aren’t and don’t think anything can happen to you! When I got back to my car, I drove around to see if they were around anywhere so I could potentially get a picture to report them, but I couldn’t find them. Not sure if I should report them at this point as I don’t have much of a description other than “2 guys who were black and looked like they were in their 20’s” At the time, there was no one immediately outside near me, but there were a decent amount of people walking outside after I had gotten my cookies.

My suggestion if you ever feel an inclination to report something like this, follow it. Don’t think about getting a picture, that’s your brain talking. Brains do better at justifying than keeping us safe. Thanks for posting anyway. I’m sure you aren’t the only one who’s experienced this lately and had similar reactions. It’ll probably only be getting worse for a while :( A similar unnerving situation happened to me in a parking deck at night. I called campus police bc I didn’t want it to happen to some other student who might’ve came in after me. I felt lucky to be handicapped for once in my life cause my car was parked right there lol

Any way you could ask the cookie place if they had cameras pointing that direction? If not, contact police and try to get traffic cams or any other cams in the area?

You should report just so maybe they can be on the look out.

Situational awareness is so so important no matter when or where. Glad you’re safe and I’m so sorry you experienced that ❤️

Thanks for the warning. I spend a lot of time at the figure drawing building which is on Grace St and sometimes walk back late at night. I had a similar thing happen a few nights back at around 8:30 on Grace St in front of West Grace North. Group of guys with the same discription you gave yelled at me and I swear one of them called me a dyke. There was a ton of people around so I wasn’t scared something bad would happen to me so I ignored it

Glad nothing bad happened to you. For what it's worth, there are too many cameras all over both campuses to have to be concerned with taking pictures yourself. Chances are, if you report an encounter and call VCU PD, someone there is going to find a few images of the people you describe.

Possible close encounter

Dang that sucks but let me guess ,you’re probably one of those vcu kids who believes in “fck 12/fck the police” ….until you need them😅

Definitely file a police report, it helps them decide where to have police presence.

Even if you don't think you do what?

Ain’t no one say that to you I was outside smoking inna dark on the porch no one said that to you

“But even if you aren’t” smacks of white-cis-male privilege — as does being scared of two Black guys in the dark. Seems like OP is a teensy tiny bit racist and got scared of the dark and the people with skin darker than his own. Welcome to Richmond and what is mostly still a free country Black people can be outside after dark and talk to each other about any manner of things. Richmond is a diverse city full of all sorts of wonderful people as is the VCU campus, if you can’t take it go move somewhere else.

Sorry to hear that. Always seem to be VCU alerts from that block in particular.

I believe that the police force has room for improvement but have never said such things.

you're a cornball. "inna dark"

OP said he didn’t think much of it until he heard “let’s hit this n****” so it seems like they weren’t just two guys in the dark. They could’ve been talking to each other about something else who knows but it’s not a bad idea to be vigilant hearing that alone at night. From personal experience I’ve been verbally accosted on Grace St multiple times in my year at VCU and everytime it was a group of young black men. Personal anecdote is not reliable however so If you want demographic data the “Crime in Virginia 2023” report published by the department of state police is readily available online. https://rga.lis.virginia.gov/Published/2024/RD437/PDF Richmond is certainly a diverse city yes with lots of amazing people, there are also racists of course and criminals same as any other city. Don’t pretend however that safety at night is race blind because that’s ignorant of readily available information.

If two guys approached me, looked at me and said "let's hit this guy" to each other, followed me across the street, then reversed course after I went into an establishment, I would be scared, regardless of what they look like. I do happen to be a white cis male, and I am privileged to be a member of demographic that is not a target of sexual violence or hate crimes. This may have led to my complacency with walking alone late at night, though it is mostly that given my height and build, I did not perceive myself as being an easy target. The only reason I even bothered to mention their race at all is to describe the individuals I encountered. I don’t know why you are accusing me of being racist as I do not harbor negative feelings for any individuals on the basis of things they have no control over.

You’re embarrassing

What is verbally accosted lol, like you were walking down the street and someone said something to you? Yeah, most of the people who say stuff to you, in a majority-black city, will be black? It was pretty unnecessary to add that part to your comment but even more unnecessary to add VA crime statistics and act like it’s justifiable to be more afraid of black people than white people at night like wtfff. did COVID hitting when you were still a kid make you ignorant? I graduated in ‘23 but i remember the white ppl on campus being less ignorant than this

“If two guys approached me, looked at me and said "let's hit this guy" to each other, followed me across the street, then reversed course after I went into an establishment, I would be scared, regardless of what they look like.” So now your story is changing? Now they approached you instead of followed you… and they said let’s hit this guy… and you somehow knew they were talking about you because they approached you instead of followed you. Puh-lease. They reversed course after you went into a business? Like they stopped and didn’t follow you in or they stopped and met some people that were coming out or they just decided to go somewhere else? And they were completely gone when you left? Look… if they really wanted to “hit” you, they’d have waited around for you to come outside. “I do happen to be a white cis male, and I am privileged to be a member of demographic that is not a target of sexual violence or hate crimes.” For all the downvotes my original comment got, it looks like I called it… you’re a cis-white male which in this particular instance also means you’re more likely to be racially biased, especially at night and when you already perceive danger. Then given that these two people were minorities and POC you immediately assumed they were talking about you or targeting you. “This may have led to my complacency with walking alone late at night, though it is mostly that given my height and build, I did not perceive myself as being an easy target.” A target?! You were the victim of what… your own racial biases?! Target seems to indicate that something happened. Nothing happened aside from you accusing two people who were doing nothing of plotting something against you. “The only reason I even bothered to mention their race at all is to describe the individuals I encountered.” 💁‍♀️ what a helpful description… two black males in their 20s. — no clothing or body description or anything. So in point of fact the only thing that seemed to jump out to you about these guys was their race. “I don’t know why you are accusing me of being racist as I do not harbor negative feelings for any individuals on the basis of things they have no control over.” It’s pretty obvious why I accused you of being racist… you assumed the intention of two guys who you overheard make a comment that may or may not have been about you or directed to you and essentially told the world “watch out for two black guys at night, they may be committing crimes” it’s pretty basic Chad/Karen behavior. Here’s two black guys on the street existing at 1 am, they’re probably up to no good. I resisted replying to u/EvilChewbacca’s comments, but I’ll go ahead and reply to those now too: OP said he didn’t think much of it until he heard “let’s hit this n****” so it seems like they weren’t just two guys in the dark. They could’ve been talking to each other about something else who knows but it’s not a bad idea to be vigilant hearing that alone at night. Well it seems OP has now changed his story from being followed, which is creepy, to being approached. So maybe it was actually neither. Maybe he just saw these guys on the sidewalk, heard a comment - whether it was let’s hit this guy or what who knows. I’m not disagreeing it’s good to be vigilant. You absolutely should be. But airing your biases on the internet is wild! Like “hey I saw two black guys and got scared even as a cis-white male, so watch out everyone.” From personal experience I’ve been verbally accosted on Grace St multiple times in my year at VCU and everytime it was a group of young black men. That definitely sucks! I’ve been called slurs too (responding to what you said when someone asked you what accosted meant) but unless someone is getting super aggressive and looks like they’re going to assault me I don’t take it personally and keep it moving. Best to not engage. Personal anecdote is not reliable however so If you want demographic data the “Crime in Virginia 2023” report published by the department of state police is readily available online. https://rga.lis.virginia.gov/Published/2024/RD437/PDF OK… so you’re going to rely on data from systemically racist systems? If that’s the case intraracial crime is far more prevalent than interracial crime. So, there’s that too… Richmond is certainly a diverse city yes with lots of amazing people, there are also racists of course and criminals same as any other city. Don’t pretend however that safety at night is race blind because that’s ignorant of readily available information. WTF racist? Like “I’m not a racist but…I’ll cite arguably racist data and pretend like I’m not a racist and I’ll instead hint at saying be wary of POC at night” which you a Italy doubled down on later… Additionally Richmond is not a majority-black city making up about 28% of the population though it is a larger portion compared to the national average. Where the heck did you pull that number from? Census data indicates Richmond is 41% Black and 41.7% white. I also never said the city was majority Black I just indicated that the country is mostly free, though that’s probably less accurate than more accurate. But 28%…? To address the last bit, the harsh truth is that yes it’s justifiable to be more afraid of black people at night than white people. This doesn’t apply to all black people nor should you let it affect how you treat other people but the vast majority of criminals in Richmond are black. If you are to be murdered, robbed, car stolen or assaulted at night the offender will most likely be black. It’s a terrible problem within the community and there are numerous causes for the racial disparity but it’s a fact nonetheless. Until people can recognize these issues without being called racist they will never be fixed only perpetuating the racial divide in our country. OK MAGA… listen… you’re all over the place there you’re trying to say there is systemic inequities and systemic problems but also trying to say that Black people and POC are still the cause of the problem.

Verbally accosted as in called a derogatory slur “f*ggot” or other hurl of insults directed towards me. It’s not exceedingly common but it’s happened multiple times and was worth mentioning. Additionally Richmond is not a majority-black city making up about 28% of the population though it is a larger portion compared to the national average. To address the last bit, the harsh truth is that yes it’s justifiable to be more afraid of black people at night than white people. This doesn’t apply to all black people nor should you let it affect how you treat other people but the vast majority of criminals in Richmond are black. If you are to be murdered, robbed, car stolen or assaulted at night the offender will most likely be black. It’s a terrible problem within the community and there are numerous causes for the racial disparity but it’s a fact nonetheless. Until people can recognize these issues without being called racist they will never be fixed only perpetuating the racial divide in our country. Also, linking the 2023 statistics was 100% necessary to back up my claim.

I used this source for Richmond population data, it encompasses the entire Richmond Metropolitan Statistical Area of which 28% are black. https://datausa.io/profile/geo/richmond-va-31000US40060 You are correct that using the more specific Richmond data roughly 41% is black and 41% white. https://datausa.io/profile/geo/richmond-va/ I overlooked that the first source was for the MSA. Regardless, this is rather irrelevant as I used state wide crime data. You accuse this data of being useless as it’s from a systemically racist institution. I can guarantee that even if the rate of false convictions / arrests was at its all time peak there would not be significant statistical change in crime rates by race, that’s how wide the difference is. Additionally the report differentiates convictions and arrests meaning the cases used were rendered guilty verdicts in a fair court of law. The crime rates by race data in the report is consistent nationwide and has been for years on end. Even if there are flaws in the criminal justice system those are not primarily responsible for what the statistics say. Also, I am not saying that “black people are the problem” simply that they commit vastly more crimes at a higher rate across every age / sex demographic. The causes behind that are numerous including: Poor access to safe low income housing, culture, community location, holdovers of America’s systemically racist past, illegal firearm access, drug use etc. I am not MAGA lol and far from it. As I stated, until people can acknowledge the factual reality of Americas crime demographics honestly it will never change. And as you mentioned, intraracial crime is exceedingly more common than interracial. The majority of Americas gun violence (excluding suicide) comes from black teens shooting each other, it is black communities being the most impacted by the crime epidemic. The view that acknowledging controversial problems like this is racist negatively impacts the minority populations themselves.

as long as ur recognize that almost all mass shootings are caused by white ppl and ur more afraid of them at certain times cool, but if ur only more afraid of black ppl at night u need to check ur prejudice asap

White people perpetuate ~55% of mass shootings, a far cry from “almost all.” Black people are responsible for ~21.3% of mass shootings (Not including gang violence). In all the race of mass shooters mostly lines up with US population demographic data https://rockinst.org/gun-violence/mass-shooting-factsheet/ The countries high profile, highest casualty mass shootings however are typically white though. If I’m afraid of a shooting at university I would fear a white shooter. Conversely if I’m afraid of being shot walking home from class I’d be more afraid of a black shooter. It’s terrible but yes there are unique problems endemic to different races and unfortunately like you mentioned, situational times to be more afraid of one than another.

I was accepted!! Vcu nursing school

Congrats! That’s awesome! 🤩

Congrats! That's a tough program to get into. Our daughter is a spring 2024 grad. I know how stressful that application process is!

Congratulations !!!

Congratulations!!

Welcome to VCU!

Congrats!!! Hope to see you around the hospital!

Congrats !!

Thank you!!

Congratulations to her & Thank you!

Thank you! I already took all my anatomy classes

I finished a good amount of my prerequisites before applying that’s all

You take Anatomy while a pre nursing major and it's considered as part of your transcript when you apply to become an actual nursing major, usually the 2nd semester of sophomore year. A&P is a pre-reqs for the official nursing programs. As the name implies, PRE-requisites must be completed before starting the program.

Student arrested at VCU gathering to mark the anniversary of Gaza encampment

“As they’re [those assembled] leaving the lawn, one of the students held up a sign,” Hadaad said. “I think the sign said something along the lines of, ‘Are you gonna tear gas us again?’ And he held up the sign. Next thing you know, a police officer grabs him by the arm with no warning and says, ‘You can’t have that sign,’ and arrests him.” Makes me sick.

"Turned violent" You mean after the students were tear gassed?

This is what fascism looks like. Walls of police grabbing & arresting a peaceful protestor literally just for holding up a sign they don't like. Also, Free Palestine 🇵🇸 Opposing genocide is the duty of every decent person.

Here's an article that isn't behind a paywall: [Man arrested at pro-Palestinian gathering at VCU on anniversary of protest turned violent | WRIC ABC 8News](https://www.wric.com/news/local-news/richmond/vcu-anniversary-pro-palestinian-protest-turned-violent/)

Archived article so it can be read https://archive.is/2MKrS

Isn't there a designated place on campus for protests? Did the arrested student(s) simply refuse to relocate to designated spot?

Rules do not apply to the pro-Palestinian crowd.

We’re arresting people that support terrorists? ermagherd October 7, reap the whirlwind

Yeah, so much for free speech. When I was in college I participated in peaceful protest Of the Vietnam war. None of our signs were confiscated, nobody was arrested.

Exactly, after police violently attacked protesters

The charges were dropped. Edit: I misread the article-- current charges have not been dropped.

Viva Israel!

Pro hamas progenocide rally. There fixed the title for you.

It wasn’t even technically a protest. When the administration complained that the event is “unauthorized”, SJP immediately declared the end of the official event as of that time. So, it was just a bunch of students deciding to chill on the lawn on their own. They paid for this school so they should have the right to sit on the lawn that they paid. Have no mistake that the student who got arrested very much for the content of his speech not for the fact that he spoke at the wrong place. The catholic priests and every other organizations including pro lifers are allowed to hold up their signs wherever they want, but it’s only any signs supporting Palestine are immediately strike down. This is called attack against free speech, this is what fascism looks like.

Yeah, I'm pretty sure the spot is near the VCU sign, but they wouldn't leave even after asked 3 times. I don't get why they needed that spot specifically or why it was such a big deal moving to where they were told they were supposed to be to begin with.

This time? Not that I know of, this scenario just seems like a poor arrest but this is also the first I’m hearing of it. The one that happened last year? Pretty much. Last year, they started setting up tents and stating they were gonna stay there all night, that, by definition, is an encampment. VCU policy CLEARLY states that unless you have a permit, encampments are not permitted. The protest was peaceful when it first started, in fact, I participated, up until they pulled out tents. I left because, unlike those people, I actually read VCU’s policies when applying and before I accepted the offer and knew what they were doing wasn’t allowed. They were told to leave because it was un permitted and a lot of them refused. The police showed up, because that’s literally their job, to make sure un permitted protestors dispersed. And I saw the videos, videos that were proudly posted by the protestors. That shit was NOT peaceful once they were told to leave by PD. I mean they were literally throwing water bottles at the cops. When asked about it, most of them either denied that it happened, despite video evidence, or said it was self defense, which isn’t a valid claim. I won’t argue that VCU isn’t shit and that maybe VCU and the cops went about it poorly. But you don’t fight with the cops on site, you wanna fight the cops? Do it in court. Can’t afford a lawyer? Well if you were arrested, you get one for free. I’m sure there are also plenty of “only pay if you win” lawyers if you wanna sue that badly.

Yeah, US soil

Protests at VCU now have to be approved in advance

nor to israel or the united states, apparently

Can you not hold two thoughts at once? One can speak up for the disregarded people of Palestine without supporting any actions by Hamas. You must understand that.

Want to see the video of a mob of Jewish men in Brooklyn chasing and assaulting a woman?

From yesterday, or his arrest last year? Charges wouldn’t be dropped the same night of an arrest.

Your comment seems to be oversimplifying some stuff. Just because SJP declared the end of the OFFICIAL event, doesn’t really mean shit. I mean the way you worded it, is literally the main problem we’re having with the current administration. It’s misinformation, whether intentional or not. Yes, SJP “ended” the event, but that doesn’t mean the protest stopped, it just means the organizer is pulling out. Were they still holding up their signs? Was the reason they were still there for a cause? This example may not be perfect, but it’s the best I can think of at this time. When we left the United Kingdom, did their government cease to exist? Did their duties change? No, they continued to exist. Or maybe this example is better. I did not make my work schedule, my boss did. Now she’s there when I arrive, but she left before I was scheduled to leave. Well I wouldn’t be there if she didn’t put me on the schedule, but that doesn’t mean my shift is over just because hers was. When SJP disbanded the event, that didn’t automatically turn the protestors into people that just wanted to chill on the lawn. They were still protesting, they were just doing it without the affiliation of an organizer. What VCU did, it was terrible, and I sympathize with those people that got injured. BUT you can NOT play the victim in that scenario. You even admit that they were told the event was unauthorized, the SECOND they were told that, they should have put the signs away and went about their day. They could have came back at a later date with a permit, it’s not like it’s hard to get one. Like I said earlier, you wanna fight the cops? You wanna fight VCU? Do it in court, if you choose to fight the cops in the street, YOU ARE GOING TO LOSE.

i was there after the tents were set up. it WAS the police who started the violence. students only threw water bottles at the cops AFTER being teargassed and attacked by police (who showed up to a peaceful protest in full riot gear and with rifles), and organizers were actively telling people to stop throwing bottles.

Literally took the words out of my head

No you can't. Hamas gazans and more broadly palezti Ian's participated in attempted genocide on 10/7 and started a war. People get killed in war. Palestinians started the war. And Israelis fight within the laws governing war while the Palestinians and their progenocide supporters hold rallies on us college campuses.

There is too much evidence to not extend professional courtesy on this. Oct 7 = whirlwind that comes

Didn't happen. Rallies probably or other religion of peace terrorists.

This seems academic. Because you know I’ll say “want to seem terrorists violate women on Oct 7”

Thanks, I misread.

I saw something different, i saw a video from someone standing, I think it was, outside the library doors. I don’t have the video because I didn’t bother to save it but the cops showed up and something hit them. Granted, from the video, i couldn’t tell if it was intentional or not, but that also means that there was no way for the cops to know either. And I’m guessing that’s when the tear gas started. The video ended shortly after the cops reacted though so I’m not entirely sure. Also, of course they showed up in riot gear, nobody left when they were told to. I don’t think I’ve seen a single protest that didn’t end with a riot after they were told to leave. It’s standard procedure for them to prepare for a riot at that situation.

“Didn’t happen” https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xy4JCa60_ZQ

My tax dollars don’t go to Hamas 😘

Still waiting on the Oct 7 video Alberta

I doubt that. All of hamas infrastructure was bought with foreign aid money...

Why? Hamas are terrorists and my tax dollars don’t go to them 😘 Israel should stop stealing land, it isn’t complicated

You all support terrorism.

Stealing for safety? Not that complicated.

I HATE FRESHMEN

Is this actually from VCU?

As a sophomore, if you blatantly and knowingly went to a party while acting as if you’re immune to the virus, I actually think you deserve to get it. So fuck your ignorance.

I’m a freshman and I hate everyone here too

As much as I'm upset about me not being able to attened college for the second year in a row due to my loans being rejected, part of me is relieved I didn't go. I give it less than a month before they send everyone home

It’s one thing to be an idiot. It’s a whole another level to record you being a selfish idiot during a pandemic. Hope it was worth it for whatever clout they get (which it isn’t).

Anyone caught doing this should be kicked out of the university. If you have to be so selfish that you'd risk other people's lives just so you can party, fuck you.

THIS is why my vcu area business is closed. Thanks a LOT.

Ladies and gentleman, this is America.

Fucking dumb, like why

This bitch is dumb lmfaooo she deserves whatever she has coming

Honestly just seeing this just makes me cringe; how irresponsible can you be? I'm glad I graduated this past semester and fully moved out. :|

is that pikapps house?

bruh what the fucccckkkkkkk their mommies are paying for housing. What do they think is gonna happen to all the money they wasted on them when classes close in a week?

Send them to help in the ICU at VCU, maybe then they would take this pandemic seriously. People are fucking trash and fucking selfish. Fucking losers.

y'all just don't party. If there's a few people that have it they go into isolation and it's fine. The problem comes when they come into contact with who known how many people at a party.

It looks like it Edit: You can tell it is because that's the sidewalk near the engineering building

It is—the caption had #vcu and #gorams and an apology from the poster (but like... if you’re so sorry why are you posting this and even going to parties in the first place lmao)

just waiting for add drop to end so they can cash in!

She's going to get expelled. Just a guess.

They should be expelled and blacklisted for like a year so it shows up when they try to apply for a university in the spring.

That’s pike I recognize some of them in the video

Ban any frats that have parties Not to mention *all* the date rape

They're sorry they got caught

fucking pike why is it always pike

Cause they don’t give a fuck about anyone but themselves

They've always been like that since they incorporated at VCU. Their first three classes were fucking awful. Hasn't gotten any better from what I've heard.

You’re a 6 year veteran here. If you’ve ever seen Reddit get riled up about Greek life, someone *always* has a Pike story. Whether pike is known for taking their hazing too far and getting pledges seriously hurt, date rape, other stupid shit, etc; they have the reputation of the universally shitty frat.

What's amusing to me is that all the other Frats know, and have generally gone out of their way to distance themselves from PIKE. Fuck AKL threw down with them once for just being phenomenal shit bags at a party. Completely deserved it.

spike pike!

We ended up banning them from UMaine my senior year there haha

The Rick Ross special

Atty. Gen. Miyares Issued Memo for UVA and VCU Health to stop Youth Transgender Services According to News Channel 8, Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares is the one who initiated it: [Virginia Attorney General sends memo to VCU, UVA following executive order on gender-affirming care | WRIC ABC 8News](https://www.wric.com/news/politics/capitol-connection/virginia-attorney-general-sends-memo-to-vcu-uva-following-executive-order-on-gender-affirming-care/)

Let's see if ya'll turn out and vote. Everyone complains, but doesn't vote. America, the land of Apathetic

What terrifies me is when this extends to anti-Black racism. One of the main reasons I choose VCU social work is it's commitment to fighting racism, particularly anti-black racism and if the orders include not teaching critical race theory, or diversity, what does that even mean for the whole culture of VCU?

I’m so sorry this is happening. I hate it But finally-this article xplains so much. I really didn’t think VCU would go against the lgbtqi+ family just because. Politics suck ass. I hate this for all of us folks that know this is wrong.

Fuck him and anyone who agrees with this BS. Leave trans kids alone you absolute freaks.

They chose evil. I know folks have legitimate concerns about democrats, but General Miyares must be defeated next year.

Project 2025 states in two separate passages hundreds of pages apart: Give all pedophiles the death penalty (Page 554). And label all transgender as pedophiles (Page 5). https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24088042-project-2025s-mandate-for-leadership-the-conservative-promise/

Youngkin, Seares, and Miyares are all deeply evil ppl and we need to get them out of Richmond

Amazing how these assholes are so incredibly concerned with others sexuality and gender. If Rao had ethics he'd tell them to go to hell.

Is Carilion excluded because they are private?

Sweatervest Jr. Learned how to kiss trumps ass by watching Govenor Sweatervest do it

I want to know what I can do to fight this

This breaks my heart for transgender youth. They are not being “mutilated” and to use such incorrect language causes further pain and humiliation for these poor young people. This is all aimed at less than 1% of the population. They are vulnerable and GAC gives them hope and happiness. All because people are somehow afraid of others who are different. Study the science and leave politics out of this. Please. Their lives depend on it.

I know kids personally affected by this. We’re frantically trying to talk them off a ledge right now. I’m afraid my care will be next, even though I’m nearly 30 and began treatment a decade ago. “Under 19” was a very deliberate move to include legal adults in many states. If this goes to the Supreme Court I’m prepared to also lose access to the care that saved my life. It was never about protecting kids. Children will absolutely die because of this. “Nobody’s taking it away, they just have to wait.” I made three attempts on my life waiting to start my transition. It’s like telling juvenile diabetics they just need to wait for adulthood to have access to insulin. That’s how unreasonable this is. Kids will die. Exactly as planned.

Nobody wants to vote when its a choice between a slow death to America or a quick one

[ The VCU Health System is a distinct legal entity that operates VCU Medical Center and other healthcare facilities. It provides patient care, medical research, and clinical training. VCU (the university) is an academic institution that oversees various schools, including VCU School of Medicine, VCU School of Nursing, and others. While the two collaborate—especially in medical education and research—VCU Health System functions independently in terms of governance, finances, and operations.](https://about.finance.vcu.edu/all-funds-budget/hospital-services/#:~:text=Role%20of%20the%20VCU%20Health,%2C%20educational%2C%20and%20research%20activities.)

> and if the orders include not teaching critical race theory, or diversity, what does that even mean for the whole culture of VCU? Trump's recent executive order just bans certain divisive concepts, not whole subjects. Here is the section of the order defining the "discriminatory equity ideology" which the order bans. It does not mention Critical Race Theory per se but just concepts that it teaches: >Sec. 2. Definitions. >(b) “Discriminatory equity ideology” means an ideology that treats individuals as members of preferred or disfavored groups, rather than as individuals, and minimizes agency, merit, and capability in favor of immoral generalizations, including that: >(i) Members of one race, color, sex, or national origin are morally or inherently superior to members of another race, color, sex, or national origin; >(ii) An individual, by virtue of the individual’s race, color, sex, or national origin, is inherently racist, sexist, or oppressive, whether consciously or unconsciously; >(iii) An individual’s moral character or status as privileged, oppressing, or oppressed is primarily determined by the individual’s race, color, sex, or national origin; >(iv) Members of one race, color, sex, or national origin cannot and should not attempt to treat others without respect to their race, color, sex, or national origin; >(v) An individual, by virtue of the individual’s race, color, sex, or national origin, bears responsibility for, should feel guilt, anguish, or other forms of psychological distress because of, should be discriminated against, blamed, or stereotyped for, or should receive adverse treatment because of actions committed in the past by other members of the same race, color, sex, or national origin, in which the individual played no part; >(vi) An individual, by virtue of the individual’s race, color, sex, or national origin, should be discriminated against or receive adverse treatment to achieve diversity, equity, or inclusion; >(vii) Virtues such as merit, excellence, hard work, fairness, neutrality, objectivity, and racial colorblindness are racist or sexist or were created by members of a particular race, color, sex, or national origin to oppress members of another race, color, sex, or national origin; or >(viii) the United States is fundamentally racist, sexist, or otherwise discriminatory. https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/ending-radical-indoctrination-in-k-12-schooling/ Banning these concepts from public education should not be controversial. Note the phrase "Critical Race Theory" is absent from this part of the executive order.

But explain transgender "care" for teens.

They did. It’s a deeply illegal order.

That would effectively mean to kill all transgender people correct? How did a manifesto detailing literal murder plots ever see the light of day?

Deeply evil is a bit of an exaggeration don't you think?

They can ignore Miyares Memo that VCU and UVA have to follow since they are a private non-profit organization, but eventually they too will likely have to follow it otherwise they may be unable to receive federal funds including from things like Medicare and Medicaid, which would make it very difficult for them to continue to operate. Additionally, as insurance providers absolutely love to find ways to not pay anything out, they too will likely follow suit with the presidential executive order that's tied to all of this. Whether you are for or against this type of thing, there are going to be ramifications for everyone out there, and not just the kids seeking treatment...

Pray to St Luigi for guidance...

This is easier said than done but you can write to senators, protest, speak to your friends, and most importantly, vote!

Low effort comment/post

as in… going backwards to the 80’s and 90’s where only specific people had rights? yea i guess we are moving that way. very weird thing to be excited about.

Sounds like the pot calling the kettle a disphit here

Low effort comment/post

I don't even know how you can form sentences when you're licking other people's boots so hard.

Low effort comment/post

How does it feel to be so smooth brained you think they operate on children?

Puberty blockers are not sex changes. Were you about to lie that minors are receiving sex changes?

No one is "promoting" treatment for trans people, they are simply treating trans people where appropriate, except now when politicians and deluded Trumpersexuals get involved in patient treatment. These Republicans are so concerned with others genders and sexuality it seems it's a fetish.

You can’t make someone gay. Seriously, you ever tried to make someone gay? Let me know how it works for you.

That’s right I remember all the rights we all lost during Obama and Biden. Right? Like which ones? Can you remind me?

Yea as a trans person I remembered my identity being banned under Biden.

Stupid take

So he didn’t say the buzzwords, that means he’s talking about something completely different?

Puberty blockers are not surgery.

OK. It’s medical care for transgender teens. What’s hard to understand?

Without access to a patient’s records as well as possibly some testing, it would be impossible to form a reasonable course of treatment. If you have a more specific question, maybe someone here can help you with that.

You could try looking up the positions held by every major medical association on earth. Good place to start, as opposed to starting bad faith debates on Reddit. If you really cared to learn, you’d know this is widely accepted as medically necessary care that saves lives, and why. But y’all don’t actually give a fuck about these kids. And it shows.

Because too many people didn’t care enough to read the damn thing or even listen to summaries content creators did on it to inform their viewers.

Charges filed against VCU Health employee who admitted to making four false reports of sexual, aggravated assault

Behavior like this directly contributes to the upwards battle women face to report sexual assault.

what was the possible reason for lying repeatedly?

Doesn’t appear to say anything about whether she gets to keep her job

Imagine lying about sexual assault, thanks for making it harder for actual victims like myself to be believed.

I just wanna know why they keep protecting the persons name

Absolutely, makes it harder for actual victims. You have to be a sick person to lie for attention, revenge, or anything else

I think some people get a certain adrenaline rush or high from lying about traumatic events and the attention they get as a result

they want to go to jail

She will never be able to work in healthcare ever again with a criminal charge. Its safe to assume that.

Did you not read the article? The name is mentioned right away lol

What are you talking about? The person's name is stated in the second paragraph of the article

damn well they r surely getting the attention now💀

They deserve to go to jail for at least the amount of time their alleged offender would have faced, and also go into some lifelong data base. Fair is fair

Imagine ruining your career over lying about assault, wtaf

I believe she was charged with a misdemeanor, which does not cause for a revoking of her license, meaning she will be able to work in health care. I'm pretty sure she is either suspended from vcu or was fired

in the article i read it did not name them but i’ll look at others

Haha yes and ruining their life

Mental illness can be a fickle beast, it's not an excuse for what she did, but hopefully she gets the help she needs. VCU Employee

Probably an unpopular opinion but we blame EVERYTHING on mental illness in this day and age and it 100% detracts from holding people responsible for their actions. This makes them out to be some sort of victim when they absolutely are not in this scenario. Everyone deals with shit in life, some people just choose to be shitty and take it out on those around them.

No, stop blaming everything on mental illness

A well-adjusted mentally sound person doesn't do this kind of thing. Mental illness is a very broad sliding scale. And as I said, it doesn't excuse her actions. She should be and will be held accountable. But on top of that she needs counseling and therapy. And you mentioned that everyone deals with shit in life, yes, and the majority of us can work it out on our own without lashing out. Others: like this person, can't seem to control that part of themselves. Whether it be a chemical imbalance, generational trauma, social disorder, etc. It's never nothing.

We don’t even know the extent of the perps condition, or if there even is one besides just being a shitty person with a couple of screws loose. Like I said, jumping to conclusions that it must be some mental health problem instead of simply holding the person accountable is why we continue to have people like this that act out for attention. You might not mean to, but you’ve already created an excuse for them. Would you do that for someone who committed a violent crime? Someone that robbed a family? Probably not, but because of the circumstances surrounding this case, you’ve already created a narrative that aims to cushion the backlash towards this individual. She doesn’t need help right now, she needs consequences before she actually ruins someone else’s life. Just my thoughts on it, of course I’m not necessarily right.

But you just said “a couple screws loose”, lol. That is just language for mental health problem.

My exact thoughts!

You’re comparing repeatedly making 2 years of false accusations about sexual harassment, to a violent crime or robbery? I’m not seeing the connection.

Yeah, and like I said, I don’t care about her issues at the present time. She did something illegal and should face the repercussions before we start making her out to be a victim. A few screws loose can be applied to anyone committing a crime, because people under normal circumstances don’t do shit like this.

And like I have said twice so far, it is not an excuse.

I’m saying that if we tend to not excuse violent crime or robbery etc, why should we do anything different with crimes such as false reporting of sexual assault? A serious crime was committed and in this day and age, certain people tend to want to make a victim of the perpetrators. I’m saying that is a dumb way of approaching this because she is not a victim in this scenario.

No one said she shouldn’t face repercussions. But to compare to say… some one that is serving time for possession of heroin. Yes they should serve the time, but we achieve nothing if they are not given help for their addiction as well.

You are the only one saying victim here.

zoom university is the worst

Milk Chugging at the 7/11? Why was there a huge group of people chugging milk at the 7/11 on Grace late Saturday night? Picture for reference

It’s an annual thing, two volunteers chug a gallon of milk as fast as they can!

FUCK I MISSED IT NOOOOOO

Dang I missed out

Man I missed it?? When do they decide when its going to happen??

So 6 more weeks of winter?

I am the guy in the green blazer chugging the almond milk, I literally heard about it the day before. It was a flash in the pan, but was really fun. Apparently a few of my buddies there had been practicing for it all week.

This used to take place in the commons back in the day. I watched a dude chug a gallon and then hurl it back up into a massive garbage can. Good times.

we did this multiple times in the dorms freshman year (2002). i was the only person to get the whole gallon down in the hour but couldn't keep it down the required 5min. it's a brutal challenge.

damn i was right by it 😭😭

This is what community is about

Gallon challenge

Why do they do this?!?!?

Vcu isn’t real

Looks like fun

Okay so what about the armed guards w/ guns and riot vests?

kiss me and touch me a little bit

Cops being nosey

staying in richmond another year JUST for milk fight

To the student in my Circuits class who posted the exam questions on Chegg and caused the rest of our exams to be changed from a 15 hour open note exam to a 50 minute in class timed exam Fuck you

Exactly this. This is why I hate cheaters who say “mind your own business, it doesn’t affect you, it’s my choice” — it affects the whole class. It affects the people who take this class next semester. It affects the professor. Please don’t cheat.

Your exam was even open notes bruh I’m so sorry this happened to your class :(

Cheating is wrong, don’t cheat

If they'd name the offending parties I bet a couple of beat-downs would put and end to this.

Why do people still post stuff on chegg, it’s literally so easy to get caught especially now. SMH

Not sure if this counts, but I’m in the rad sci program and I know someone from last year’s class bragged about never buying the textbook to one of our professors and she made the class infinitely harder by watering down her lectures to force us to read the book. The tests results were almost always abysmal since the majority of it was hardly covered in class. Its a 7-point grading scale and most of us barely passed with a B.

206 with Cabral. He's a nice and great professor, but he looked pretty disappointed with this

Oof, that’s really frustrating

Probably looked disappointed because he’s a super nice professor and more than helpful if you ask him. People are just lazy

Chilling at Monroe Park. Hope to be at VCU next year!

It’s a wonderful place, hope you join the ram-ily soon!!

good luck homie 🫶 what are you looking to major in?

I hope you enjoy it! I love this school!

VCU next year? From Monroe Park? How slow are you walking??

Good luck!!!

It's a great school. You're going to love it

engineering

this comment makes no sense, monroe park is on the campus

U have a lovely Reddit avatar

Which discipline? Good luck!

Shameless plug but be sure to join Ram Rocketry! There should be a fundraiser at Halal munchies if you wanna talk to some of the folks.

very mature of you

A badge of honor. He will be your boss one day.

probably mechanical but i might do biomedical

sorry it’s hard to tell if a comment on reddit is satire or plain stupid

I’m a biometrics engineer

I graduated mechanical 2022. Do that. I don’t know if any of my biomed buddies have jobs right now…

do not do BME unless you absolutely know you want to go to med school

oh hey!! i'm a future biomedical engineering transfer. (i also want to minor in rehab science and do research for rare and genetic diseases, as well as women's health. There's alot i want to do) i wish you good luck, VCU has a good medical program.

I mean that one was pretty obvious.

that's kind of the state of the entire job market though

well i can be stupid too

He will be your boss one day.

“Dr. Rao, how do you plan on keeping your students safe and healthy during these times?”

We all know he’s just waiting to send kids home until he gets in as much money as possible. But how the fuck can we make him answer for this BS? Like it’s all of us vs him. What can we do?

Starting a petition to make him resign might be a good idea? Just a thought. Others might have better ideas.

I doubt it's just him saying VCU should remain open/on campus learning. Don't they all hold a meeting and vote on it? No way one man has that kinda power

Strange guy There’s a weird guy asking girls to read a note on his phone where he goes on about having a stutter issue and how he’s mad about how women won’t get in a relationship with him. It’s awkward and creepy and hard to mumble your way out of. Watch out. Definitely a student and I am not saying this to make fun of him, it was just a freaky situation for me. That’s not the way to make friends or a girlfriend. That scares people more than anything to be confronted randomly like that and have to read a long message while you are observed doing so and then have to brush you off

around 12 ish a group of people he asked called campus police and gave a description and where we last saw him i had to go to a class but my friend talked to security in person and theyre keeping an eye out

He isn't a student at VCU, I ran into him the other day

Sorry just got shaken up

My friend just texted me about this, it sounds so weird I’m gonna warn people as much as i can

where was this/what did he look like

I saw him doing this to a girl today outside of the commons. I was doing work at a table nearby so I wasn’t listening intently to the conversation but he had her read that note off his phone and it just looked like a super uncomfortable encounter. I thought it was a one off incident but this is super weird

Report him if you see him doing this again.

What backpack is he wearing? Bc someone that kinda matches this description had a teenage mutant ninja turtle backpack and he was staring me tf down it was so weird

I'm so sorry man, I hope you're feeling okay.

Yeah the same guy came up to me and a group of friends. I agree that it didn't feel dangerous just really uncomfortable. Kept calling women "females" and talking about how they're not getting into a relationship. We tried to just send him away but it was pretty jarring.

I am the one who called campus police on him. he was harassing my friend and i and i witnessed him harass at least 5 other women. it was very unsettling and when i told him my friend was married and that i am gay (which are both true) he got very upset, grabbed his phone from me, and walked off. i shouldn’t have to feel unsafe on my own college campus in the middle of the day while eating lunch with my friend before class. i was outside the commons when he approached us, and he had already approached my friend earlier in the day before i met up with her. she called her husband because she felt so uncomfortable and scared.

Did he have glasses?

![gif](giphy|PXcekGdxQ7nN7C84rn) HELL NA

Just based on the title I was gonna say "it's VCU, everyone around here is a bit strange". But then I read the post and... yeah, call someone about that

Or maybe he is neurodivergent… give people a little grace.

I will if I see him doing this again to anyone, at this current point I’m not sure campus security would really take it seriously as there was no threat or harm and I don’t have a good description

What’s his fetish? Emasculating himself in front of strange women? Sabotaging any chance he might have at actually spending time with a female? Let me know…I’m really quite curious what the appeal in such behaviors could possibly be.

Thanks for letting me know. That’s reassuring to know they are keeping an eye out

Extremely creepy in that case, I could at least understand more if it was a socially awkward freshman or something

I was assuming he was probably doing it to other girls (using my knowledge of how people work) but this actually confirms it. I had no way of knowing until this comment but now I know it wasn’t just me. It’s clearly a cycle. I hope this behavior stops!

Dude of color. Didn’t seem dangerous, just a shy meek kid but you never know with people. It was going down N Laurel Street towards W Cary I believe or around there. Had a backpack on. I was avoiding eye contact so don’t have a lot of detail. Definitely college aged Btw I didn’t feel like he was dangerous im just warning other women to avoid an uncomfortable situation

I was also not sure if it was just me, I sort of just assumed he probably did it to others and the comments here proved that to me

Will do if I see him doing it again

I don’t remember unfortunately :( that rings a bell but I can’t confirm it

he didnt have a backpack at all. a few ppl ik have said that he doesnt even go to vcu

Yeah I was just taking a walk before class and ran into him. Was too freaked out to continue the walk and I RUSHED to commons to sit in there for like 20 minutes. Kept looking back to see if he was following me or something. Was honestly half expecting him to pull out a gun or something cuz people are crazy, but thank god he didn’t (I was alone and not in a super busy part of campus, my location is in another comment)

I don’t think so? I was avoiding eye contact and staring at his phone so I may have missed it. I don’t recall but it’s possible

Ok, maybe he is. People still feel extremely uncomfortable around him.

what's he look like? does he go around the park, maybe i'll take photos of him and report to the police near us or someone who can handle this situation.

Yes. Some people genuinely get sexual gratification from being ashamed

i also got his instagram, as i was with a group of girls and i wanted to diffuse the situation ... i dont feel comfortable posting it on the subreddit but i'd be happy to dm it to you

That’s crazy ! Don’t be afraid to be confident and don’t give them the time of day. Men like him take advantage of kind women like us

He had a backpack in the morning when i saw him.

And neurodivergent people feel uncomfortable around you. You’ll live. Life is full of challenges.

I have the best description I could give at the time in another comment on this post. I wish I had more detail. I should’ve taken a photo

Especially since it wasn’t just a one off with me, he seems to have been doing this for days and just today has had multiple encounters

You talked to him?

Yes I’ll dm

could u dm it to me as well?

do you mind sending it to me? im planning to make a post on yikyak, and it may help the general vcu community who uses that app.

i hope OP takes this to heart. it can feel awkward and terrible to do, but there is actually nothing wrong with just keeping your eyes forward and ignoring people like this entirely. they are violating YOUR space, not the other way around.

i see he didnt have a backpack anymore at like 11:30 ish and he was wandering the commons area

Buddy, I AM NEURODIVERGENT.

all good, if i see him around doing that i'll take a photo and thanks for the post, this dude sounds manipulative and a creep, pretty sure he knows what he's doing and is playing a mind game.

What’s yikyak

Yeah, I understand. Definitely should have just walked along in retrospect. Usually would, not sure why I didn’t this time but it was my bad

It was the only thing i noticed about him fully, thus why I thought he was a student. Otherwise i was avoiding looking at him. You may be right when you saw him, but i did see him in the morning

Join the club. Is this supposed to be a mic-drop moment?

I'm glad you're having your coming out party.

Best places to cry on campus Ideally between the commons and Shafer. I am having a rough day already and deserve a solid 5 minute cry break. 🤣 my car is literally a mile away Edit: thank you everyone. I have reserved a library room to cry. Will let you know how it goes Edit 2: library study room was great 10/10 would recommend. And if you just need to disassociate at the disco it also works super well.

Book a room at the library!

The commons has bathrooms in the underground. They are pretty out of the way of usual foot traffic so I think they'd be solitary. I would recommend reserving a room in the library, but stick to the first floor because the 2nd floor rooms are made of windows. Put a piece of paper on the door facing out saying the room is reserved so no one tries to barge in and interrupt you

Valid ass post 💯🔥 been there done that.

Depending on how low you cry, 3rd floor stacks in the library. Usually pretty deserted.

on the commons second floor I think there is an individual bathroom

there is a gender neutral bathroom on the third floor of the library near the elevators i’ve never seen anyone use. hope you feel better soon!

I would say anywhere. We’re all in the same boat

basement level of the library sort of behind the staircase there’s a tucked away hall with lots of staff, custodial rooms, vending machines etc. and a couple bathrooms. Highly recommended it’s always a ghost town

If you’re going to cry on campus you might as well go big. Have a friend let you into the art school and at the top floor is the garden. I’ve never been there during normal hours but the art building is 24/7, so at late night or early morning it’s pretty empty besides the chill security guy and janitors. Great spot to just go sit and feel like absolute dog crap. You can also just go and study there if you need to. However, the best time is during sunrise or sunset to get a pretty view and feel better about yourself and how your a failure and stuff. 10/10 def recommend.

Best wishes stay strong!

tbh theres a little seating area behind the library next to the music building. its a good place to sit and cry for a second

4th floor stacks in the library. The stairwells in the rear are normally deserted. That or the old library used to have basement classrooms that were generally unoccupied/ plenty of places. Generally I'd say just find a stairwell and go to the top, or basement floors

roof garden of the art building

In the Pollack Building I remember everyone crying on the balconies. They're pretty private.

Letting it all out in the open is super freeing tbh. I have no shame anymore

The area in front of the Anderson Gallery(it's near Hibbs so it's not too far from where you stated).

Just make sure it’s not on the quiet floor. I forget which one that is

I might go to the toilet

Anywhere, we can all relate.

Avoid crying in the 4th floor library bathroom. I was there today and would not recommend, although it worked in a pinch. Too bad I didn't see this post yesterday

Crying space?? WTF is wrong with you people?

You’re dorm or off campus

You’re gonna struggle in the workforce if you can’t make it through the day without crying.

Reserving a room at the library to cry is so funny to me. I might just do it 🤣

Done this many a time, also 2 nap

Are they not see through

This is also the ideal place to poop

I don’t recommend crying on a quiet floor

I used to call this place the labyrinth when I had a class down here and it took a good 30 minutes for me to find so I think that tells you all you need to know

Where is the art school located?

Thank you! It was a rough day, but I’ll be okay 🙂

Or if your grandma dies the day after rush you can stand in the nook of one of the columns in front of Harris while everyone leaves lecture

That’s honestly so iconic of you

Oh noooo people have feelingssss. Aaaaa hissss save us

Homie I’m a full adult with two children. I’ve been in the workforce and am now back in school getting a degree too. Sometimes even the baddest bitch has a bad day though.

This is a brain dead comment. Sensing positive vibes your way OP.

OP didn’t say anywhere that they can’t make it through a day without crying. Also why can’t you cry in the workforce? Plenty of people have rough jobs and need a cry break in their car

My dumbass didn’t fully process the crying in the bathroom part and I totally thought you were saying the 1st floor study rooms are ideal places to poop

That's why I said it depends on how loudly you cry. Some of us can keep it together and not be disruptive.

If that ever happens to me, I’ll keep it in mind. I’m really sorry about your grandma tho

Same but I found out my Dad had cancer (he's doing great now) Had a nice dramatic cry there too I'm sorry about your grandma

Lol..cry me a river!

I’m also a full adult 10+ years into the work force and I am speaking from experience. Been on the hiring side, firing side and deciding who to promote. Emotional instability is something to be kept as private as possible for your own protection.

It’s reality.

Just know crying at work will hold you back from advancing. No one wants someone who can’t handle pressure in leadership.

Thanks yall it was 2016 so thankfully awhile ago now but the spot remains tried and true!!

You can call me the crybaby of VCU 🤪

And anonymously trolling someone on the internet who’s being a bit vulnerable is a true sign of strength, right? Keep it up, buddy. I’m sure your coworkers think you’re the shit!

Maybe your reality. I've been in the workforce since 1992...

Can you guys walk any slower Jesus Christ get out of the way

what, you got somewhere to be or something?

Preach brotha

Facts llike I live 30-45 minutes away in the suburbs somewhere but the few times I come to vcu to run an errand all the students outside, three girls in a group blocking the way walking slow as hell and I have to get on the street to pass them

haha where are you from

YES!!! Lately I’ve been trying to walk around campus, either going to class or at one of my on-campus jobs, and everyone has their phone in their hand and nearly runs into me. Like do whatever you want on your phone but please just pay attention, lol.

it’s cause ppl are usually looking at their phones 🙃 just like trying to drive on a road

yes, if u want me to

And please walk in groups of three side by side as you do it so there is absolutely no room to pass you

I'm literally disabled so no

Typically when someone asks me that we’re talking over dinner

VCU rises to No. 69 in U.S News & World Report’s new ranking of the nation’s top public universities 69 Nice.

I went to a top 100 university!

How much did VCU pay for that? https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/06/us/college-rankings-us-news.html

yet we have a 91% acceptance rate 😭

Pussy pussy pussy marijuana!!😂😂😂

It says 136th when I googled it

Charges dropped against pro-Palestine demonstrators arrested at VCU

It is stories like this that just makes it seem exactly like the only reason for state violence was to scare anyone else from ever speaking out. Thankful they won’t be charged, but if it isn’t a crime now, why was it treated like a crime then

Good. We need our entire country to protest against Israeli strategy and stop the murdering of innocent Palestinians. As well as stopping the murdering of innocent Lebanese people.

So do you feel different if they are students vs not? Some of the non students seem to push students to do things that they would not do. “Hey do this to protest, imma sit over here” is my impression. Is that wrong? Seems like some of the folks they just want to stir trouble mix in.

yeah you’re wrong. it was VCU kids who did the organizing. some community members showed up to support bc VCU kids on social media were specifically asking for more ppl to show up. you should look up the history of the outside agitator myth. it was used against MLK at the time too. it’s a way to discredit movements

preach it 💅. also the "kids don't know anything" narrative is super ageist. look at people like malala, greta, marley dias, xiuhtezcatl martinez, claudette colvin, etc. they were all kids/young people who were/are activists and have made a major difference, and/or are continuing to work towards freedom and liberation for all.

i see no lies

LITERALLY LMAO

Got the Bieber Fever

Hibbs hall is scary

If you think this is scary, the food that used to be served there was way worse.

My brother's freshman year roommate's brother died falling down a stair well like that. I always think about that when I see stairwells like this

Bathrooms there too

When I came to VCU in 1987, you could smoke in the Hibbs Dining Hall. It was gnarly.

I refuse to take those stairs

I smoked so many cigarettes there in the '90s

Are there any remnants of what was the dining hall?

every time i go to a class in hibbs i get sleepy. i think there’s mold in it

Thank goodness I ate in an almost brand new Shaffer, but I heard all about the Hibbie Jibbies.

Wait what😭they used to have food?

Hibbs Belly was a real thing. Also, bookstore in the basement.

You beat me to it!

*Repressed memory unlocked.*

Omg thats horrific. My heart dropped every time i looked over the stairwell from the top.

Omg why is it so dark in there. What did english majors do to deserve this

I forget which floor had a glory hole, but I think it was the third floor.

Up until ~2000, you could walk in smoking, put out your cigarette in the ash tray between the elevators and head on up to class. The downstairs/basement area before it was renovated, there too. Don't forget about the dedicated room in the SoB (now Harris) they made after curbing some of the everywhere smoking.

When I went there in the 80s, I wouldn't take the elevator because they were always getting stuck. It was a problem in a lot of the buildings back then. Does it still happen?

Tell us more about

It was god awful, but I ate a lot and gained 15lbs

Yeah. Where Shafer is now, that used to be the old biology building. Two floors, kinda blue. The library looked much different then too. Hibbs, looked the same on the exterior. Anyhow, the main dining hall was on the first floor, staff on the second. Anyone could use the staff one, better food, but shorter hours. This all being said, back in the late 90s there wasn't really like "choices" for food. Nothing like what Shafer is now. Weekends were limited to such glorious options as boiled hot dogs, creamed corn, or you could go get some cereal. That was risky, the milk temp gauge was commonly pegged in the red. Pretty much a guaranteed bowel movement thereafter, affectionately referred to as getting your PHD (post Hibbs dump). It was a miracle when they brought in a rotisserie chicken cooker. At first, they'd give you a whole bird. If you were smart, you'd cut it up, stock away some in tupperware and take it to the dorm fridge so the weekends weren't awful. Second floor staff room subs were pretty good, the lady that made them was cool as hell.

We always called it the PhD (post-Hibbs dump). A bunch of us learned the hard way that you didn’t eat the sliced ham from the upstairs Hibbs sandwich bar. We all got food poisoning.

One time the automatic lights wouldn't even turn on. Someone was in a stall in the dark for a bit lol

prolly one of the most hated majors lmao.

Oh my god?? No. I haven’t gotten stuck yet, but I’m claustrophobic, so I hope it never happens

I got stuck in 2003. Missed my morning English class. Good times.

All you can eat BLTs for $1.90

That's good! Maybe they finally fixed them after 40 years.

We the People reject Project 2025 Peaceful protest at capital square on Feb 5th! Speak the word!!!

I shared this in the Megathread in the r/rva subreddit, but if you go to this thing you will be able to hear the VCU Siren Test that starts at Noon on the 5th because the Medical Campus is right next to the Virginia State Capital, so don't freak out...

Why is it during work hours haha. I’d go but in the middle of the day on a Wednesday is crazy.

If you’re going to this put your phone is faraday bag, or leave it at home, wear a mask. We live in a fascist country now expect a response.

It was a low turnout

You’re going to have to disenfranchise the people funding it. A giant protest may delay it, but it will just change names and comeback.

Unfortunately your government doesn’t care, and nobody is going to do a damn thing about it besides standing around in the cold.

Well shit. Just saw this today. If y’all organize again I’ll def be there

Too bad. Trump is president 🥳🥳🥳

Trump won the popular vote, so, we kinda DONT reject it. Technically my

Project 2025 said it was going to get rid of all the legal immigrants yeah? And now we’re expanding H1B? You’d think people would be happy project 2025 isn’t trump’s actual plan but nope. The conspiracy needs to be real

My man, motherfucker

Have you actually read through any of the goals of Project 2025 on their website? If you haven't read it, please do and come back to reply to this comment. Which of those goals do you disagree with?

It’s a part of r/50501 but I agree it kinda strange to have it in the middle of the work day

It’s in the middle of the day so people working in that area will see the protest, although a lot of the times they send people home if they know a protest will be happening in the area

I wonder why 😆

Wow you must be miserable to be around

Do you even go to VCU?

Be excellent to each other.

H1B allows companies to essentially have indentured servants.

Fair enough

I doubt that. They probably just have an hourly job or are going to participate on their lunch break haha. The unemployment rate in Richmond is lower than the national average.

Hate to burst your bubble. I have a job. I went.

77M to 75M, yes he did win the popular vote. He didn't win it in '16, this is true.

You’re correct. It still contradicts the project 2025 idea though, doesn’t it?

Not just reversing LGBTQ rights, there is a set of clauses in there specifically designed to kill LGBTQ people. It labels all LGBTQ people as porn producers, labels all porn producers as Pedophiles, and then sentences all Pedophiles to death.

Be excellent to each other.

No because they want to have their cake and eat it too. They want the cheap exploitable labor that comes with H1B while simultaneously blaming everything on immigrants.

Perfect! :) that is 100% accurate. Protect our kids

I was followed by man on campus. Here's his description I called the VCUPD non-emergency line and reported this. Yesterday around 1:30 I was followed for a few blocks by an older white man. He was bald, blue gingham button down shirt, navy laptop case with a handle, and tan (?) pants. He also was of medium build and had a short white beard. I'm very experienced with cities and have lived in them my whole life. I just had this deep feeling in my gut about him that I couldn't explain. He was already speaking to a girl who looked uncomfortable as I walked past in Monroe park. I assumed maybe he was asking for directions, money, ect. Normal yet uncomfortable city interactions. He started to walk behind me sometime after I passed. He stopped another girl to ask her something, then went back to following me. This was on Laurel. he caught me at the light and started to walk very close. I decided to walk into blue bones vintage and assumed he wouldn't follow me there. Honestly, I thought I was being paranoid, but he did. When the man was distracted looking at something, I quietly told the guy behind the register that he kept trying to talk to girls and was possibly following me. He looked pretty stoned and just nodded. I asked what to do and he shrugged. go figure. I sighed and left the store with the old man following behind. once I turned the corner on broad I began to run to put some space between us. Once he rounded the corner he stood for a moment looking around. We accidentally made eye contact and he started walking in my direction. I made it to my building before he caught up to me and called the non-emergency line. I don't want to scare anyone by sharing this story. Its just important to me that I share incase anyone sees him or has had a similar experience. It may have been nothing, but its important to trust your gut. Thank you. EDIT: this was at 1:30 PM in broad daylight and I was going to a class. And yes I am a college aged young woman. Thank you to those who have asked if I’m okay - I really appreciate. I must ask that before you think about commenting something I may have done wrong, please be understanding of the fact that I was very scared while still asserting myself. I also think I handled it pretty well considering the circumstance 😅

If something like that happens again, try to keep your head and look along nearby walls for a yellow VCU police call box. Some of them have a yellow light on them. It was a good idea to head for the nearest busy street. If you're on a sidestreet and it's safe to do so, go to the middle of the street. It'll look weird if he follows. There's a little VCU police office on Grace next to Au Bon Pain. You might stop in there and give them a heads-up about him. The officers there know the neighborhood regulars and they can keep an eye out for him. Run by Barnes and Noble. I think I saw pepper spray there near the breezeway entrance. A whistle might be handy, also. If you blew a whistle at him, he'd probably go away. Sorry that happened to you, I know it's unnerving. There's an apartment building full of old people on Grace. He could be a dirty old man with dementia. Probably harmless but best not to find out.

How old did he look?

Thank you for sharing your story- I can’t imagine how scared you must have been and I commend you for doing such a great job with the description and protecting yourself to the best of your abilities. How are you feeling since this happened?

You did a great job. Being loud and aggressive saying STOP FOLLOWING ME once it becomes inconvenient or upsetting to you is also acceptable. I have the feeling people like this don't want their quarry to make a scene.

Crime junkie motto: Be weird. Be rude. Stay alive. Make a scene, be annoying. Draw attention.

gurlllll get you a knife. it’s so fucked up that women have to walk around scared as hell and at risk for danger all the time. sooo so glad you’re safe and thanks for sharing

eye contact can be okay to a certain degree. don't look shy, as this could come across as encouraging his behavior. don't prolong eye contact, just brief enough to be clear and assertive. also, don't be afraid to be a bit vocal (not violent or rude, just be assertive). turn around, look him in the eyes, and yell "stop following me!" not only will this hopefully deter him, but it will also let people nearby know what's going on.

I’m so sorry this happened to you! It’s so scary to be followed. It is a shame the store clerk didn’t help you when you needed it. Just be very vigilant when leaving/coming home, and try to switch up your routine, just in case he is the stalker type. Hope that was your only encounter you’ll ever have with him!

I am so sorry this happened to you ❤️

Sorry you had to deal with that, glad to hear you got away unscathed!! Creeps are the worst, I'll watch out for anyone w his description...

im curious to if he was wearing boots? or usually wears a button down shirt and brown boots. ive seen a man with that description walking around. i was by myself meeting friends at the known thrift store around vcu (im not sure of the name but im pretty sure its rumors). i was walking from my dorm, gladding residence center, around 4pm i think and as im passing monroe park i saw that man AGAIN, with that description, about late 50's to 60's im assuming, he stared at me literally just staring into my soul and he started walking the direction i was going. he kept following me but he kept matching my speed, i kept walking faster and faster and then slower and he kept doing the same. i was passing the taco place thats otw to the thrift store right before you turn the corner and i thank god saw one of my friends walking. it was a relief seeing him instead of my girl friends i was meeting up with because i dont think he would've left if he saw us. it was my guy friend i ran into and hes more on the intimidating side of physical appearance. its weird to say but hes on the tall and lowkey like super built buff guy type of beat and i told him if about the guy and we both turned around and made eye contact with him and the guy i think was pretending to take a phone call? and turned around and walked the other direction. i think he scared him off which thank god . mind you this was atleast the 3rd time ive seen him. he lingers around monroe park like around the outside of the park. i havent brought this up with any of my friends but then i saw this post and i think we saw the same man.

If this happens again, stay in whatever store you go into and call the police or 911 immediately. Posting here probably won't do much since very few VCU students (comparatively) are in here.

Id post this on the r/rva sub it’ll probably be seen more

As someone who lived in NYC , some guy was taking pics of me on the subway once. Get LOUD this will scare off predators. Publicly shame them

Def cross post this to r/rva. Glad you’re ok, always trust your gut! Did you give a report to an officer? Once they take a report they can probably pull footage from around campus.

Thanks for sharing this!! Out of curiosity was it 1:30am? Or pm

I make sure I have pepper spray at all time on campus !

policedept@vcu.edu You need to email what happened so it's public record and it doesn't get lost in the shuffle.

I'll keep an eye out. I'm at Grace and Harrison.

If you have to call the cops, Never bother with a non emergency line.

Just dm me n I’ll pull up and put the fear of god into him

Go back to the shop and put that stoned asshole on blast.

Is there still a police station in the building in the center of Monroe Park? Please be careful. Maybe get a birdie alarm.

Genuinely curious, why leave Blue Bones and not call the police right there and then? While they can't do anything to him without proof of him stalking you, you'd at least have been given an opportunity to get back home without him knowing where you live

Leading him to your house is the worst possible decision you could have made

Just wanted to know if you had a moment to talk about your cars extended warranty.

Thank you so much. I do have pepper spray and was holding it but he didn’t seem to notice. I completely agree with you he could’ve been harmless but it was best not to find out. Good note about the call box!

It's called Dominion Place and it's low income housing. Yes, it has old people and mentally challenged people. It also attracts ne'er do wells from Carver and the Courts who are " visiting" relatives. By all means go to the front desk and provide descriptions of people you feel may be living there if they are acting suspiciously. Laurel and Broad is a bit afar for most residents.

60's I think

I appreciate this comment so much! Seriously, thank you for asking. I feel pretty okay. I took a RamSafe home that night and will probably do so again after studying at the lib this evening. Thank you for your words and lack of judgement.

Thank you so much!

Love this. Thank you!

Thank you sm! I have some pepper spray but I think im gonna invest in one of those alarm thingies 😭

Thank you so much! This is good advice. And I appreciate you noticing the store clerk being unhelpful. I’m gonna switch up my routine on the walk tomorrow because of this comment :)

Thank you so much ❤️. I feel pretty confident about walking to the same class tomorrow so yay!

Thank you ❤️

Omg it could be the same guy! The walking close is very familiar. I can’t say I saw his shoes though. I’m pretty tall for a girl (5’10) and he was a bit smaller than me. But the location is the exact same! I’m so sorry he made you uncomfortable and I’m glad you’re okay! I would suggest calling the non-emergency line to submit a suspicious person report. Stay safe out there ❤️

I understand I just thought posting it would be the right thing to do just incase.

I did! Thank you ❤️

It was pm. Thank you!

Yep! I had it out the whole time

I had already made it to the building where my class was with security at the door. I wasn’t in danger, just reporting a suspicious person. I know I don’t have to justify myself to every comment that’s told me what I did wrong, but I think there must be a miscommunication there

Vcu police is an ok option but most of the time unless he’s committing a crime it’s hard to do much about it, some things have to be handled more bluntly (without committing a crime yourself ofc)

Yes but it doesn’t really seem open? It’s got a coffee shop under it that’s usually closed. I’ll check out the birdie alarm. Thx!

Sometimes when you’re scared shitless you can’t always think of the most reasonable solution that a third party when time to ponder the options would have

He was also in the blue bones and I was pretty freaked. I didn’t think it was a good idea to give his description while he was right in front of me. I also kind of thought the guy behind the register would ask him to leave so I could’ve called, or help me out somehow lol. Wishful thinking I suppose

It was my class with a security guard at the door dingus

Next time someone invades your safety let us know in detail how it went so we can pick apart everything you did ❤️

How about we not shame people

One of the most unfair things about it our world is that people simply don’t believe us (I’m assuming you’re a woman), and always consider the victim to have done something wrong or lacking common sense- pushing the blame back on you. Often times it feels like YOU, the victim is the one in trouble when reporting a crime in any capacity. You get asked questions posed in a way which make it seem like you did the wrong thing, or there was more you should have done/thought of at the time. Please know that you did nothing wrong, someone followed YOU. I’m so glad to hear you’re taking advantage of the resources and honestly, use the hell out of them! Tuition is expensive- get after it. Let me know if you need anything- I’m proud of you and commend you for being so brave

Not sure how relatable this is

it started as serious questions but now it's people asking me what my mario kart main is

I ran outta questions like last month

Way too relatable (i'm talking to you bio 151)

Me but with discussion board posts 😐

My classmates ask topic-related questions and my little brain asks “what letter would you remove from the alphabet”

i hate this so much i dread it every week :/

I just comment on friends posts

Tfw your professor deletes the thread you replied to and then gives you a zero for it

professors need to chill at this point srsly

daisy is my ride or die

You sound like a really fun person

Not giving any suggestion, I'm referring to me and myself only, think next time before you post.

Rao is full of shit VCU has been completely silent for months about the protests. No statement when Commonwealth Times reporters were pepper sprayed and arrested. No statement when VCU students were pulled off the streets by unmarked police vans on May 31st. No statement when hundreds of students and thousands of Richmonders were tear gassed in an incident so unjustified that the mayor apologized and fired the police chief. But now, a university that makes over 1 billion dollars a semester from tuition alone, is outraged over some broken windows and fucked up patio furniture? Give me a break. For y’all that don’t live here, there’s been 2 months of peaceful protests and 3 days of actual violence (May 29th, May 30th, and July 26th). Almost all of the violence has been caused by RPD just shooting teargas indiscriminately into crowds of people. If you don’t believe me, I was there and I have weeks of videos, @GoadGatsby and @aeringle have even more. If you didn’t already know, VCU’s “diversity” bullshit is a gimmick. This school doesn’t care if you’re poor, a minority, or queer. All it cares about is if you can pay it’s outrageous tuition so it can buy new buildings on Broad St. If you don’t agree with the protests, whatever, you’re in the minority on this campus and in this country. However, don’t let VCU’s bullshit statements be the thing that sways you. It’s not the full story, and it’s certainly not from a university that cares about its students.

Vcu has never cared about anything other than your money. The sad part is, the same goes for almost every for profit college in the USA. The education system is fucked and only exists to empty our pockets and leave us in debt.

in addition to them offering no support i CANNOT give a rats ass about the “damages that could cost more than $100,000” as that is less than 1/10th of raos salary

Also them outright saying that $100,000 in damage (on buildings that are certainly insured) is more important than police brutality and black lives is shameful.

It’s been fuck Rao and VCU. They’ve been getting away with this shit for too damn long.

I thought Rao and VCU did release a statement when protests started, I remember reading an email from them if I’m not mistaken? **edit: I 100% support BLM and am an activist myself, but I do think vcu sent out an email/letter awhile back

"aha nooo wont somebody think of the windows feelings :( ?" - rao probably the amt of people i saw type shit like "the damage from yesterdays riot [frown emoji] i dont understand why people wanna resort to violence, its so sad" like lmao? its fucking something else man, god forbid someone hurts the precious windows feelings

Also pressing charges! You know those might be your students.

Not like students care about diversity either. It's just a superficial face.

Let me get this straight. People are fighting in the streets, burning down cars and buildings, all the business on broad street are boarded up, Smashing windows of innocent people, vandalizing buildings, and breaking and entering. But y’all are mad at Rao? Richmond is in a shitty place right now and nobody is going to want to come to college here with what’s going on.

Destroying other people's property is wrong, no matter what the alleged excuse might be.

“This property is probably insured so I’m justified in destroying it” is a very bad mentality to have. Also, what does destroying innocent people’s property and burning down shit accomplish for ending police brutality?

I mean, VCU police have gone to bat for known antisemites like Derrick Davis.

It wasn't. BLM757 led the crowd into monroe park and out of it but once people found out who they were they dispersed and did their own thing. Also these white supremacists work with the police openly so I kinda doubt that the people doing this was them Furthermore stop trusting RPD. We're protesting them for a reason. Take what they say with a grain of salt cause they always try to make themselves look better. Remember back in June when they tear gassed people before curfew and said it was cause they were provoked?

Listen, bootlicker, none of that shit is happening here. No one is fighting in the streets. The only shit that’s been burned is trash cans and 3 vehicles that all belonged to the state. Nobody’s homes or apartments got burned down, the Richmond Fire Department came out and said the police were lying about the arson accusations. The only actual damage committed to the city was caused on May 30th, a day where the entire fucking country was rioting. Richmond is not a shitty place. It’s a place where thousands of us have come together to protest an unjust system and police department. It’s a place where ex-confederate monuments have been turned into community spaces where people play basketball and distribute food to the needy. It’s a place where we’re confronting our painful past, rather than hiding from it. If YOU are uncomfortable at the concept of black liberation at any cost, then nobody could care less. You’re naive to think this 350+ year old struggle is going to be completely peaceful, especially when the police violently oppress large peaceful protests (June 1st). It’s obvious that you’re ignoring the larger issue of black oppression and injustice to focus on broken windows and non-existent “fighting in the streets.” You have nothing productive, accurate, or nuanced to bring to conversation. Rather, you’re spewing lies and advancing anti-black talking points. Get the fuck off my post.

No shit. That’s not what his comment is about.

VCU is a state institution that exists because of public funds - if the public wants to destroy parts of VCU's campus as part of a broader attempt to precipitate change, I'm sure as fuck not going to sit around tut-tutting about the costs of replacing windows, and the only people who are don't have any interest in seeing the movement succeed. eat shit.

“BuT wHaT aBoUt LaW aNd OrDeR?!” is a very bad mentality to have. Maybe you haven’t noticed but “law and order” and “protecting property” is literally an excuse for silencing and killing black people in this country. Throughout history “law and order” only ever protects the ruling class. VCU as an institution has done great harm to the minority communities in Richmond so pardon me if I don’t care at all that someone broke a couple of their windows and turned a few of their trash cans upside down.

Where did you read in his comment that damaging the buildings was justified?

destroying state property when the state is in the midst of violently oppressing an organic uprising is actually good and justified, you fucking spineless sycophant bootlicker

Can you elaborate on this? I'm sure I'm familiar with the person but what's the incident?

1/ [Nice Lie buddy](https://imgur.com/gallery/DlHk9fQ) 2/Have you even walked down Broad street in the past month? Every single business is boarded up because of these rioters. No business are going to want to come here. Nobody is going to want to live here in its current state. You are being very naive if you think this is the right way to go about marching for the cause 3/ So you admit on May 30th that the protests were violent but then your against order trying to be restored on the very next day? I’m done arguing with you anarchists. You guys have absolutely no idea how the world works and your moral compass is tremendously corrupted.

It’s very obviously implied in the (on buildings that are certainly insured.) The fact that they’re insured is irrelevant when the act of destroying it is wrong. Bringing up that it’s probably insured is a very flimsy attempt at some sort of justification.

Name-calling isn't going to change anybody's mind.

You have such a backwards view of the world that has been molded by all of the media you consume. If you actually think this is an organic uprising that the people started themselves you are truly mistaken. The leaders of all these organizations such as BLM and Antifa are admitted Marxists. And if you don’t know what Marxists do, their goal is to upend the current societal structure through the use of useful idiots (I.e these rioters.) once they’ve accomplished their goal they dispose of these useful idiots. You are very obviously being controlled. Police are not actively hunting black people. If you actually ask those who live in the inner city neighborhoods, they will tell you they need more police. Stop acting like you have their best interests in hand when in fact this movement will have the opposite effect.

That manchild assaulted me on multiple occasions for taking down some of his fascist propaganda and for being gay and Jewish. He only left me alone because I threatened to show his friends a pic of him at Fallout doing some stuff they would be seriously pissed if they knew about. Several of my joints didn't click/pop until after I met him. Additionally, he brought a fucking halberd to the UTR rally in Charlottesville. Police did fuck-all, and I am 90% sure he's not even banned from campus, but his classes challenged him so he no longer goes here.

> Nice Lie buddy ...wow, you sure showed them by pointing out literally one counterexample, even though you know that's not what they meant by "fighting in the streets." And maybe instead of blaming the protesters, blame the fucking police for killing Black people and brutalizing peaceful protesters! None of this shit would have happened if police listened to the early protests and actually behaved like civilized humans instead of violent goons. > So you admit on May 30th that the protests were violent *but then your against order trying to be restored on the very next day?* They literally never said anything even approximating that idea; you put those words in their mouth so that you could call them an anarchist and ignore the rest of their comment.

an American right-winger accusing an anarchist of being morally adrift might be the most ironic thing i've seen today, given that your own moral compass seems to always point to "side with the violent instruments of white supremacy" with the subtext "uncritically repeat Trump's assertion that rioters are evil anarchists" and the person who you are criticizing is actually working to undo the systems your particular brand of hateful, ignorant apathy has built and perpetuated i've studied enough history to know that in thirty, forty, fifty years people will look back at people like you exactly the same way we look at the arch-segregationists of the Jim Crow era: as backwards, criminally stupid, mean-spirited freaks who were rightfully crushed by a popular movement they could never hope to understand

Christ you’re like an off brand Ben Shapiro. I’ll humor your reply one time for the benefit of anyone who might believe your bs. 1. One random fistfight in a city 200,000+ people does not equate to “people fighting in the streets.” 2. The windows a boarded but the business are all still open aside from a few that were looted on the 30th. 3. No one is against order coming back to the city, you idiot. People are upset that unmarked police vans were snatching people off the streets and holding them for 12+ hours without even charging them on the 31st. 4. Just to hammer my point home that Richmond isn’t “going to shit” and that you’re an idiot who has no idea what he’s talking about, here’s an article from the local news: [Police say Richmond riots were instigated by White Supremacists disguised as BLM](https://www.wsls.com/news/virginia/2020/07/27/police-richmond-riots-instigated-by-white-supremacists-disguised-as-black-lives-matter/) . The only violence in the city (not including the rampant police brutality), was in May when the entire country was rioting and last weekend when white supremacists came to the city to insist hate. That ls far from the picture you’re trying to paint. I hope you see a doctor for all the shoe polish you’ve ingested.

Rioters........... my man you haven’t seen a riot. The reality is that if the BLM protesters wanted to get violent, they would mess more than a couple of windows and set a fire to dumpsters. Nobody who’s protesting that (with good intentions) want to do shit that way. We would be no better than the likes of you and the fools who are on the opposite side of this issue. If a few acts of vandalism gets your underwear knotted up but not the issues BLM protests for? Yikes. Might have to take a hard look in the mirror.

He brought up the buildings being insured because of the damages that Rao stated. Meaning that even tho the damages may be in excess of $100K, the university won’t worry about having to pay a bunch of money for repairs.

I don't want to change this person's mind, I want him to understand he's a valueless worm with neither the interest nor capacity to make any assertions about our current political moment

lmao, this entire post is subliterate nonsense from someone who doesn't understand Marxism, but just FYI - I am a Marxist, and I have a master's degree in history from VCU, and you are a contemptible cretin who hasn't the faintest idea what the historical or philosophical characteristics of any ideology are, much less the sophisticated nuances of dialectical materialism and it's political manifestations. just because you've been utterly cowed by decades of fox news and your half-concussed troglodyte uncles who convinced you, one ruined thanksgiving at a time, that the evil communists are coming to take your right to say the n word, doesn't mean everyone is as smooth brained as you. i could go on, but i'm sure your hyperconfident 19 year old white dude business major self will have some artfully crafted rebuttal pulled wholesale from a breitbart writer who thinks the VA is socialist and communism is when the government does things (bad things), so really: ultimately all that really matters here is that people like you aren't wanted at VCU or in Richmond. you're a mean-spirited racist dullard with roughly the same level of sociopolitical sophistication and education as a middle schooler who was bonked on the head with a big cartoon mallet labeled "uncritical acceptance of truisms" which has led you to make the most generic and philosophically incurious assertions about political movements you don't understand and instinctively dislike, because doltish, reductive conservatism is generally a personality trait characteristic of totally irredeemable reprobates, such as yourself. when you get to VCU, if you express your shitty, childish views, you will be rightly mocked. nobody will want to be your friend, because you don't deserve friends or friendliness. please do not come to our city or school. you're on the wrong side of history but I wouldn't expect you to actually explore the world of political science or take some courses from the esteemed professors at VCU, who might be able to help you to expand your childish understanding of Marxist/Liberal/Conservative philosophy at least enough that you don't just blunder into conversations shouting "RACE MIXING IS COMMUNIST" like your segregationist grandfather

Statistically, black men are more likely to be arrested and killed by the police. And police brutality against black people has been well documented so you can’t deny it. You can say that they’re not being hunted but they’re definitely being targeted. And by the way, most of the movement is peaceful. And even if it’s not so what? People are fed up. Riots are a legitimate form of protest in America. And as for inner city neighborhoods needing police, one could argue that they’re over policed. They don’t need more police, they need better police.

I don’t get what Marxism or any political points have to do with this post. This is a Vcu subreddit and we are discussing the president of our school. I don’t know why you decided it was a perfect place to go on your tirade but hopefully you’ll learn to stay on subject during your years in college. I’m gonna assume you’re an ignorant incoming freshman.

dumbest shit that i have read today on god

I've known the guy for a long time and he's always been a troubled person. I found out he turned in to a little Neo Nazi but I didn't realize how active he was.

Seriously, I was worried for my friends at the UTR counterprotest. To call what's going on currently a riot is a disservice to everyone the right wingers have killed for no goddamn reason.

I get it's frustrating when somebody constantly misunderstands your viewpoints, that being said shaming is not healthy for anybody.

9 unarmed black people were killed by police last year. This number has gone down by over 50% since 2015. There have been 17 black people killed as a result of these riots. You defending these riots is despicable. You don’t care about these lives. If you did, you would see the amount of death and violence the riots are bringing and wake tf up. But no, you sit there defending these riots, letting people tell you what to be mad about. All of the reasonable people in America see the destruction of these cities and the local governments allowing it to happen and they will vote accordingly.

Oh I'm not saying that we should give up on people headed down a similar path, I'm just saying that sometimes drastic measures need to be taken when they're a threat to other people. The fascist indocrination pipeline is surprisingly powerful.

I definitely care. And I’m not letting people tell me what to be mad about. You don’t have much faith in people’s ability to think for themselves and it’s sad. It takes away from individual responsibility. I’m not saying that the riots aren’t dangerous or that they’re the best way, just that they’re legitimate. And like I said, the majority of the movement has been peaceful. And from what I understand the violence is being instigated by the police. My main issue with your comment is that you insinuated that people are doing it for no reason because “police are not actively hunting black people”.

Daily reminder our present, Michael Rao, makes $1,020,828 yearly He can buy 1,021 brand new iPhones, or 2.8 iPhones a day. If he were to eat instant noodles every day, for 3 meals a day, he could live off of one years salary for a hair more than 7000 years. He can afford to buy 378 gallons of black printer ink. A liquid more expensive than blood. He can buy 510,414 gallons of gas assuming it's $2 a gallon. This much gas in a Bugatti Chiron (a car he can afford after saving for 3 years) could drive 46,401 miles. That is just 2000 miles short of being able to drive the circumference of the earth twice. What could you do with Rao's salary? 🙃

I could buy 34,027 boxes of reeds for my clarinet, or 170 professional-grade clarinets :/

That also does not include all the stipends he receives for housing, transportation, books, etc.

He’s anything but a present. And it’s crazy how $1M can only get you 1,021 iPhones a year. Kinda shows how expensive iPhones are. With Rao’s salary I’d take it to travel the world and fly a few first class flights. But prolly something immediate I’d do is just apply to grad school in japan and pay all the tuition and housing up front and be set.

With his salary I could purchase approximately 1 million stick bugs

And the starting salary for most VCU employees with masters degrees is in the low 30s, and they pay the incredibly important and hard working service / support staff absolutely nothing because they insist on employing contractors to middleman the labor of others, as VCU never misses an opportunity to engage in blatantly exploitative labor practices

Pay rent for 141 years

1 million frosties.

I could afford to tell these freshmen that their lives, safety, and health are not worth risking to come to campus for 12-19 credits of UNIV courses and general requirements towards a bullshit bachelor’s degree that will be worth even less than it is today when they graduate

I could buy \~141 brand new 16-inch MacBook Pro's with all the most expensive options/add-ons

3,402 nintendo switch consoles. With just one year’s pay, I could use a new nintendo switch every day for nearly a decade before I ran out of money!

DEFUND MICHAEL RAO

I would actually be able to go this year instead of having my student loan rejected two years in a row

I could afford Beyonce's onlyfans

Well you can start but cutting it about 50% for taxes.

I could buy 85 new S-Works SL7 race bikes lol

Okay so I was out on my bike and I was thinking about this comment for a while now. What's the differences between a mid range clarinet and a professional grade one? Obviously one is nicer, but where is the money going?

that many iphones takes up 96803.030559 meters cubed. That is 4 times as big as the Lincoln Memorial Reflecting Pool

Wait, where?

But why though?

anyone downvoting this is a rao shill

Word ☝️☝️☝️

Only time I've agreed with something on reddit

A lot of it is the quality of wood, and the time it takes to make it. Typically student-grade clarinets are plastic, and as soon as you get to real wood the price starts going way up. (by student-grade I mean like middle school student).

Wait, what? 1021 iPhones take up 97k cubic meters? Are you saying a single iPhone is 96 cubic meters? Lol

Didn’t know iPhones took up so much space tbh

stick bug store

Oh someone's insecure

When are we rioting outside the president’s office homie?

Neat! I'm assuming it has a different acoustic property than plastic, right?

Lol because its reuseable? Unless you wanna behead people at the same time or multiple locations, just seems wasteful, but no judgement.

Yeah, bet you want to sodomize it.

After everyone in the dorms gets infected

Oh yeah absolutely! Nice wooden clarinets have what's called a "darker" tone, so they don't sound super bright and tinny. Also since vibrations are a huge part of it, a wooden clarinet can vibrate better than a plastic one.

I think you missed the fact that this whole comment chain was joking lmao

Well they’ve been moved in for a good six hours now

Today I learned! Thanks :D

Transformation of VCU captured by Google street view

It funny that someone else did this. My coworker and I were at work on campus and we decided to see what our city used to look like. VCU sure has come a long way from when I first knew it

Wow I had assumed that art building on Broad in the first slide was historic from the style. I didn’t realize it was new. Really beautiful design.

While VCU does have its issues, I am genuinely grateful for how much they revitalized Richmond and made it a good place to live.

Is this just something that you can do on google maps street view? I'd love to try it.

Wait til you check out Grace Street

Take me back, please. This just makes me miss late 00s Richmond even more than I already do

Just cross-posted to r/rva. Then I went and did the same thing with my house/street in Oregon Hill to see how it’s changed over the years!

It is historic, a former trolley station. The facade dates to the 1970s. [VCU News article on the rehabilitation project.](https://news.vcu.edu/article/Creative_platform)

I was surprised by that as well!

Yes! In the top left corner of each screenshot you’ll see the date the picture was taken. If you click on the date while using Google Maps, it allows you to change the date! Hope that helps.

pepperidge farm remembers

And [this photo gallery from the RTD](https://richmond.com/news/local/history/from-the-archives-65-photos-of-richmond-in-the-1930s/collection_2b03c705-bd27-5e60-a89c-57d3ce1960b5.html#48) has a nice picture of it from 1938. I'm glad they were able to restore the original facade and bring the building back to its former glory, because that 70's stuff was just awful... Note: if you search the gallery for "Glass" it'll take you right to the photo

Guys be careful with cheating on exams.

WOW. I TAed for Reiner years ago and this man does not fuck around. I can’t imagine how pissed he is right now.

Reading this gave me anxiety lol

Way back at the beginning of the semester we got an email like this in a different class I took this semester. Multiple people had straight up copied the same answers from quizlet and submitted them for a quiz and they were lucky that the prof gave a stern warning and the ability to redo the work with no penalty.

Or cheating in general. Back when I was a TA I had to turn in people who plagiarized entire sections of their lab reports, thinking I wouldn't notice. Sometimes I caught lab reports that I had graded the year before being resubmitted. It's never pretty when someone gets kicked out of the university for cheating and burns years and tens of thousands of dollars just cause they couldn't be bothered to do an assignment. BTW careful of helping other people as well. Never give someone access to your work "so they can take a quick look and get an idea where to start" They will plagiarize your work and you will be in trouble yourself. The owner of the lab report I graded twice ended up having his grade retroactively changed to an F for sharing his work with his friend who submitted it with barely any changes.

Coming forward for this would be dumb. Sounds like a scare tactic. I don't like when people cheat and think there should be some punishment, but come on this is the oldest trick in the book. "We've got all the evidence but for some reason you need to confess too" Like I could completely see there being no cheating at all and he just sent this out to try to see if anyone would be stupid enough to fess up.

Really annoying that we had to receive it. Please don't cheat.

Or hear me out, don't fucking cheat on your exams.

It costs nothing to not cheat :/

or don't cheat, jesus christ.

Use a burner email problem solved, i doubt they'll give out card name info so easily. This professor is cold as ice, i mean obviously some people will take the easy way out thats how paying to play works especially with lame classes you don't care about. I doubt anyone would come forward especially if thier cheating they probably dont even check thier email 😂, they probably don't even know who actually did it and is trying to bait them out with the oldest tactic in the book

Some teachers are so bad you haven't learned anything so you have to fend for yourself and grasp at straws at the end of the semester. I agree ,don't cheat, but its been a rough semester with everything being online.

If you just straight copy and paste the answers from these websites you are big dumb and deserve to get caught

Sounds like a lovely professor.

Funny how some teachers get mad for copying from quizlet while other teachers straight up just make/copy their own tests from quizlet lol

I remember when I was a TA, watching people desperately try to surreptitiously read wikipedia articles to try to cheat on their essay tests - I never even bothered doing anything about it, the students who were that behind at that stage never managed to pull it out with such half-assed methods, but it was funny.

not sure why people are downvoting. don’t fuckin cheat you fools. or if you do, at least be smart about it.

Yea fuck that. Tho with cheaters, I honestly don’t care too much, that’s the cheaters’ business. But yea, coming forward would be dumb. I understand that in this deal, you’d get a “lesser punishment” for it, but you’d also be implicating yourself.

Don’t be an idiot and inculcate yourself

*WHAAAAA*? /S

Actually it may result in a lower grade but that's better than getting kicked out of uni

That's exactly what I think he's doing. Just trying to get them to come forward. I wouldn't cheat in the first place but if it were me I'd say fuck it, I'll call your bluff.

He actually is an amazing professor. He genuinely wants people to learn and will help anyone who is struggling. I’d imagine cheating would be extra frustrating to someone who tries to create an open educational environment.

The ones I've known who try and take that route have never successfully made their goal, whether it was to pass the class or maintain their GPA they pretty much screwed themselves by spending more time searching for the answers and then running out of time for the test. Technology has given us a million ways to cheat; but it's also given us a million ways to find the wrong answer, and a million ways to get caught.

Prof here: I posted advice on scholarships to a student the other day and people downvoted it. I still have no idea why. It's a stressful time and sadly some people are coping by knocking others down, being hostile, or viewing other's struggles and situational issues as evidence they have some sort of "deficit." Seeing comments on certain posts where people are essentially asking for help and then being dragged through the dirt for asking is beyond me.

That's how he wants it to sound.

You cheat yourself out of your money when you don't learn and just copy answers off the internet. If you're going to spend the money to go to college, get out of the mindset of "I just want the piece of pape Edit: Every time a cheater gets a degree they devalue yours too.

Pandemic or no, people are assholes lol

What subject do you teach

To be honest, I hate cheaters too, but you're not cheating yourself out of anything. Once you get out in the adult world you use very minimal of what you learn in even your most major specific classes in college. Getting the paper is the most important part. Don't cheat though people, that devalues the hard work the rest of us put in.

But they won't find anything if you use a burner email and VPN.

New Wingstop on Broad and Shafer Please be on the dining plan next year 🙏🙏🙏

Hopefully it's there for a while. That space has not been kind to restaurants over the years.

Not affiliated with the VCU dining plan, sorry. But enjoy the wings nonetheless.

Boutta be a whole lot more chicken wing bones on the sidewalk now.

They're FINALLY doing something with that building. It's been a dead zone for YEARS. I think Extreme Pizza closed pre COVID and it just sat there.

Never thought I’d see it. I remember taking my daughter to Extreme Pizza right before it closed and she was about to start Pre-K. She’s now finishing up 6th grade. I don’t particularly care for Wingstop but I’m just glad to see something in that spot.

Oh wow is that where the Extreme Pizza was? That place was expensive AF.

Woah that guy on the corner looks super chill.

I’m happy to see a restaurant there, but Wing Stop is trash.

Please dont be hella expensive

Cocky Rooster is better btw

I saw this building being renovated a while back, glad to see a Wing Stop being built here at VCU. I can’t wait to go there.

Low key hate wingstop

I hope they’re good like the one in White Oaks

That dude straight up chillin in front of the wing stop

Does anyone know when it opens?

My memory may be failing me but I only remember Extreme Pizza being there and that had a good run while being pretty consistently busy, been empty since. Are you thinking of somewhere else?

I think wingstop is one of those places that’ll be popular enough to stick around. Campus needs more bone in chicken places tbh

I was sophomore at vcu when someone drove their car into that extreme pizza and then it closed forever

One could only hope it’ll be one day… a discount would be cool too tho-

The rats of Monroe are gonna have a field day

I’m praying they do student discounts at least 😭

I’d love to know that. They made quick work on the inside so I’d assume soon

Yeah I remember Xtreme Pizza there all the way back to at least 2009/2010

The pizza was not extreme at all lol

I might be, whoops.

lol, yeah what was there before Extreme Pizza?

Not with Wingstop prices, they’re absurd

Wow, I never knew that.

I feel like the discount would be the same as coldstone being like %10 off

It burnt to the ground during construction but extreme rose from the ashes like a phoenix

Virginia Commonwealth University students walk out of graduation

It’s crazy how so many people who weren’t even there are super mad and saying we’re not getting our diplomas. Everyone who was there cheered for the ppl walking out, no one was actually mad there tbh. Maybe a few but overall it was fine

I thought it was bad when they had fucking Jim Webb talk at my graduation, but no they managed to fuck it up even more. Never change VCU

Good for them.

Makes me proud to attend for the fall semester

Did we ever solve the question of whether he said “President Rao” or “President Ryan?”

Reddit is owned by the usual suspects. No wonder so much muslim hatred here. Same way quora is also Hinduthva owned.

Why don’t they make an actual difference and fight for hamas 😂

I graduated VCU this semester. At my department ceremony there were some people that wore some free Palestine stuff and they walked the stage and that was that. It was respectful and honestly, I feel, had a more positive impact and provided a greater effect than walking out. I think that it is a little extreme to walk out on the governor while they were giving a speech. Personally, I think people need to respect that a person was elected by people in this country and there is a reason why they were elected. You might not agree with the election but walking out disrespects more than just the person who is speaking. Yes, I would sit through a speech given by either Joe Biden and Donald Trump even though I think they both suck. Respect the position, not the person. Additionally, I am happy that the only thing that happened was they walked out. Considering how much people were worried about what was going to happen, I think says a lot about today’s day and age and that’s sad.

Sigmas, all of them.

I am a student, although not a graduating one, and I thought it was really brave of y’all. Unfortunately, I’m immunocompromised so I haven’t been able to participate in any of the protests. But I felt so much pride seeing my fellow students stand up for injustice and anger watching them getting attacked by the police for exercising their first amendment right. I read an article recently noting that the Palestinians are aware of US students protesting on their behalf and it means a lot to them. I’ll try to find it. So just know that you are doing the right thing and have the support of a lot of people, even if you can’t always see it ❤️

Wish we could have had the governor at our UVA graduation!

Nothing more American than our right to protest 🇺🇸

Nothing more American than our right to protest 🇺🇸

Why do you think showing “respect” to an elected official is more important than students standing up for their morals? It’s not like they started interrupting him or doing any other kind of demonstration they just left? What’s wrong with ur priorities here bro?

Extreme? Youngkin is a clown. Good for the students who walked out.

Youngkin is the clown lol

They’re not saying you don’t have the right to. But exercising it when the governor is congratulating the students and offering words of wisdom is inappropriate. Go yell at the capitol - seems to be more appropriate

Screw Youngkin. He disrespected students all over the state with his bullshit rhetoric about the protests. Walking out is the LEAST disrespectful thing that has happened here. They should have boo'd him into oblivion and drowned out his hate.

Protesting kids being blown to bits with our tax money and diplomatic support is more important than being “appropriate” to some governor.

where he’s actively trying to destroy our university and eliminate CRT? nah, fuck him for his own work too

Very emotional response. His commencement address wasn’t hateful at all. You may disagree with previous statements and his political views and that’s fine, but be respectful. If you want to protest, go protest where it actually helps. VCU has no pull

So then go protest where it matters. It’s not at a graduation event but maybe where legislation is passed. It’s not like you live in Cali, you’re within 2 hours from the capital.

Eliminating CRT is destroying your university?

So, I should respect someone that does not show respect? Nah. Youngkin just follows the MAGA playbook and unfit to actually lead. He threw a hissy fit when he didn't get his stadiums and started attacking anything that doesn't follow that agenda. CRT/Book bans/Backed renaming schools TO Confederate generals/attempting to dismantle marijuana and THC laws/dismantled the state's DEI/Allowing the Sisters of the Confederate to continue to be tax exempt.... So, emotional???? Maybe... Deserving.... 100%

it’s one of many things that were addressed above. as an anth major, not addressing anthropologies past and teaching how to avoid it would make shit anthropologists. anthropology and crt go hand-in-hand, as crt addresses racial and societal influences in each other, and the impact of those influences.

Not my university, but yes. While Conservatives rant and rave about removing statues from Monument Ave because it is "removing history" and then banning the teaching of history is complete hypocrisy. Anyone in support of banning CRT is a racist. And you won't change my mind.

Do your part to fight COVID-19 **REPORT PARTIES IN DORMS TO vcudean@vcu.edu** If you want to stay in your dorms and stop the spread, **you** need to be proactive in reporting this dumb shit. You don't see people wearing masks where they should, report it. Tell your friends not to go to parties. While snitches might get stitches, they don't get lung damage and they get to stay in their dorms. Please don't stand back and watch it happen when you can do something. VCU can only stop activities like this if you speak up. * WEAR YOUR FUCKING MASKS * DOWNLOAD THE COVIDWISE APP [Apple](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1518059690) [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=gov.vdh.exposurenotification) * WASH YOUR HANDS * FOLLOW THE RULES

Also, when you wear your mask, please make sure it covers your NOSE. Your nose is connected to your lungs just as much as your mouth is! If you don't cover your nose you might as well not be wearing a mask at all :/

Lmao these next few weeks are going to be a shit show. I’ve been back for two days and I’m pretty sure I already have it because my roommates decided to go out the day before I came down and now one of them is running a fever. Even if you do all you can too avoid it there are too many people on campus that don’t care.

Please upvote this into oblivion.

The COVID parties and potlucks already are insane. Way to ruin it for everyone.

This app is great !! If we all used this we would flatten the curve - please share !!!

Are computer labs going to be open? As an engineering student with a shitty laptop it is my lifeblood

I'm gonna slap the next person I see wearing a mask on only one ear, leaving their entire fucking face exposed. Then I will sanitize.

I think first names and floor number/room number would be enough to alert staff! <:O

Report that shit. I'm positive they can figure out who it was by looking at the building and floor. Ultimately they're going to keep doing it and when they cause an outbreak they're going to ruin it for everyone :/

Anyone who went to one of those is a fucking idiot. The students who hosted them disserve to be suspended. It's extremely irresponsible and negligent behavior on their part.

I'll be real with you, I don't know

Engineering labs I believe will be open for labs, really doubt most shared computer spaces will be available, but I’m pretty sure the university does loaner computers? Don’t quote me on that

a lot of schools (at least gdes) are having time slots of labs, that have stations spread out more. my major has already gotten an email about how to sign up for them so it might be worth asking a program head/emailing in about getting lab time and your circumstances.

You should uhhhh **report that shit** because it's going to be their fault when everyone gets kicked out of the dorms with only 80% refunds

Hell yeah good shit

Yeah of course! I'd doubt they would share who emailed with anyone but you could also use a fresh Gmail account to send the email

Experience walking your animals on/ around campus? Hey, I am quite curious about others experiences walking their animals on campus. Ive been attempting to walk my animals on campus, bit by bit. Ive been usually just walking him in between the Singleton and James music buildings and letting him get a feel for the outside. Friday, I was just letting him explore a bit and heard some students say that "Oh, that cat is too skinny." "He looks like he doesnt eat at all." Do others have the same negative experience as me, or is it both positive and negative? Im just really curious is all.

I think one thing to consider is that most people’s cats are overweight. I’m don’t mean the 22lbs cats but a pound or two overweight. So when people see a cat at an actually healthy weight, they are thrown out of sorts and think the cat is skinny. Most people aren’t aware their cat or cats they know are overweight or they rationalize it by saying it’s only a pound or two. But when you are only supposed to weigh 7-12 pounds (this is generalization of cat weights) a pound over weight is a significant percentage of your body. I wouldn’t put too much concern to other people’s comments about your cat’s weight. If your vet says they are healthy, that is all the matters. Don’t worry so much about what other strangers think.

Mostly positive but there will always be some weirdos can’t be helped. I just try not to engage them.

Looks can be deceiving friend. My dog chooses not to eat until he wants to and people get worried they’re babysitting him. A shitzu has the same bite force as the 6inch tires on my skateboard, 150psi just for an example. Heck I don’t even say his full breed because it can be intimidating even though he’s thinks the world is all his friend so I get your concern Don’t worry about them, keep being an awesome cat parent because those random people don’t know anything about you or your cat. You obviously care enough to get them some exercise and stimulation in a really safe way and with that I can very highly assume you’re taking care of their food and basic needs (don’t make an ass of us both). Judgement sucks but the only judgement that matters in this situation imo is what the cat thinks of you and i get the feeling thats nothing but love, admiration and thankfulness that your their best friend

hey! if it helps, i'm a vet assistant and a cat owner myself and i think your kitty looks a perfect weight! most cats are at least a pound or two overweight (one of mine included...), people generally think cats at a healthy weight look skinny.

I am tempted to buy a birdy backpack and bring one my feathered family members to school!

Both of these answers are perfect! I wouldn’t care what those other people say! Your cat is still young! It looks healthy & happy!

From me you'll get waving and saying hi to your pets as I walk past

He’s gorgeous and perfect!

He looks just fine to me, but I don’t have cats so idk. I love seeing people walk their pets on campus, and also if they have those things on the lease that let you know if it’s okay to come say hi or not

This is my first time seeing a cat on a leash

I have many cats. Took one to the vet thinking he was sick because he was skinny. Perfectly healthy and they told me “your other cats are probably just fat”

First off: absolutely do not trust the opinions of students, they’re still learning. You might even encounter people that have never even seen a cat on a leash. In general, people at a university are often coming from places of great parental sheltering. Personally? I walked my dog a couple of times around campus and got totally mixed reactions. None that ever really stuck out or that I thought to internalize. It sucks they thought your cat was skinny enough to say something, they look fine and healthy to me.

Absolutely cute red tabby cat! He looks happy and healthy! How old is he?

Hi!! Oh my goodness your cat is adorable! I think I saw you the other day with my roommate as we were walking by. We pointed and looked and both love it when people walk their cats around.. admittedly we were too shy to say hello, however haha! I think it really shows that you love and care for this cat if you bring the little guy out for walks. like others have been saying, looks can be deceiving. younger cats tend to be thinner anyway, so who are strangers to judge how healthy your cat is if they don’t know the age? i have cats myself and have many years of experience caring for them and this one looks totally healthy!

✋🏻 Edit:nvm op is black

Thanks for the tips! When they were murmuring about my cat i dont think they knew that I could still here them 😭 and it made me more upset. Plus, he is about to be 6 months, so he is between 3-5 pounds rn, which is on track for his age.

He a small lil baby that irritates me half the time😌

He turns 6 months on Saturday!

Thank you! Also please feel free to come say hi whenever you see me😂 he is a bit shy, but likes people. And I mostly walk him between Singleton and James music buildings, sometimes in the middle of Shafer and the library as well.

Aww he’s just a middle school kid still growing into his paws! People need to mind their own business, that cat looks healthy and happy

He is an absolutely gorgeous orange king!

I think maybe you should ask yourself what does their comment affect? Does it suddenly make your cat unhealthy? No. Does your cat’s feelings get hurt? No. Are they saying something that makes you unsafe? Not in this situation. Does it stop you from walking your cat? No. Does anything actually change because of their comment? No. There are lots of rude people in the world and if you let all of their opinions get to you, you are going to have a lot of hurt feelings. I don’t say that to be mean. But you will be a lot happy if you can get to a place where these strangers comments don’t affect you. It’s not always easy especially when people are mean. Yes there will be situations where strangers opinions do affect your ability to accomplish something and you should be aware of that. Maybe next time something like this happens ask yourself what changes in my life/friend’s life/situation/relationship etc. because of their comment? I’m not saying dismiss everything other people say, but the ability to critical think about what others say is important in many aspects of life.

The above comment is right one. Your cat is gorgeous and a super healthy, growing young babe. Be proud of him and ignore the haters!

It's his turn to hold the brain cell.

I just realised that I'm about to graduate from VCU with ZERO student loan debt!!!! Mini Wave in celebration of me!!! Who else is excited for graduation?

That’s major, congrats; use that to your advantage long term

Great work!!

Fuck u…. Take my congratulations 🎉

That is so incredibly exciting and quite the accomplishment! Congrats!!!

How tell us!

OMG SAME YASSSSSS

Did you work and/or get scholarships? Curious because may have a VCU freshman and they were the only school that didn't offer a scholarship.

how were you able to do that? congratss

Mini wave in celebration of you!!!

LOOK AT US GO

Hazmat Incident at VCU

Y'all, no making meth in the dorms

As a former CHEM 101/102 summer lab TA, I have a lot of questions about what was going on here. How do chemicals "fail", and why on earth are they heating them in a microwave of all things?

Ok yall buckle up. I do work with microwaves and how useful they can be in chemistry. A glass beaker would NOT cause the microwave to fail unless it had a lot of metal in it(also wouldn’t warrant Hazmat) How did chemicals “fail”???? What smoke? How was there smoke??? Why is Hazmat there? Nothing that they are reporting is remotely adding up to this amount of a response.

https://preview.redd.it/4dmrw07dcx8f1.jpeg?width=1206&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=44314c4052c5be9cfca9e54bccbb8d565be70c62

FOR THOSE WHO WANNA KNOW WHAT HAPPENED: i was there when hazmat got there. i asked the guy who was in the room, mightve been an instructor. he said they were doing a microwave digestion experiment and the coils from the microwave digestion machine burned up and blew a LOT of smoke, they were worried the chemical fumes might get mixed in with that and make some really nasty toxic stuff, so they called hazmat. they did NOT use a kitchen microwave used for food. this was a specialized tool used for a specific test done on chemicals and it overheated, causing a small fire and smoke

Just walked past. There’s so many emergency vehicles

I couldn’t find that scritchy thing to turn on my Bunsen burner so, voila, microwave.

Did someone break a mercury thermometer?

so what happensss im curious

hmmm... somebody earned that 'F'.

Damn couldn't be trusted with Bunson burners now can't be trusted with a microwave

My ex-wife farted

As a history major who hasn’t taken chemistry since my sophomore year of high school, I have the same questions

I’m an education major and I had the same questions.

And if you are gonna heat them in the microwave, why not use the “Chemical” hot key right next to “Popcorn”? That’s what it is there for.

The "fail" likely comes from the dispatcher trying to figure out a way to describe the situation while probably having only taken the bare minimum in science classes in HS and/or college. Using the microwave to heat the chemistry on the other hand is blowing my mind, outside of a few controlled experiments nothing good can come from using a microwave to heat your chemistry...

i was there when hazmat got there. i asked the guy who was in the room, mightve been an instructor. he said they were doing a microwave digestion experiment and the coils from the microwave digestion machine burned up and blew a LOT of smoke, they were worried the chemical fumes might get mixed in with that and make some really nasty toxic stuff, so they called hazmat

Any word what the chemical was ?

There are special microwaves that are used for chemical reactions, especially in organic synthesis and "click" chemistry. Many research labs have them. They can heat reactions faster than a hot plate or oven. Also, since only polar molecules are affected by the microwave radiation, you can selectively heat heterogeneous systems. However, it's also possible some dummy stuck a beaker of chemicals in the break room microwave.

As a chemical engineer I have the same question. Probably some idiots heating random shit in a microwave. Windex and bleach would have been a Darwin Awads

This should be higher up.

Microwave digestion involves strong acids. If you are heating a strong acid (using a specialized microwave in this case) and you start to see smoke, you are going to kill power to the microwave and evacuate. At that point the appropriate response is Hazmat to make sure the incident is contained before returning to the lab to figure out what happened. Likely a failure in the microwave instrument. As a chemist, I see nothing wrong with this response given the limited details available.q

i posted a full explanation on exactly what happened on here

The hot zone? New bombshells about to enter the villa yall

Yea none of that matters. I'm telling everyone it was a microwave used in the kitchen

I don’t know why but you calling it a scritchy thing is so hilariously accurate that I am cackling

i posted an explanation in here

Microwave waves can actually be very beneficial to certain reactions, one example being williamson ether synthesis!

Well no wonder the chemicals failed!

Makes sense. I'd probably physically throw someone out of the lab if I saw them trying to heat something in a microwave as opposed to on a hot plate or using a Bunsen burner.

its a microwave digestion machine, a machine specifically designed for what they were doing, it tests the chemicals you put in it

Your response makes sense

lmao people need to ask questions rather than assume how things were done

It’s called a scritcher. I googled it.

Yea, I had seen in a later update that this unit was in a hood enclosure when the incident happened which indicated to me this was something more than just a microwave oven. While I have taken several chemistry and physics classes, I guess I never reached the level that would require the use of something like this (or the school I took them at didn't have one, it has been about 18 years since my last chemistry class).

yeah fume hood, i was speaking to the instructor when they were outside waiting for hazmat to finish up. he said everything was very controlled and they were just being extra safe by bringing the hazmat crew

I will be competing in the Collegiate iRacing Series starting on October 6th and will be broadcast live on twitch

Link the twitch homie

Good luck homie.

Pretty new to road racing so I’m still learning and not that great lol. We just had an open practice session and I wasn’t the slowest but I wasn’t close to fastest lol.

You and Dadgamerswiss should have a Black and Gold race

That VCU car design is dope

Nice I have a friend on the racing team, I’ll be sure to tune in

Holy shit theres racing fans here?

Which track y’all running?

I haven’t gotten the link yet but when It gets closer to race day I will make another post on here

The season starts October 6th and are run every other Tuesday at 9 pm EST. Races are 1 hour sessions. 1. Spa 2. Monza 3. Le Mans 4. Road America 5. Imola 6. Daytona

join up if you race too

I wish man, I still haven’t made that leap into PC. I mostly just do Forza series.

Rao yapping some excuses. surely this wraps things up

Imagine getting tear-gassed and having to take a final the next day, then have this mf speak at your graduation. VCU never fails to disappoint me

He deeply appreciated those who peacefully protested, yet he had the police tear gas said peaceful protestors???? make it make sense??

Again, this was an utterly chill environment until state police showed up. Clearly with orders to escalate.

VCU, VA Police and Richmond city police were the attackers at yesterday’s peaceful protest. VCU put my children in danger when they used force. Cameras don’t lie. You’re now embarrassed (as you should be) that the world watched VCU attack peaceful students. VCU stands against freedom of speech and the right to peacefully protest. VCU supports fascist government (Youngkin) and unwarranted police force. The least you can do is release the students you arrested. I’m a VCU Alum and shocked that this is how you treated the students and how you are misrepresenting/spinning your decision.

not dignifying the wax figure's word games with a real response but highlighting my fav part: speedrunning in state riot cops with rifles, within 12 hours of a protest, is entirely unlike police-protestor conflicts happening at other universities actually!

> conflict between police and protesters took place That passive voice. Hoo boy Translation: > We called the cops to forcibly remove everyone because y'all can't behave. Not sorry. Behave and it won't be a thing. Cry to the counselors, but don't do it again. VCU rulez. Peace, Mikey R

“conflict between police and protestors took place” is weird way of saying “cops maced and beat peaceful protestors”

Yes, Mr. Rao, when busloads of Riot Police show up, violence is expected; it didn't just 'TAKE PLACE' - it was a well planned and orchestrated maneuver by those whose authority is backed only by their large donations to your university. It is saddening to realize that money over free speech is really your mantra and in truth Mr. Rao, your letter brings no comfort to all those who were teargassed while peacefully protesting. Should you really care about giving platform to protest, provide a SAFE place for that to happen, then speak to the crowd, ask their opinions and get involved.

How do you call yourself President if you tear gas or use any sort of chemicals….. on your own students? If you called the State Police then yes they’re gonna take matters in their own hands. Whacko

Crazy. I remember at UC Davis 10 years ago the police use pepper spray on the protestors that were protesting by sitting on the ground. They had been asked to leave of course but that was their only “crime”. It’s hard to believe they can justify this sort of escalation.

It's giving "stay off my lawn."

Understood, so I'm glad that Rao is admitting that police were not called in for any violent or disruptive behavior, it was just to enforce this one very specific policy to not have tents there.

This wasn’t violent until PD showed up and Vcu deemed it so. As an alum I’m appalled by their response. They deserve all the lawsuits that should come down on them. Lying about not tear gassing and pepper spraying was degenerate too.

Did no one see what happened at Colombia University?

Alumni standing with you all! Stay strong and don’t let the bully’s with guns wear you down!

What an absolutely pathetic response. Quite literally a complete and utter joke.

in case anyone wants to use those services, they will probably (definitely) snitch on you. don’t fall for it.

If they’re refusing to leave what do yall want the cops to do. They peacefully protested all day, were asked to leave at night (nothing good happens at night & they wanted to give them ample time to start moving out before the 11pm time cut where they no longer legally are allowed to have tents up there) , refused to leave. Why not peacefully protest during the day, wrap it up, & come back the next day & protest again - do this literally every day - & avoid all of this??

Yall are straight up cracked. You break the law/rules, refuse to listen to lawful orders from law enforcement and then cry foul when they use force to enforce the law. Keep playing the victim. See how life treats you.

It may be a little late now, but folks who are graduating really should go to their departmental graduation ceremonies because that's where you'll be individually recognized, get to walk the stage, and receive your fake diploma (the real ones are mailed out in the summer), **AND** Youngkin won't be at those, and Rao rarely ever shows up at them. For those who are reading this and were planning on only going to the University-Wide Commencement, contact your advisor ASAP to see if you can still get into your departmental ceremony.

pepper spray, not tear gas.

do people not know the difference between pepper spray and tear gas?

Says staff asked individuals to leave. If they don't voluntarily leave, the police have to use force.

Nah I emailed him back and told him he's lame.

I mean they broke policy, shouldn’t we expect everyone to hold themselves to the rules and regulations set forth?

Columbia University, Colombia is the South American country.

Let’s be real - cops obviously did charge students to get them to move bc they were refusing. I don’t agree that they should have used such violence. But at the same time, it’s hilarious to me that the videos are showing students trying to literally fight COPS. Like seriously…. How dumb of a decision is that? Getting arrested for protesting a cause that honestly, I guarantee more than half of the students do not know what they are even protesting for.

There’s always one of you, may you learn a lesson on human rights one day

They absolutely were tear gassed last night, there’s video proof of it

I also was there, they sprayed and gassed people

There's video in this thread of both being used.

“Have” is doing some heavy lifting there

No they don’t, lol. Look at how https://www.splcenter.org/20140709/war-west-bundy-ranch-standoff-and-american-radical-right resolved…

That's another discussion having to do with proportionality of response, but my main point is that the statement from Rao seems to undermine the assertion that the police were called in because the students were being violent or disruptive (prior to the police moving in). Yet that is the narrative that many people seem to want us to believe.

Human rights? Wtf are you on about? No human rights were violated.

you might notice that the protest was allowed to continue for hours after the arrests. the free speech wasn’t the problem, it was the trespassing and throwing shit. is it a protected human right to be allowed to throw bottles?

Can I see said videos. I myself was downwind of the pepper spray for sure.

Could you send me the video proof of tear gas? I'm asking in good faith I promise

they are not the same thing.

So what do you recommend then after asking if they will leave and they do not comply?

Nobody was committing ANY crime. It is against VCU policy to set up structures on the lawn, it's not against the law. No crime was committed, VCU used the state police force to enforce a university policy.

up until the police arrived, everything was fine. once they showed up they started making it a violent situation. it didn't go on for hours after the arrests either like... where did you even get that information from?

You’re not wrong, but it seems the escalation was really due to the police doing what police do

I promise you there was... I was at the site and saw the man load the tear gas himself

[Here](https://twitter.com/GoadGatsby/status/1785112806980747488), the tear gas is shown around 1:30 into the video

No, but both were used. Someone linked a video in the comments showing both being used at the same time.

Why do they have to leave a public space? Richmond doesn’t have a curfew. Public streets and parks are for all of us, all the time. Let them be.

Anyone just kinda wanna... give up? I wish they would’ve just been like “oh ya know what in light of the massive fucking global PANDEMIC goin on, maybe we’ll go a little easier on students since I’m sure they have other things to worry about besides completing *hours* of busywork assignments” but no. School has somehow gotten harder. My classes have more work than they would’ve. Online lecture videos are useless to me, not the same as in-person. The price we’re paying for this shit has somehow INCREASED from what we would’ve paid for in-person (or ya know, NORMAL) college. I’m just tired and I’m done. I don’t understand how they can expect underripe adults like us to somehow juggle all of this disorganized, convoluted online shit in the midst of a literal worldwide crisis. I really don’t know what my point was in typing any of this shit out but I guess I’m just venting. This world sucks dick. Someone cancel the simulation bc we fucked up big-time

I am equally discouraged this semester. Most of my classes are kind of a mess, and I completely agree with you about the fact that virtual learning is not the same as the classroom. I hate to say it, but I don't know what else to do besides buckle down, do my best, and hope that things will start to look better. I hope that you are ok and are able to take care of yourself this semester.

One thing I'll say is that, during a pandemic everyone is already way out of their comfort zones and super confused WHY WOULD YOU TRY TO SWITCH TO CANVAS RIGHT NOW?! Im used to canvas, even from the instructor side but my professor doesn't understand how to use it entirely and she is cramming all the week assignments into one module so it's just getting bigger and bigger and messier and it's driving me up a wall!

I graduated some years ago but I’m a Richmond native and inner city resident so I still follow this sub. Really couldn’t believe it when I saw kids moving into the dorms a couple weeks ago. Just mind blowingly stupid that VCU thought any level of in person instruction would be ok. It also confuses me as to why students and/or students’ parents would go along with this shit show. Unless you’re on a scholarship, wouldn’t it make much more sense to save your money for a semester and see how things play out going into the next semester while the university figures its shit out? Anybody who blindly trusted VCU to handle things in an organized, rational fashion hasn’t been at VCU very long.

I think your rant is valid. I am pretty frustrated with VCU, raising tuition when the quality doesn't match bc everything is online. At the end of the day, they are in it for the money and they know students will stay and pay. All we are to them is checks. Just gotta push through. Hopefully next semester it will be better.

I'm sorry, friend. I know a lot of people feel the same way as you do. What's your major? Are there any uplifting or motivating parts for you about school right now?

All my classes are a clusterfuck and I have no idea what’s due and when or if I even have work. Doesn’t help that they also seemed to upped the workload.

I am a student who also teaches. We’re in uncharted territory. Communicate with your professors. Use your resources. Academic advisors, career advisors, financial aid advisors, and university counseling. The professors I know and have worked with want to be flexible. SAEO is also a great resource. This is hard. It’s normal to be frustrated and hit a wall. Persevere. This isn’t forever. Voice your concerns, ask for help, and give yourself grace. You’re living through an historical event. No one knows how to feel or act. Be there for each other. And make the choices that are right for you after consulting the resources available to you. I hope it gets better for you.

The fact im on campus dorming because 1 of my classes did not offer the online option is ridiculous and I want to go home, it’s really not safe.

Lmao underripe adults, I’m stealing that

Also the fact that a fucking microscopic, non-sentient VIRUS has the power to fuck up humanity on this large of a scale before we get the chance to pull our heads out of our asses is just proof that we’re nowhere near as smart as we think we are and is frankly, hilarious

i feel this hard. i'm already in a degree program that i'm kind of disillusioned with making anything out of -- to the point where two weeks in, i still haven't actually *attended* any of my classes -- but i'm RIGHT at the end, so sunken cost fallacy is in full effect. had the semester not been so online, i would've gone ahead and completed it, but i kind of don't think i can be bothered anymore? i'll probably end up dropping my classes by the end of the night

Paying 10k for what amounts to less informative Khan academy videos must be suicide fuel

I'm quite discouraged too, but I know that if I ever let up, I will become homeless.

I hate having to switch b/w different online software. I've got Canvas, Blackboard, Aleks, TopHat, Slate, MatLab, and more stuff I haven't even paid for. I do however, like pre-recorded lectures because I can't keep up with traditional in-person classes. I usually miss a ton of information because the professor switches slides too quickly. But yeah I definitely feel your pain.

You know what else got harder ? This p e n i s. And my hemorrhoids. They’re unbearable

I prefer Canvas and I have to agree. This semester was not the time to switch platforms. I guess their thinking was there’s no point of designing online courses on blackboard if it is going to be phased out.

Just FYI the change to Canvas was scheduled and happening long before the pandemic started.

Did they raise tuition? I wasn’t aware of that

Why didn’t you skip the class this semester and taken it during next or summer?

Ah I see. Yeah I agree training would have been wise. Part of me just wants to take the instructor control away from my professor and just fix it for her 😂. I'm still working on my patience

I'm sure every college raises tuition every year, correct me if i'm wrong though

To stay on track.

I understand, I graduate from chemistry, and pchem was like that. I had to rush through pchem 1 in the summer and pick up pchem 2 in the fall. I was fortunate to have a summer option, but honestly I would’ve graduated a year late rather than risk getting covid. VCU really should’ve gone full online. And done recorded labs with different data sets.

Well, we are then paying the same tuition prices, they still should be lowered because online classes don't match the same quality as in person

I understand your situation but I feel considering this is a potentially deadly disease it would have warranted some leniency, especially since it puts your health at risk. Stay safe out there!

William, you left stuff at Mama J's! Mama J's is looking for this student who left his ID and some other things at the restaurant. If you're William or know William, let em know where his stuff's at!

I have dropped an ID in the past at VCU’s police station on Grace. They got it back to him.

if you’re a vcu student or know a vcu student you can type their full name into the vcu email and email them directly

Isn't he Marco's cousin, the one from Tropoja?

(post copied from their FB page)

Rather than posting an image of this student’s face and first name publicly on the internet, it would be better to turn the ID in to the campus ID card office. The university has the student’s contact information and can reach out a lot quicker than you can by posting on social media that the student may not even see. You could even just call the office and tell them you found the card so they can reach out privately. https://cardservices.vcu.edu/

Poor guy, paid way too much for food

Def don’t post students over here, you can email the card office to even look up their email. 📧

He looks like someone that will be on the news for doing something terrible.

You can head over to Facebook and tell OP that if you'd like. The restaurant made the post.

But it’s your post

You’re OP though…

No they aren’t… this is a post copied from FB… they don’t have the ID…

And again, my point is, your barking up the wrong tree. Go to the source and tell them. Give them a call or whatever. Or if you just want to know someone heard your opinion, here: I hear you. Satisfied? You seem to be the only one with an issue over my sharing a post to 11k people that was already broadcasted to over 75k social media users. It's 2025. It's not that deep.

Okay but I don't have the ID myself, so I can't follow your advice. Your advice would be for the people who are holding the items. Don't come for me with judgment and advice I can't actually use... Go be useful and tell Mama J's who took this pic and posted it on their 75k follower fb page (much larger than this lil subreddit).

They are the original poster of this post…OP ALWAYS refers to the post you are commenting on. Not the attachment

Why don’t YOU go to the source and tell them. You’re the one that cross posted this from social media, not me. It’s not my responsibility. Use your brain. That’s what you’re in college for. I don’t even live in Richmond.

"You can head over to Facebook and tell OP that" Original Poster on facebook. Not hard to decipher

Because you're the one with a problem, not me. Get off this subreddit if it's not for you. While I am a student, I also already have a degree and 20+ yrs as an adult. Go sit down.

There’s obviously no reason to continue this conversation with you if you are going to make assumptions about who anonymous redditors on the internet really are. I posted my opinion as a solution to the situation which is a more efficient means of solving the problem than posting on social media or the internet and posting the student’s first name and photo to thousands of users, potentially violating their privacy. I am not on FB, so I’m not going to create an account to tell this to the business on their page, nor do I have the student’s last name, so I’m not the one to call the card office, which is still the most efficient way of doing this. But it is clearly pointless to continue telling you this, so don’t bother replying to this thread, unless you want to continue insulting an unknown person that no longer gives a damn.

For the non-jerks reading this, the advice to call card services or VCU PD has already been suggested on their Facebook post, more than once. Yay! Go away weirdo. I'm happy you're gonna stop pretending you can and should tell strangers what to do. Your opinion was heard. The info is already on their post so there's no reason for me to repeat it. Go have a day and maybe stay off college subreddits if you're in the habit of insulting college students. Take your own advice & use YOUR brain. 🙃

Just wanted to share, William was SUPER happy for the posts. He came back to Mama J's today and took a pic with this ID and THAT got posted as well. Kids don't care so much about not being seen on social media. They grew up on it. He seemed grateful for the quick and easy return of his ID and other items he had left behind. Seemed everything worked out very efficiently and happily and nobody felt violated in the least.

I swear some of the students here must not be taking enough credit hours per semester to have time for bullshit like this

Edited due to not understanding smokeybond's comment... Yeah, bruh was really bothered over something that had nothing to do with him. Apparently doesn't even go to vcu or live in rva!

VCU student death

!!!! CODY WOODSON IS THE TA FOR MY PROGRAMMING CLASS!! This is so horrifying. He deserved better.

Absolutely horrible and tragic. We lost a fellow Ram today and my heart goes out to his friends and family.

Cody seemed to be an incredibly bright, kind young man with his entire life ahead of him and this is an absolute tragedy. I hate the fact that he came to Richmond for opportunity and to live his dreams out and this is how we respond. So many of our VCU students are from outside the city and they come here for the chance to experience at least moderately sized big city living and have to face crap they shouldn't. VCU students feeling safe needs to be a top priority and I don't really think it has been over the years, and that's an indictment on city leadership.

RIP Cody. I didnt know you very well, but we had a few classes together over the years, and I considered you a friend. You were one of the few people I actively chose to sit next to, to talk to, to interact with, and you brought joy to everyone you were around. This whole thing has made me very sad, and I can only imagine what his close friends and family feel like. To them, I'm so sorry for your loss, and for the short time I knew him, he was a great friend and a great person. You deserved so much better, Cody. Rest in peace.

Cody was my roommate freshman year, we lived at cabaniss hall together and he was one of the most hard working and dedicated students ive ever met.

In addition to his family, whoever Cody's girlfriend is, I'm extremely sorry for her loss

Omg I'm sending prayer rn, but I'm afraid now I have a night class once a week, I never had to use ram bus. But I'm scared if I should I hope they can give more details if the killer was a stranger or knew each other previously. I read an email that the victim was running away from the killer and neighbors called police after hearing multiple shoots. I'm sending my prayer 🙏 so cruel and heartless.

Very scary stuff

Horrible so sad

For all of the folks worried about fear-mongering, it’s okay to be realistic, Richmond at the moment is not as safe as it was a few years ago. In the last year, crime has surged a ton around VCU - its people seeking opportunities out of accelerating wealth disparities. The pandemic has brought forth a lot of bad things, and an increase in crime is one of them. And rather than police reforming and listening to the needs of the city, they’ve just become a slightly less aggressive version of the status quo. Blame guns, unemployment, politics, a false sense of security, or whatever you want to blame. But at the end of the day, taking a life of another for anything other than self-defense is inexcusable, no matter the cause. People should be angry and look at this for exactly what it is, a travesty. I can only hope that something is done soon to bring back a little more peace and positivity to the area.

Hope they catch the guy. Richmond pd don’t seem to be too interested in catching these guys though. I got robbed one night by the race track. Had 4 guns to my head. Gave them the plate info for the car they were driving and didn’t catch them. The following night the same group of people robbed a bunch of student on campus and shot one in the leg. They ditched the jeep they were driving and fled on foot. They eventually caught the guy that stole the jeep but wouldn’t show any of the Robbery victims a picture so they could add the armed robbery charges. I was the 5th one they hit that night. Cops didn’t seem to want to do anything and their “suspects” turned up nothing

This is sad to know fellow students are getting killed. I know most people might disagree, but VCU/Richmond is dangerous.

I’m really scared to go to the Kroger that is nearby now

That was my brother. Now that I got older I’ve decided to look into it and see what happened. My life feels so empty without him. He was the only brother who understood me and listened😕

So sad. This is the exact reason why everyone should be armed. Especially in the city.

He TAs for at least 3 sections this semester to my knowledge. Lives right next to the street where it happened, ran to the store to grab some tea apparently. He was my duo in league and helped me through a lot of tough situations.

what theFUCK

Wait which class?

Same for me i’m so fking shocked :( I had him last semester

THAT Cody woodson? No fucking way.

Read that as cannabis at first

Not to scare you, but I highly doubt it was someone he knew. There's a new email also saying "he was shot for no apparent reason." I don't see why someone he knew would kill a good kid like that. It's not rare in cities for a total stranger to come up and mess with you

It never hurts to use the RamSafe if you’re traveling far late at night. I have to use it regularly, and the only thing to remember is that after you get picked up, you might not necessarily be dropped off immediately—you may have to wait a moment while they go to other stops and drop off or pick up students. That isn’t an issue, of course, just something to remember so you don’t get all mixed up if it doesn’t immediately go to your stop.

How would police reform have an impact on this type of crime?

I don’t have the stats on hand, but RPD is very effective at solving homicide cases.

Please don't use this tragedy as an opportunity to fearmonger, this death is tragic and extremely sad. Richmond's crime numbers are lower if not the same as most cities of similar size. Use this as a chance to educate people instead of scaring them.

It’s really not as dangerous as other cities, particularly with how gentrified VCU has made it. I thought Richmond was unsafe and then I moved to a slightly bigger city and it definitely is not as long as you use basic street smarts. This is really sad news though.

Yeah whenever someone says Richmond is dangerous they get downvoted so hard. People don’t wanna acknowledge it but Richmond isn’t that safe.

Damn this makes me nervous about walking around the city now

I know it’s a scary event but you’re overreacting. That’s one of the most highly trafficked areas in the city. You’re not getting shot at the Lombardy Kroger.

i’m really sorry for your loss

Don’t build agreement on the back of bereavement. This isn’t the time to peddle a platform on the basis that subscribing to it could change the outcome of a shooting — that presently, seems completely random.

If the young man that passed away on Monday had a gun on his person at the time, the only thing that would have changed is that he would have died with a gun on him. Think about it, the first homicide, the group the individual who died was with, had guns, and he’s STILL dead. They even shot back. How can you be so fucking stupid.

I have no idea why you got down voted, but definitely will be training and getting a gun. My dad told me a story where he is walking his dog in his neighborhood of 14 years, and all of sudden a car stopped in front of him and about 4 men came out and fortunately he was just mugged but my dad literally had nothing (as he was just walking his dog), one of the guys felt bad and said let's just go guys, he's my lil brother age. My dad couldnt even called police as he had no phone back then and it would MINIMUM take 8-10 min for police to come,, my dad realized his life is in his own hands and he should not have to wait for police to protect his own life. There are horrible people out there that are willing to take your life, you carrying a gun and knowing when/when not to use it is so much better than relying when or if the police come when you need them.

The statistics really do not back you up on that one

Then don’t.

if u think rva is dangerous ur definitely from some super safe nova suburb

Sorry to hear this. Hope you're doing better.

I'm thinking he was being robbed and he didn't comply but I have no idea, the guy is a psycho and a coward. I'm honestly so sad rn he must have been scared, and his poor family it must have such a unexpected and cruel hit to their hearts.

If once a week my lab gets out at 850pm, from harris to bnb dorm is that considered safe to walk without ramsafe? I once tried to use it some semester ago and it told me 1hr wait time so I canceled it.

Considering the police immediately pinned it on drugs when the young black male was killed the day before not 20 feet from Cody, and didn’t think it necessary to patrol at least the day after. I think they could use some reform.

Website I made that gives a visualization of VCU data from dashboard.

The fact that you made a nicer website than vcu says a lot. Good fucking job man.

Feel free to roast my code or give suggestions. Been hesitant to release to this out as it's still a ongoing project.

This is the content I love to see.

Great! The employee cases had a disclaimer because one employee was counted twice. So it never truly went up to 13 — yet.

Do you have a link to the source code? I’d love to see how you did this! (CS beginner)

I like your CSS a lot! From a CS major and someone who appreciates good code, great job!!!!!!!! It’s amazing. I have it saved so I can check it cause it’s way better than the VCU page!

I also made my own dashboard (with a very similar tech stack)! Out of courtesy I won't hijack your post with the link, but I'll PM it to you if you want. I also found the official "dashboard" extremely lacking because it provides zero context to how the case numbers have grown over time.

Nice job. (Knowledge of your site leaked onto the VCU parents Facebook groups, of which I am a member. )

/u/quinn50 If you are one of the students I advise...super proud!

Hi! Thanks for doing this. I've been using your visualization all last semester (it's awesome!). VCU has updated their dashboard and made a separate fall and spring one, so yours doesn't load anymore, I just wanted to lyk.

Yeah this is way easier to understand!

maybe add the explanation of what isolation vs quarantine is that vcu's dashboard has

idk ab codes but that looks nice!!!!

I noticed you are not taking into account that no data was reported on 8/22, and 8/29-30 so your graphs look like the numbers are rising faster since the X axis is off.

thanks, I will change that

There is a github link on the site! https://github.com/stearnsbq/VCUCovid-website

I mean, I put it on here. I might have to move it to the cloud as it's currently running on my home server.

Yea, I know with everything online during the fall it felt like taking 20 credits haha when I was only taking 15. I didn't have time to work on it tbh. I archive the html for each day but I didn't do the whole site just the section with the info I need, and they updated the site a while ago that changed some things so I am missing a ton of data. I can see if I can fix it up for the spring and also try to see if I can find some of the missing data

And perhaps use a stacked area graph for that to show total of both?

Omg good luck this next semester! Make time for yourself dude

It's not GTA, stop driving like it I don't know if the driver who killed a student was from VCU, but even if they weren't, y'all actually need to chill the fuck out driving. Not trying to be *that guy* but lately a ton of people driving around campus have been going way too fast and even in the wrong directions. Almost got hit by a car TODAY because they were speeding through an alley and almost didn't see me in time, and almost got my car clocked in a parking garage because people were speeding in the actual garage. We all have places to be, but seriously, slow the hell down. Better to be late than on the phone with your insurance or talking to the police. Be careful out there

We need to start calling out people who are texting and driving. Almost every single fucking person driving on campus is usually on their phone fucking around. Please, stop.

100% agree and being aware of your surroundings goes both ways for drivers AND pedestrians

Shoutout to last year when I nearly got hip checked by a car cuz they couldn’t wait 2 seconds for me to cross the street

I saw someone literally swerving their car all around Cary street in broad daylight like it was nothing

I agree, myself having been in an accident in the Cary St parking deck because someone was speeding and on their phone.

I recently moved to richmond this month and one thing that always confused me was some of the traffic patterns and the pedestrian traffic lights in the city. Not sure how it works in the monroe campus, but at the MCV campus we have a crosswalk behind VCU hospital on marshall street, near Hunton's student center and VCU medical school. It takes such a long time for the pedestrian light to allow us to walk and the moment you even take a few steps on the street its counting down and the light is red before you cross 60% of the road. My classes are down that same street in Kontos and the Egyptian building. We have a second crosswalk there and there is even a sign that says traffic must yield to pedestrians. Every week I am crossing there I have to stop midway because I see a car that is clearly not going to stop for me and hit me if I keep walking. Most students and health workers have to pretty much jaywalk and there are so many times where my friends and I have to use that "mom hand" to make sure we don't get hit by a car that doesn't wait or is driving too fast. My roommate and I agreed to hold each other's hands like kindergartners crossing the street now. VCU gateway is literally a disaster waiting to happen. I'm afraid an mcv student or a professor will be running too late to an exam or lab and get hit by a car. Left turn yield on red. I am from chesterfield county. In that area, if you are making a left turn and the light is green for the left lane, every other traffic stops and the only ones that are moving are the people making a left turn. It takes longer to make a left turn in chesterfield but at least it is safer. In richmond, you could have a green light to turn left but you have to yield to opposing traffic, and the lane you are turning on, pedestrians may have the signal to cross the road. So not only you have to not get t-boned at the intersection, you have to make sure you don't hit a student crossing the road as well. I don't think every area in downtown has this, but its something I been running into later and I don't think its safe. Last night I was driving home from an event and I passed the area where the girl was hit. There was a crosswalk guard there. Did they wait until a student passed away before they put a crosswalk guard in a section where so many students cross the street to get to class or was that always there. There needs to always be a person there helping with traffic in certain areas around VCU. Its rush time, students are going class while workers are going to work so everyone is rushing and someone may not attention and get hurt or hurt someone. And to the person who hit that student. What The Hell?! How fast was this person going that she had to die?! Everyone needs to stop speeding. Maybe if that driver was driving slower that girl would have been injured, but still alive and recover. Its so depressing, she was a psychology major and was in her final year of undergrad. You guys please stay safe, drive carefully, and look both ways.

Leaving the gym yesterday and I saw someone turn on to Cary in the opposite direction of traffic. Stop, reverse, then go the other way.

My grandma use to say "it's better to lose a minute of your life, rather than to lose your life in a minute." Slow down people.

honestly they should just close the road to traffic on some of the streets on campus. As a driver there is no reason somebody has to he on Main between Cherry and Harrison, or on Floyd between Harrison & Laurel

Vcu police don't do shit about it so it's just going to continue.. it's the same with the crime. We've lost students going home to people who aren't even from the central vcu area. They come just to get into shit.

Op just ended reckless driving with a single post.

THIS THIS THIS I constantly see vcu students texting while driving

license plate name and shame

my freshman year i was crossing the street (with the light mind you) and a guy that wanted to turn right honked at me and yelled “damn you’re taking your sweet ass time huh?” as soon as i stepped off the sidewalk like bro I HAVE THE RIGHT OF WAY!! I WILL WALK EVEN SLOWER!!

You were crossing legally at a crosswalk with the signal in your favor, right? Right?

If I recall correctly, I think we can contact VDOT and they'll send someone out to assess whether the pedestrian walk timer is too fast

Except for delivery drivers and anyone who lives in Oregon Hill....

That’s insane. I don’t get why so many Richmond drivers can’t comprehend the idea of waiting

Honestly forgot I posted this here haha. But yeah, I had the light. Didn’t even begin crossing the street until I had the light

Regardless, if they did or didn't. It's not worth losing your life over someone cross the street

Yeah im gonna have to do that for where I go to class at least. We used to try and wait at the beginning of the semester but everyone gave up and started jaywalking because you have to wait like 3-4 mintues to cross and you don't even get 10 seconds

cumberland is literally right there. you don’t have to use that stretch of main street.

agreed. i still live on campus and the intersection by my dorm is one of the busier ones. every single day i have people basically almost hit me bc they’re trying to turn while people have the walking light.

It's not regardless, I see just as many stupid pedestrians around campus as I do stupid drivers. Just the other day I watched a girl step into traffic against the pedestrian signal, with head down looking at phone, headphones on, almost got creamed, and she never even looked up

And is also a busy St. Your suggestion is just asking for gridlock

Scooters in their natural habitat

That one has been there for at least three weeks, probably a lot longer

Better there than polluting the river

I'll take this over them hogging the sidewalk and blocking disabled pedestrians

Those scooters are super heavy, how does one even achieve this????

I genuinely don’t understand the random scooters all over campus. Do they not have a home? Are they not rented?

I saw that the other day. Impressive that there's one of each.

Yessss! At least these are out of the travel path. I see them in all the most annoying places: in front of a door at VCU, blocking heavily traveled sidewalks, etc.

They’re all owned by a company—you have to pay to use them, it costs per minute.

They're dockless scooters. The way they work is you find one, use an app to rent and unlock it, and then leave it when you're done. They won't work unless you pay.

How do they charge?? Like solar power?

I'm not positive, but I think the companies can usually monitor the status of the scooters remotely and pay people to go around town charging the ones that need it. I have no idea how long the charges last for or how diligent the companies are, though. I think they're also supposed to collect them if they wind up abandoned outside of a certain radius, but there's been a random Lime scooter abandoned on the side of Huguenot Road for weeks now.

...is that a threat?

Look out your window 👀

vcu really pushing its limits w this one lmao

Sucks for the freshmen. For me, orientation was really fun and I’d hate to have it virtualized

There has to be a possible class action lawsuit somewhere in this...

Lol this is funny

Micheal Rao has to get his paycheck somehow.

We can use the craft department's wood and metal shop to craft revolutionary-era devices for sending a message to the bourgeoise.

Oh right, I forgot he’s gotta eat and put food on the table. Where are my manners?

Think of his yacht payments, how could you be so selfish.

Some of you need to learn how to park

That’s hardly the worst I’ve seen this morning

If youre so close to the car beside you that the driver cant get in, youre parked wrong or need to find a spot that fits your car. This is obnoxious.

Not me! I'm perfect.

What parking garage is that? The spaces look tiny

I used to work on MCV and used the 8th street parking deck. Some of the worst driving and parking there. People would be whipping it with staff/patients walking around, to or from their car 😵‍💫

Keep in mind the person to the left of him might’ve parked EVEN WORSE so he has to park off to the side. Happens to me more often than id like, I come out of the store and now I look like I cant park lol

If you get a spot by the pole, you have more room to navigate away from poor parkers.

Honestly it looks like the space is simply too small for the car. It looks like its drivers wheels are right on the yellow line.

Oh come on, that’s hardly a bad job of parking. There just isn’t enough space for that kind of vehicle in that spot.

Show the car beside it lol

Looks like Broad&Belvidere

Jefferson St Deck

I saw some dude driving down the decks at around 18mph, right before I was about to back out

i frequently find myself having to park next to someone who is suboptimally positioned and taking a quick video of their proximity to my car, my door that has no scratches or dings, and their license plate just incase

Maybe, but currently, that guy seems pretty far away.

I’d have to disagree, the driver certainly could have parked within the lines-

He pulled in at a 45 degree angle. It’s obvious. You can see it. Can none of you fucking drive?

It takes all of 5 seconds to back up and straighten out your parking job.

Its the Jefferson deck. I see trucks park there all the time with no issue, assuming they aren't in a compact only spot. This person is further to the right than I am guessing people realize. They gave themselves looots of room on the driver side.

Sure does. Those spaces are relatively small but definitely not designed for that tank of a Lexus.

Lmao having worked there for years and knowing half the people who park there, I used to see faculty and staff park in the dumbest ways. Not surprising when you work with them and get to know their personality.

That's so smart!

A lot of people fucking suck at driving, exemplified in this very comment section.

Ehh. I had an F150 when I lived at BB and I fit fine there and at the one on Henry. I park in their garages when I visit now in an Escalade and still fit, people just suck ass at parking on campus

Particularly in RVA.

PSA: DO NOT SWIM IN THE FUCKING FLOOD WATER. That is rain mixed with sewage water from the backed up drains. Do not swim in that. You are going to get hepatitis.

Let me find out that was my roommate, he cannot come back in until he showers for three days and prays outside of a church.

The amount of people I saw walking barefoot made me gag. I would much rather walk home in soggy shoes and socks than ever put my bare foot on the cement. Same energy with the people who were swimming in the fountain at Monroe park. I swear I've heard so many stories of homeless people peeing in that water.

Not to mention the other risks like -flood water can often be deeper than it looks and there could be dangerous currents -there could be wires knocked loose by the weather and the water could be electrified and then whoops! you are deep fried

i made the stupid decision to walk home while it was pouring and by the time i was halfway home it was up to my knees. two very nice strangers came up to me and held my hands so we all wouldnt get swept away, the water was so strong and literally hitting us in waves like it was the fucking beach. shout out to those girls would love to know who you were and praying i dont get a flesh eating virus. anyone who willingly splashed around in that shit is sick in the head

If you don't get hepatitis in college, you didn't do college right /s

It’s natural selection at this point from the videos I’ve seen…

i tried to swim in flood water

I've personally seen photo evidence of people shitting in there.. so yeah.

Who fucking raised these people

VCU actually won’t give you a diploma until you’ve gonna a disease at Ramen Spot

that man will be hospitalized with a prion disease in 36 hours

That man is gonna grow a third head from that oh my god

Wash your clothes, take a shower. If it didn’t get in your eyes, nose, or mouth, you didn’t pee while in the water, you didn’t touch the water with your hands and then touch your eyes nose or mouth, you’re probably fine. But take a shower. Scrub your shins and feet.

as long as you dont have any open wounds where the water touched you’re probably fine as long as you showered

A homeless person pulled me aside the other day to show me a dead squirrel

Can confirm, I've personally shit in that fountain.

What's wrong with Ramen Spot :(

Yeah, but on the bright side, these swimmer/bathers are probably all now immune from any Covid strain. Note: this is only a joke. If you've tried ivermectin and other right-wing Covid vaccine/cures, I'm talking to you. Do not swim in flood waters especially in a city. It's unhealthy and unsafe.

Prions don't work that fast. Cholera on the other hand.

why’d you do that brother

You’ll probably be okay! I’d count on it. This post was yelling at the kids who were literally swimming in it for fun.

Really convenient, central location, comfy in the right position. I totally recommend it. Don't knock it until you try it.

VCU Bans Delta Chi According to the [Richmond Times Dispatch](https://richmond.com/news/local/education/vcu-expels-delta-chi-finding-fraternity-responsible-for-violations-surrounding-the-death-of-a-student/article_4528cda9-93a2-50a3-af2e-ac72f17dc903.html#tracking-source=home-breaking) and [VCU](https://www.news.vcu.edu/latest/key-issues/VCU_Statement_on_Delta_Chi) the school has permanently expelled Delta Chi based on violating the universities policies on hazing, serving alcohol, COVID protocols and recruitment activities. The full report on greek life still being worked on and is expected to be released this summer, and the police are still investigating Adam Oakes's death.

Should have been done a lot sooner, but I am glad that VCU has finally taken care of something.

Graduated in 2012. These dudes have always sucked.

Graduated in ‘12. Those guys were the biggest group of douches around. Better late than never.

So will the students in the fraternity and/or known to be at the party be monitored by VCU for their future involvement in other fraternities? If they just all move their membership to another organization, we’re back at square 1.

It's good to see this kind of development in VA! As a pulsating arts school , VCU is bravely announcing it's stance against certain characters - blacking out additional noise in of a foreign alphabet, Chad will feel cleaner panhandling for parental disappointment. Even without the a**hole, we live in society

Good. Glad to see VCU do something about them

Once you join one fraternity, you can’t really go join another.

Delta Chi got banned..

You can if it was dissolved. Saw a few after SAE got kicked off campus.

Video of the generator exploding near Cary Street Gym

When was this

Is this what causes the outage yesterday?

that isn't a generator. It isn't even a transformer. that's just a Fuse blowing open on the line due to some fault downstream, and due to the high voltage and current on those lines, they make a hell of an arc as you saw when they open, especially during an overload, but that particular piece of equipment on that pole did exactly what it is intended to do. protect the rest of the equipment by isolating the area that contains a shorted line.

And it's not blowing up. That's the drop out falling out to protect the generator. Creates a big arc, which is super bright and loud.

Thank you for the correction!

Do VCU/RVA sidewalks bother you too? Hello there guys! If you live around the VCU area or go to school here you know the sidewalks are terrible. Specially the brick ones, they are missing pieces and are the perfect recipe for twisting and ankle. A few weeks ago I twisted my ankle on one of these sidewalks. It was specifically the one on Cathedral PI. One of my classmates from my human design class brought up the idea to work on a project to hopefully get it fixed as soon as possible so it doesn’t pose anymore danger to the VCU community. I wanted to see if anyone else feels annoyed at the fact that these sidewalks are messed up or if anyone has ever been injured from one of these sidewalks. What are your thoughts? Would you guys be interested in getting the sidewalk fixed? Comment down any thoughts!

I started at VCU in 1997. It was the same then. So...

That particular section of sidewalk is owned by the Catholic Diocese. Years ago that road was closed and the adjacent property owners became the owners of both the road and the sidewalks. It is in desperate need of repair. https://cor.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=c3ed34c0fb38441fb95cd2d2d6a22d48

Have you submitted a 311 request to have it fixed? https://www.rva311.com/rvaone#/

I walk there all the time. It’s like a mini game for me lol. Would be nice to have it fixed

The ones around VCU are much better than those in the surrounding neighborhoods. Go down to Oregon hill or carver and you’ll be thankful for vcu sidewalks. The brick looks nice but idk if it’s worth the maintenance. Especially with tree roots and shit.

yes dude its not handicap or wheelchair accessible and if they can spend so much money on new buildings and whatnot they can spend a few dollars on the sidewalks

Stay away from Williamsburg in that case.

I walk through this spot all the time for me it's not really a big deal to just go around it but idk

Thank you to everyone that has commented, this is really helping us with our research for the class project. :))

I understand if you have a wheelchair or crutches or some other thing where stability is most important. But for everyone else, respectfully stop using your phone for 5 minutes and look at the ground in front of you.

No, it's old and the preservation of the bricks is expensive and labor intensive. Calling in a city work order typically works or it used to. However of the things that I have to worry about during the course of a normal day it's a low priority. And probably should be for most

It's very annoying that they don't fix it. But it's been like that for a while so I guess no one cares. You just have to go around it. Would be nice if they fixed it though.

They are bad but I've never had a problem of rolling my ankle or almost falling. But don't get me started on all the low hanging tree branches on every sidewalk, feels like I'm playing limbo every time I walk to class

No they’re perfect. When I was a student, during the winter when it was oppressively cold outside and there was snow on the ground, I would listen to “The Song of The Volga Boatmen” and imagine I was walking down the ravaged streets of Stalingrad in the winter of 1941-42. Also I once absolutely smashed a bird scooter trying to get airtime off an upturned group of bricks. I miss it there

Before I started regularly visiting friends and my eventual move here, I had no idea the sidewalks were absolute shit. I came up for a NYE party and was one the phone to ask the address again and not paying attention to the sidewalk and it suddenly going up by two inches. My foot caught on it and I tripped and absolutely ate shit on that fall. My phone flew out of my hand, I only barely scraped my hands because of my gloves, and my shoe flew off and I scraped my foot so much it filled with blood and I was limping my way into the party and our several block walk to Carytown to see the ball rise. That was my lesson to always look at the fucking ground because the sidewalks will get you.

I’ve been past the one by the tree. Yes they do.

Yes I’m constantly tripping

I was at vcu in 99….it looks exactly the same 😂

Hey there, I sent you a message

I’m more bothered by the runners who refuse to use the sidewalks, even where it’s normal concrete in good shape. What’s the point in fixing the walks if people won’t use them anyway

Then, there's the sidewalks by 7-11's or corners of Broad and B's=COVERED in JIZZ!!!!!!!😏

Broke my first ukulele on this shit. Grace 😂

Nah side walk Cafe is the best!

I roll my ankle so often 💀

It’s always mystified me how the city has spent so much money over the last few years to make the curbs at intersections accessible, yet the rest of the sidewalk is hard to even walk. Church Hill is horrible!

I don’t think we have yet, thank you for suggesting that:)

Nah, they should fix the issue tbh

there are people who use wheelchairs or have vision problems who could get hurt attempting to utilize the sidewalk. they deserve to not walk in the middle of the street, i would think.

OmG that’s so crazy, I hope you’re okay now!

A lot of that has been federal grant money - not the city.

Well this was like 15 years ago so guess I’m alright

Doesn’t make it any less dumb

i mean you just said it should be a low priority, so how would that help?

New to VCU, I love everyone's outfits😭 This is pretty dumb, but I adore how everyone looks stunning😭 I was never really able to be as explorative of my feminine side (Im non-binary/AMAB) im previous years, but I love how I dont feel alone ig at VCU. Everyone looks absolutely stunning and I love everyone's outfits. I do love how I've been complimented on my overalls this past week🥹 that's it, just wanted yall to know that I love how fashion is a prominent thing at VCU, I cant get enough of it 😌🖤✨️

There's an Instagram account for this! Vcufits

Everyone loves their sense of fashion in Richmond generally!! Plus there are a bunch of lgbt+ people who go here (including myself!) Its so nice and refreshing to see people have such prominent personalities that you can see them all around you, even in their outfits alone :)

glad to know that you’re NOT talking about me cause i been wearing the most bum ass fits 💔

Not dumb at all!!! Everyone looks amazing

I realized i was trans and came out right before my senior year in undergrad at VCU (MtF) and was really nervous about presenting more fem especially out in public, so i get how you feel with not being able to explore your feminine side. But after I gained more confidence and a little time I really started to feel a lot more comfortable with it and started constructing some pretty outfits. I've been complimented a bunch wearing some fits and each time i still get that feeling that you felt. In short, keep rocking those outfits! 😌

what about folks who wear pajama clothes and fuzzy slippers even when it is dumping rain outside? not being rude (well sort of) but I am legitimately curious if it is some fashion thing or just “comfort”

I know, I follow it. Im hoping sometime soon I'll get my picture taken🥲😌

Im sure your first have been amazing😭 no one here has had bum ass fits

Ig it is kinda a mix of fashion and comfort, but mostly comfort. Again, I love seeing everyone's style and how they are comfortable in what they are wearing.

Accepted into Nursing! Highly excited and highly grateful! Only school I applied too as well haha!

Congratulations 🎉

Congratulations! 🎉

OMG Congratulations!! That's so exciting, did you finish all your pre-req's before applying? I'm stumped on finishing and the applying or applying now with just 2 more due.

Congrats Cl!

Congratulations!!!

congratulations! well deserved😁 you'll be a wonderful nurse!!

congratulations ❤️❤️❤️!! future nurse in the making <33!

Thank you so much!!

Thank you so much!

Heyy! I got accepted as well. You don’t have to have all your pre reqs completed. As long most are done but if you have two left that is ok. You just need it completed before you start the program.

That’s a blessing , and you got this!!!! I often tell myself “if I don’t finish it now then when because I do not want to be stuck in the same place in five years” I had everything done just bc I’ve been in CC two yrs but as someone replied I think long as you have the five or so required pre req classes done before you apply that’s all you need. The other gen Ed’s n pre reqs need to be done before you start classes and the rest throughout the program

Thank you so much!!!!

Thank you so much!!

Thank you so very much!!!!

Oo! Congratulations as well! Thank you for that clarification. What did your application look like? I've been stressing so hard to make my application look good. Were you a transfer, or did you do your classes completely at VCU>?

Omg hi u got accepted for fall 25!

I like that, I was forcing myself to get through those classes even if was begging and pleading for a break. I went through CC first, and I transferred over here at VCU. Another question, did all of your credits transfer smoothly?

My daughter just finished her 1st year and has loved every minute!! It’s stressful but very much worth it

I transferred from community college after getting my associates. I think they like seeing you getting experience and involved in sort of way with healthcare. I did put all my work experience as a cna. And essay is a huge factor too. There you can show why your passionate in pursuing a nursing degree. Make it sentimental in some way. As for gpa, its good to have a good one but not always. Experience is key… I had. 3.6

Hey! I was accepted as a transfer, and I attended an info session beforehand and they said they only considered 4 things for acceptance: accumulative gpa, prerequisites, references, and personal statements! I also have work experience as a cna but our experience unfortunately did not matter when filling out the app. Due to that, I decided to talk about my experience through my essay as a way to mention it, but through the application questions itself, they do not look at that section, or most of the other sections beside the 4 things mentioned.

My apologies just now seeing this, yess they did!! I transferred from an LA CC so the things they weren’t sure about; they did me an unofficial transcript evaluation and looked at what the class was based on to match whatever class they had if that makes sense!

I appreciate that! It was the only school I applied to so I very much hoped that I got in. Congrats to your daughter and I hope that she keeps striving and pushing through any obstacles ❣️

I’m glad it’s a great school I heard Richmond is nice as well

Congratulations!!!!!

Congratulations!!!!!!

It was also the only program my daughter applied too, so I totally get your excitement!! You are going to do great things!!

Thank you so much, you sound more supportive than my mother haha

You are going to do amazing things, don’t let anyone tell you otherwise!!

Saw me cooked on the library floor You caught me laid out on the floor during a study break. You smiled. I blinked and you were gone. I was gonna say something, but you disappeared like a study break hallucination. If you see this tell me what you were studying. I owe you a better first impression.

That shoe one had to be B.S., who takes their shoes off to go into a public bathroom?!

Lol explain?

lost a lot of money on this degree lol

Surprised that troll post got over 30 upvotes.

his response was “well who steals shoes” and btw i’ve seen muslim students wash their hands and feet before prayer so that maybe?

People are retarded.

No, he said it was because he didnt want to get pee on his shoes. He was either trolling or mentally challenged

Nice. But I’m still scared to go to the bathroom

Thank god, it was super fucked up. Where tf do we have a glory hole?

Did the police start investigating? Did VCU start investigating? This is disgusting and we need to know this can’t happen again.

Wait what was this account

Yah, I am gonna be avoiding all restrooms that aren't one person bathrooms or that have stalls.

Someone said the library

From the looks of it, it seemed like the male bathroom in basement of the library

A vcu student posting videos of male students in stalls and at the urinal to their two twitter accounts and two 'fan accounts' where people pay for access to the videos they post. Its an invasion of privacy to start, but since the videos are of random students and people, there may have been a chance that one could be underage which is VERY illegal

Oh I assumed they were putting little cameras in the stalls lmao.

Fuck, hope they patch it up

Is this anyone’s cat? My friend and I found this cat near the Singleton Center. Based on their weight and friendliness and how clean they are, we assume she’s a lost pet.

Will you please call me 804-514-0413. this is my dad’s cat! Thank you!

Biscuit is home! Thanks everyone!

The second pic of his stumpy legs got me lol hope the sweet baby finds his home

Following. My daughter sent me a pic of this cat last night and said it was so sweet she was worried it was lost.

i saw them back during early spring semester and i had assumed they’re an outside cat. they look just as healthy as when i saw them before, too

She looks like Cleo, a stray cat my neighbor feeds. She’s usually around the alley at Ryland and Grace. My neighbor’s name is John, he’s kind of older and uses crutches but you should talk to him if you ever see him! He’s super nice

I think this might be my dads cat

I saw this cat as I was going to Cabell at around 9pm tonight! Right by singleton center again

I also recently found this cat, gave it back to the owner after getting it micro chipped and within 2 days the cat was back on the streets. No collar saying the cat has an owner, no nothing. I don’t know what the owner assumes is going to happen to a cat roaming the streets of Richmond.

Tag that cat incase like Francine

guys please just read the required stuff in the beginning of the year freshmen, i have no beef against you, but it is so annoying when you guys ask questions that the answers are quite literally mapped out to you by VCU resources before you even get here. i know this is probably going to be received negatively, but you do look unprepared and incapable if you ask simple/basic questions that about the general VCU system. there are so many emails, websites, guides, etc that are specifically created to answer these questions and they really are not hard to read. please y’all, just use your resources before you ask a stupid question on this sub

That and posting their entire schedule with their location on the internet for everyone to see… I thought I was going crazy!

as a freshman. yeah i dont get how some ppl here r so hardheaded

If you work at the Commons you’ll really get a taste for people who don’t know how to Google lol

I know its like this sub has just become freshman asking if “they’re cooked” for one reason or another

And y’all talk to much in class and it’s annoying this is not a high school classroom !!! Stay focus y’all college is not a game !!!

No the amount of times it’s one quick google search to find their answer

That and the fucking “is crime serious at vcu 🥺🥺🥺” like idk just walk around and find out, or see the other 80 million times it’s been posted on this sub

If you’re an upperclassman, this is sad. This is the reason freshman are so scared of asking questions. You know what it was like to be in their shoes, it’s a completely new experience. They don’t need to be shit on for asking basic questions when their lives are completely changing. This is just so immature. A question that’s stupid to you is completely different than a question that’s stupid to someone else. Instead of insulting the freshmen that ask questions, why don’t you answer them and break the cycle?

This is why people are scared to ask any basic questions. Google has answers, but they also have answers from random years. Maybe they just want to do things right and not mess up due to anxiety. Jesus.

No and it will literally be the EASIEST schedule ever and they say "am I cooked" like wtf no you're taking classes like every other student at fucking VCU

for real, freshmen (like myself) will be scared to ask questions that they think are stupid because of this exact thing.

Literally, be yourself. People who ask questions get answers. Don’t be afraid. You’re going to do great!!!

Saw these snowmen on a bench in Monroe Park :) Saw these guys on the way back from Ram City, looks like whoever made them used boxes for the torso. Pretty clever, very cute overall :)

VCU fraternity is suspended four years for hazing, alcohol use

The fraternity is Kappa Sigma for anyone interested

after that kid died a couple years ago, VCU is in zero tolerance mode.

Nice pay wall 👍

Only four years?

To side step the paywall, hit the reader button. Copy/pasted for your convenience: VCU fraternity is suspended four years for hazing, alcohol use Virginia Commonwealth University suspended a fraternity for four years over hazing and repeated alcohol violations. The suspension of Kappa Sigma occurred in May but was not previously reported. The fraternity is the third student organization to receive a multiyear suspension since the spring. After VCU increased its education and prevention efforts around hazing, university leaders expected students to report more violations, leading to more punishments, said university spokesperson Michael Porter. vcu campus icon Virginia Commonwealth University in May suspended Kappa Sigma for four years over hazing and repeated alcohol violations. The fraternity is the third student organization to receive a multiyear suspension since the spring. Mike Kropf, TIMES-DISPATCH Headquartered in Charlottesville, Kappa Sigma bills itself as the world’s largest college social fraternity with more than 200,000 members. The university initiated an investigation in January after someone reported an incident, according to the university’s website. VCU officials determined that in the spring of 2023, the fraternity required new members to clean cars of older members and line up to be quizzed by older members. People are also reading… A semester later, the group required new members to conduct daily weather reports, carry pledge packs, clean older brothers’ houses, deliver meals and perform calisthenics in a basement. Pledge packs often contain items fraternity brothers might want, such as cigarettes, snacks and medicine. Older students hazed new members by forcing them to consume milk and spicy food, Porter said. New members were interrogated in an intimidating or threatening manner, verbally abused and made to wear indecent clothing. In recent years, Kappa Sigma held four events with alcohol and served it to underage students, according to the university. At one party, a fight occurred, and a student had minor injuries. At another, police responded twice telling the students they were making too much noise. The university put sanctions on the group, but Kappa Sigma failed to comply with them, the university said. Last year, VCU placed the fraternity on deferred suspension, in which the organization was given the chance to follow school policy and avoid a harsher punishment. Having not met the school’s standard, Kappa Sigma was given a suspension in May that will lift in the spring of 2028. The fraternity’s national headquarters also suspended the chapter. Kappa Sigma, which did not respond to a request for comment, isn’t the only student group that received a long-term suspension in the spring. Pre-professional fraternity Delta Epsilon Mu was suspended for two years over psychological hazing, and sorority Phi Mu received a four-year penalty for buying and selling prescription pills on a student communication app. Another group, Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity, is on interim suspension while the university conducts its student behavior process. Eight VCU student groups have received multiyear sanctions since 2022. After VCU student Adam Oakes died in a hazing incident in 2021, state legislators passed a law requiring universities to publish the violations of student organizations, known as Adam’s Law. Now, student organizations are required to participate in in-person hazing-prevention training. Students also have a fuller understanding of what constitutes hazing, Porter said, leading them more often to report it. “It is a demonstration of the community’s growing unwillingness to tolerate behavior and to move toward culture change across all student organizations,” Porter added. Since the fall of 2023, 17 of VCU’s 480 student organizations violated the student code of conduct, including four for hazing, Porter said. Tracking the news What happened: Virginia Commonwealth University suspended the Kappa Sigma fraternity for four years. The background: The suspension was over hazing and repeated alcohol violations, VCU said. Kappa Sigma has more than 200,000 members. The other suspensions: It is the third student organization to receive a multiyear suspension since the spring.

I was a pledge in fall of 2000, as a sophomore, to Pi Kapp. Two pledges had to go to the hospital with alcohol poisoning. Charter was revoked for a few years. Funny to see this, realize Pi Kappa Phi not only came back, but got kicked off campus again for the same thing two decades later, and had their whole charter revoked. FAFO I guess. I had my fun, went to parties and drank cheap beer and danced with cute chubby girls. Worth it. https://preview.redd.it/n6wjoc3ojopd1.jpeg?width=1125&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1ccbba704758171125573031c442ff100d310dcb

I thought frats would die with my generation (43). Even guys that I am friends who were in frats for years said it was a waste of time and money.

There is zero reason to be in a fraternity. Not one reason is actually beneficial and I was in one for a few semesters before realizing it’s all bs

I still feel good when I was in college every halloween me and my friends would drive by every frat party and egg the houses

Shout out To the Phi D bruhz on the yard.

And this is why d9 fraternities are the only real fraternities

In pledging or avoiding?

Actual life saver right here fr

Not all hero’s wear capes - really appreciate this!

You might be able to read the article today, but definitely tomorrow by logging into the VCU library and searching for the Richmond Times Dispatch, the previous days print articles are available to read that way. Alternatively, you can usually read an article or two by clearing your cookies and using a InPrivate tab. I've also have read that "printing" the article bypasses the paywall (but never have tried it). Also, all reports for suspended and banned organizations can be found here: [Student Organization Conduct Report - Division of Student Affairs - Virginia Commonwealth University (vcu.edu)](https://students.vcu.edu/departments/leadership-and-involvement/fraternity-and-sorority-life/registered-student-organization-rso-conduct-report/)

Not the chubby girls catching strays

There will always be young men that believe joining a frat will get them laid lol

Idk brother i had a fuckin blast in mine lol

Lmao the divine nine do more hazing than any other fraternity

Facts. Lifelong bonds, not just the 4-5 years you are in undergrad.

No strays from this direction, married a cute chubby girl.

Girls do love going to frat parties 😂

Ye homie not everyone had that experience lol. Good for you tho

Cross the burning sands with me... IF YOU DARE! YES, this is true!

Not everyone had the guy’s experience either tho ho man

Pretty much

Rao in 2020

I HAVE A PLAN STUDENTS

> We have chosen to come back as scheduled for an in-person fall semester because we have a community with varying needs. We have created different models of working and learning to accommodate those needs. We have invested significant time and effort to offer the Covid-19 testing capacity necessary for the safety of our community and the ability to carry out that testing. We have the expertise of a nationally premier health system, which has been on the front lines of this health crisis since the beginning, to assist us in our return. And, most importantly, we have trust in each other, recognizing that fostering a safe return to campus depends on our shared commitments. Are we doing in person? I feel like I'm going to puke.

AND IT INVOLVES TAHITI.

We're gonna do in-person for three or four weeks, until hundreds of students and faculty test positive for the virus, then everyone will get sent home with only 50–75% refunds for housing/meal plans and nothing for library, tech, and lab fees, and then the admin will send out a carefully worded letter about how no one could have seen this coming and we're praying for everyone's health, but you all forfeited your rights to sue us in the fine text of this semester's tuition contracts, so tough titties, y'all. And Rao will get another raise.

All my classes still say they'll be online on eservice you may want to look at that unless they haven't updated it.

But other courses are 75% online. Or not online. Which means that large numbers of students and faculty still must return to campus, which is not a good idea right now. He should have delayed.

VCU releases pro-Palestinian campus activist’s degree after over 2 months

Ty for this update

Maybe VCU will open its Children’s Hospital for all the children starving in Gaza…

I doubt it.

Happy snow day!

VCU Arts is #3 in the nation.... https://preview.redd.it/t31fpdmgqlie1.png?width=3024&format=png&auto=webp&s=1115c01e73d72a435b9bdcfe0997b67cfebb666a

How are the sidewalks? I haven’t been outside since around 10 AM

The real trix is to do one on of the top deck of the parking garages that can be seen from the dorms.... I'm not saying todo that...that would be a bad idea. Definitely don't.

beautiful shot

I need to know for tomorrow

Slushy walkable or slushy icy?

It’s walkable, you just have to be careful

Can someone tell me how the sidewalks around the gym are that’s my concern 😭

Did everyone at vcu get this email? Not really sure what to do with this information. Any thoughts?

1. Yes, everyone got it 2. There's not much more to say about it at the moment, they're probably just trying to get on top of everyone panicking about federal student loans, federally funded labs, etc after yesterday's White House debacle

Yeah, not really sure what to think about all this in general. There’s so many executive orders stacked on top of each other, they aren’t even able to handle 1 situation at a time. Sucks for everybody smh

We boutta be Virginia Common no wealth university after this one

Saying something without saying anything.

My bet it is part of VCU's risk management strategy to send out notices like this whenever a government branch implements changes. This could be due to shifts in funding, grants, or other factors impacted by the orders.

MIT sent a similar email telling all researchers to stop spending money unless they are paying out I’d their own pocket.

i hate that fat ass orange we have in the white house 🙁

My friend's trans child was just told by their doctor at VCU that they cannot begin hormone blockers in April when they turn 16. That has been the plan for a year.

Just in time for the State of the University Address speech tomorrow

I go to UNC and we got the same email

Funny, I have affiliations at Duke and Vanderbilt. Amazing how it’s almost work for word the same email.

Whoever composed this is not a good writer.

Omg CHILL PEOPLE!! They want to stop wasting our money. How is that an argument. Our taxes pay for condoms in Gaza????? They don’t need condoms. They want to procreate. They use condoms to make bombs. Thats why they froze funds and when they realized the domino effect they fixed it, rather than ignoring and denying it. Idk about everyone else-but I like money, and I like to keep my money. I paid for my college myself, I will not pay for others who a contract to pay and now feel entitled to break a contract. Not ethical, and not a lesson to teach our youth. Besides-anyone with a worthy degree (not art history or Taylor swift studies) most companies offer loan reimbursements. Also, there’s financial aid for those on the lowest income levels. Loans mean your family makes enough money and they are willing to give you a loan. No credit checks, no questions asked. Of that want taxpayers to pay student loans then maybe change the process to procure a student loan. Credit checks? Or abide by the contract signed. Also-look at some of the studies being funded by funneling money. They give small animals cocaine and then study sex habits. And such nonsense. So everyone CHILL!!!! Let the governed shrink. Then those who truly need help-the funding will be available when the rot is gone. I was kicked off Medicaid and I was way under the limit. But non-taxing paying non-citizens have medical insurance. And my child is SSI disabled with a heart condition that causes SIDS. THEY DROPPED MY MEDICAID!!!! We pay taxes, we are under the limit by 20k and they can’t explain why I was taken off Medicaid. My daughter was refused. They let us have a plan eyes an 8k monthly amount we had to hit before they kick in. Our county is a business and this isn’t how a business is run. Also-it’s not as absurd as people think and if you know your US Hx and the constitution more people would understand what is really going on.

I so hate to be that person but can some one send me a credibility cited link to the Gaza condom misinformation info. Unfortunately, fact checkers are losing the people’s confidence and fast. Esp after the Laptop from hell and all the Covid coverups. If it’s not properly cited, if i can’t easily find the sourse cited-I won’t read it. I just read Rand Paul’s Deception. Almost 100 pages of citation-including senate transcripts and FOIA requests. Reading that book taught me to check, and double check every single source. And question everything. Bc texts what science really is-social or medical science. Ask questions-even the crazy ones

word salad that isn’t even trying to sound coherent. it sounds like a child got a hold of a thesaurus and picked some words at random. god this institution is a joke.

So much word salad

Isn't this double speak about all of the current international students who have participated in certain activities and will be losing student visas?

every University and college has gotten a very similar email . but in short, President trump signed an executive order to freeze all federal funding for all agencies, which included the department of education. luckily, A federal judge was able to rescind that order as it was illegal for him to so. I beileve it was also the same judge who paused his executive order on terminating birthright citizenship

does this mean i can’t get my FAFSA money? :(

He said a whole lot of nothing

Hey I know this is r/vcu but I go to UofMemphis and I got a similar email.

Thank you for a respectable informative response.

DEI and Critical Race Theory is now classified as illegal race discrimination according to Title 9. VCU will get its federal funding revoked it if it continues to promote these. VCU is panicking right now and the course catalogue for next semester will likely look VERY different

All the colleges are stressed now that racial discrimination is completely illegal and their federal funding is in jeopardy if they continue to engage in illegal activities.

Powerful statement

Maybe vote better next election?? Not much else we can do.

Francine is such a powerful way I live in Richmond...what's next?..the Kroger on Lombardy?.…d@d?

Cry some more

Yesterdays White House debacle- dear god what did I miss

Not to mention research

I’m DEAD 😂😭

☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️

I mean statistically that's already the case of the student body. Have you seen some of the earnings out of school?

The VCU admin special

Yes and I think a lot of higher ed are mindful their public messages could be plucked and put in wider media ecosystems and no one wants a target on their back from this current administration 🫠 the more vague the better at this time?

Times over little socialist...

Such bullshit. They’ve been giving puberty blockers to cis teenagers for decades for other medical reasons no problem, but god forbid a teenager goes on a temporary, reversible medication to prevent permanent changes to their body that would bring great distress until they get themselves figured out. I hate it here.

The condom story was fact checked and that wasn’t true. Some organizations who get funded from the government send condoms to countries like Africa. Biden never sent 50 million dollars worth of condoms to Gaza. Medicaid expansion is available in 41states but not the rest. Not sure why Medicaid was To stop wasting money maybe start with the “pork” in all bills that all of Congress adds to. Yes, some research seems far fetched but taking money from public education for vouchers to charter or faith based schools is showing more of a scam than a help. Many of us agree there is government waste but actually look at where excessive spending is and how it affects the people. If you want to stop grants to universities fine, but the conditions of what a school teaches should not be up to the government. States control their own curriculums. If you don’t want to spend your money at that university; don’t. Changing history to reflect less embarrassment for white people is insane. Undocumented workers actually pay a lot in taxes. Many have ITIN numbers which pays into Medicare and Social Security that they can’t use. If they have health insurance, it is state funded. They can’t get Medicaid. The student loan debacle is a crisis with tuition increasing exorbitantly and wages not rising with it. Agree that students and parents need to stop looking at the “college experience” and maybe consider community college than transfer to 4 year college and everybody doesn’t have to go to an expensive, well known college for status. CHILL. Maybe but stop the blackmail and just focus on real waste and not indoctrination of white only history, book banning and pushing religion in public schools.

The point is the states need to control their own state. Which is why FEMA will be dismantled and let the states handle it with funding directly to them. School choice-it’s up to us parents what our kids are taught, where, and how. I don’t like the public school and the “everyone must be the same” when the real world isn’t like that. If my son can fix any behavior issues by being in the back of the room and standing at a desk rather than sitting and it effects no one that should be okay, right. It solves many problems allowing him to stand. But if he does it then the other kids want to do it (5th grade) instead they want him medicated and sitting. Look I’m conflicted about Trump. Idk how I feel but something has to change and what we have been doing isn’t working. Federal govt wants meant to be this large. Medicaid is also state. In fact in Ny it’s county. The federal govt is the issue. It is too big! But the states have more power than people realize. I mean half the states ignore federal law and have legalized pot-in really don’t want to hear people complain about the states not having power. They have power.

It’s really not that. But what Trump has been trying to do bring up the revenue for the country by cutting federal funds all together as well as programs and opportunities that mainly benefit Low income people. Which economically that wouldn’t work And with discrimination in colleges, it is common that students or Color or Students with a Religion that isn’t christianity or LTBQ+ discriminated. Female students(regardless of what race they are) have also been a recent strong target for being discriminated Especially at Elite schools like USC and vanderbilt. DEI literal purpose is to PREVENT such discrimination to anyone regardless of race, gender, Religion, sexuality or whatever.

I don't know what news sources you have access to, so in order to avoid a paywall, Google "white house federal funding freeze" and brace yourself.

Because everyone that doesn’t like Trump is a socialist. Weird bubble you live in.

stop talking to me i don’t like u maga cult members… I REBUKE✝️✝️✝️✝️✝️✝️

Did you refuse the Trump stimulus checks? Opt out of SS, 401k or Medicare? Hope you don't have any money in an FDIC bank either 🤷‍♀️

Me, too. Things are awful right now.

You are clearly clueless as illustrated by the fact that female enrollment in colleges significantly outpace men. Some medical schools have women enrollment that are 2-3 times higher than men.

thankfully it was stopped temporarily and the administration rescinded it, but i’m sure there’s another draft being worked on as we speak..

Down the rabbit hole I go

Warren W. Brandt's Dog Hello everyone, I'm sure you all know of Warren W. Brandt, the first president of VCU who died in 2017 after a series of strokes. What many of you may not know, was that he had a dog named Bree at the time, a beagle that was a bit overweight from table scraps and loved to go on walks with her dad. Bree came into my family's possession because my stepmother was Dr. Brandt's nurse and nobody in the family wanted poor Bree. We loved her and gave her the best life she could have, but sadly, she was put down today as the vets found a tumor in her stomach after two days of not eating. On a hopeful note though, she is reunited with her wonderful owner and finally gets to run like the lively, young dog she once was.

What a sweet post. Thanks for sharing and sorry for your family's loss.

Never change, VCU.

it's funny because they know each other right?

Higher learning

Guy paid me to act as a victim in a staged prank like this. Ended up getting millions of views on YouTube, so that was cool! Lol

in a perfect world yes……in richmond? i’m not so sure lol

Ouch! If cars have the green light... You Shall Not Pass!

what did bro think was gonna happen… 💀

That kid didn't get hit by a car, that kid hit a car.

I hope you offer this video to VCU so they can use it to help educate folks to obey traffic rules!

How can someone be this stupid...

If they just went straight they’d have probably missed the cars through dumb luck, but they skillfully turned left to make sure that didn’t happen

These scooters are a nuisance. Also just a side note you are no longer a pedestrian when you are riding and not walking e-scooters and must obey motorist traffic laws.

To be fair, I was crossing when it was my right to go and a car nearly turned me into a pancake after flying through a red light. The drivers here are ridiculous here as well.

Very lucky that wasn’t far worse

And these are the same kids I see coming into the ED every single day 🙃

An entitled kiddie car rider? Say it *ain't* so.

If someone has to be “educated” on not riding a scooter into oncoming traffic they might just be a lost cause.

it's not going to teach anyone anything that they don't already know

Virginia public education.

That is right. Posts like this take the focus from the subject that really matters. The kid there was completely wrong, but I drive here and see far worse from drivers.

Half of the alumni from vcu…. All just walking when they’re not supposed to walk

I don't agree. A couple of years ago 2 people lost their lives when they walked into traffic w/o having the right of way(if memory serves). After these deadly accidents VCU and/or the City of Richmond installed a series of speed humps in the most heavily trafficked areas in and around campus. Many of the traffic signals were programmed to include a 2-4 second gap between the walk sign and green lights, giving pedestrians time to begin crossing before drivers entered the intersections. VCU PD spent more time, especially at the start of semesters, on foot patrols at the busiest intersections, to educate pedestrians and enforce the rules. To anyone who watches that video it may cause them to be more mindful when moving around campus. If parents of students see the video it may cause some of them to plead with their student/ child to be more mindful. You are certainly right that perhaps no one will change anything about their behaviors, and there will still be terrible, deadly encounters. But taking prudent steps to influence the outcomes is a good idea.

one of the best states for public education in the country

Young masculine hubris powered by testosterone.

Same thing at gmu, it's crazy how no one knows right of way

One of those was a student crossing improperly (the first one in that spring semester). If I recall, the other person was struck while on the sidewalk.

Im glad this is on video. This way we don't waste a bunch of time and money on stuff that would have no effect on this... This way, we won't install 800 speed bumps that scrap the bottom of cars.

15th. https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/rankings/education

Speed bumps are great. One of the most effective traffic calming measures. If you scrape your car, you’re either going too fast, you need to come at it at a bit of an angle, or your car does not have enough clearance (14 inch minimum bumper height is what I’m reading as the state law).

Well, hotdog, I'm glad you don't exaggerate when you try to make a point. I think you meant "scrape", not "scrap", unless you think every vehicle driving over a speed hump has their vehicle immediately sent to a junkyard as scrap? Try slowing TF down when approaching the humps, since that is the point. You might try reading about the differences between speed bumps and speed humps. I think a lot of vehicles would be turned to scrap if you drove over a speed bump at 35 mph. A speed hump is intended to be driven over, but at a lower, safer, speed.

florida #2 🥀

The average ground clearance for a sedan generally falls in the range of 4 to 7 inches.. from Google. You tend to scrape after the front wheels go over... Your typical sport car is worse ...

Not if you drive a car that is low to the ground.....

Well, in that case, I'd bet most people would be comfortable with a few dozen pedestrian deaths each year so that you can drive your low-rise car at whatever speed you can get away with. And for anyone who disagrees with you, just mow 'em down. And then sue the carcass for damaging your car when they are pushed through your windshield.

You’re either missing the point or ignoring it. People who are going to speed will speed regardless. Most of the recent incidents involve pedestrians stepping into traffic and getting injured or killed. Then the response is always the same — more “traffic calming” measures and speed bumps. But if someone’s doing 55 mph down Campus Drive, lowering the speed limit isn’t going to change anything for those people. Honestly, having this on camera might at least show the folks who always demand someone “do something” about traffic that sometimes the issue isn’t the cars — it’s the common sense that was missing long before. Yes, there would be fewer deaths if people did not run infront of traffic i agree.

Feel entitled much? Your only objection to previously-enacted changes affects you because you worry about the underside of your car. Here's hoping you enjoy your working years at your closest Pizza Hut. I am certain that if you burden the rest of us with offspring down the road, you'll simply forgive and forget your future children's deaths in your quest to be unencumbered by the need to be careful while driving around in your 2 cylinder baby.

To the student on campus who had this cat on their shoulder near Cabell Library: Thank you for making my day and I love your cat so much.

Oh I saw her the other day! The cat ran onto some steps and it made me laugh

He’s on tik tok @tofumur

Awww, what a sweetie

Omg I will have to check it out! Thank you!

PSA: Marijuana use in Monroe Park Link: https://news.vcu.edu/article/2025/09/making-safe-choices-at-vcu-what-you-should-know?fbclid=IwZnRzaAMxCtRleHRuA2FlbQIxMQABHrVC_ue1X3jZYWPNOth-27S06S3fy3jLsiWClQP39VXXdNwzst6C0Sut7GoK_aem_KQuSWY0J2f67ZCVUcOmoAg

Who is calling the police about people smoking at the park lol Richmond got more serious shit to worry about

Just go to the river like a normal person

Monroe Park is owned by the city so VCU can’t penalize you academically. Marijuana use is decriminalized, the fine is $25 and doesn’t go on your record, although to my understanding multiple offenses may result in higher violations. Don’t have any small bags, a scale, or more than an ounce on you unless you want to be charged with a misdemeanor.

They can't catch us all...

Too many people hear legal and go full send. Virginia Beach’s Oceanfront is a prime example of how stupid people can be on that topic.

It’s not worth it to do it in Monroe Park. It’s out in the open, basically on campus, and in direct line of sight of many cops. Just find a more discreet place to do it. You definitely don’t want to have issues like this at VCU. They’ll go after you

this is fake you can always smoke in monroe park and they will never do anything unless you’re blatantly smoking in front of an officer which would be campus police which won’t do anything but tell you to stop/ pour your bong water out for you

Just a reminder, the 1-ounce and under limit is for those 21 and older, if you're under 21 and caught with pot even if you aren't actively smoking it not only will you get hit with the misdemeanor fine and it confiscated, but likely will have to go to court where the judge can assign you to the 8-hour program that the post talks about as that's a Virginia thing, not just VCU. This is similar to what can happen if you're caught underage with alcohol...

Out here saving the world!!

We live close to UR. They rent houses in the neighborhood. One year they got in a fight with my neighbor, they were having a rager and he asked them to be more respectful lol. Anyway, he called the school. All parting stopped. They will 100% hold you accountable when you are a UR student, it’s their brand. Campus or not.

I am actually concerned about people doing it at Monroe It’s a busy area with car traffic, scooters, and all types of people. Not being aware of your surroundings (like when high) could be dangerous Keep it to the river

Imagine being a narc. Richmond pussies got nothing better to do

I feel like we should all gather in the park and have a smoke out 👀

Stop buying stuff off the streets. It's risky both legally and in your health. We now have a clean & affordable store @ North Adams and 102 W broad. Hours are open from 12-8 Letssmokeva.com

Speaking of, anyone wanna smoke and hang?

i was smoking with friends and an officer shined his flashlight in my eyes talking about a 25 dollar fine…

What the fuck is even the point of going anymore!

Fuckin lame

If you get caught a second time.. do you have to take the course again?

When I was smoking a joint two years ago in Monroe Park, a VCU officer just told us we couldn’t do it there, he didn’t take our joint or like question us or anything like that

Vcu cops are insane about weed. Acting like it's a huge bust taking away a joint

REEFER MADNESS

I’ll take the $25 fine please and thank you

Yet it’s ok to smoke it in the dorms

The law is actually *up to* an ounce. Not under.

That park shouldn’t belong to VCU literally half of Richmond City belongs to VCU

I like how the police define a small amount as under an ounce these days 😅

Probably freshman, they’re still learning how RVA works.

karen’s for sure

Cry if they do, cry if they don’t

Maybe parents with young children? It is a park...

No…the problem is people smoking marijuana at the park. No body wants to smell that.

Or take a gummy 🤷🏻‍♂️

VCU can (and will) still penalize as a student conduct violation (rather than an academic integrity violation).

So confidently incorrect

Yes. They absolutely can penalize you academically, on or off campus.

Small bags, scales and more than an ounce constitutes distribution which is a class 5 felony. 1-5 years. Also, just because you do something off campus doesn’t mean vcu can’t penalize you.

No, you can’t. Just because folks are to the extent that people are calling it in (which I definitely don’t agree with), that is not the current law on the books. Be discrete.

I second this, I've smoked there out in the open on many occasions and never got into trouble. Plus, there are so many people smoking weed in Monroe Park at any given moment it's almost like a gas cloud surrounds the area. How many people are they trying to reprimand?

i just always use j’s or a small pipe and keep an eye out for cops

Unless you have other items that constitute distribution, then it’s still a felony.

It doesn’t belong to VCU

That’s what is in the state statute…

As someone that used to be a law enforcement dispatcher, 100%. They’re the worst

Call the police on people who smoke cigs too then narc

Really even if you’re off-campus? Everything that I’m reading is saying otherwise in the [student policies and procedures.](https://conduct.students.vcu.edu/policy-and-resources/student-code-of-conduct/)

Is this what the youths say?😂

He just wasn't vibing today.

Lol #too relatable.

Vibes werent right

Been a student worker for 3 years — now they take away our breaks and send people home? I took a photo of a sign that was posted on the office door. If this is my third year working here, why have they only now implemented this policy? I’m a student worker who does 8-hour shifts three days a week, on top of classes. So I can’t get a 15, just a 30. Students also aren’t allowed to join the workers’ union. Management regularly sends people home, which makes us short-staffed. I work at the restaurant that brings in the most customers and money on campus, so it’s confusing. Food rushes are stressful when you’re tired and can’t take a break because the managers sent five people home. I remember when I worked there my second year, one of the managers made me work in the kitchen by myself, just me and the cook. They left and said they would be right back, coming back 15 minutes later asking me why I had so many orders on the screen. Last year we brought in $4 million dollars in sales, one of the manager came to us excited. But what does that mean for us workers? This is the first year I haven’t gotten a 50 cent raise but a dollar raise. We aren’t allowed overtime anymore either. Last year I made 500 in one week from my overtime, this year it’s 270. Because this is my primary income, I cannot just quit like that. But I will start searching for jobs nearby that allows me to work early morning shift again.

please look for other jobs there are plenty of restaurant opportunities in richmond

Goodness where did you find this? I understand if you don’t want to leak your place of work though

This may be illegal. Not for adults, but if they have anyone that's 17 and working, they legally have to provide a 30 minute break every 5 hours.

Aramark is frustrating, but Virginia's laws are very "pro-employer". Any good employer will have some additional concessions even for employees who aren't disabled. Working off campus at certain restaurants will allow you to make more than you could hope to make at Aramark's near-minimum stuff.

CNU also started this policy when the semester started. It absolutely sucks.

unless youre making like 20+ an hour, get outta there lol

Wow, incredibly disappointing. If I knew as a customer what they were doing, that shop certainly wouldn’t be my first choice

Sadly, 6 hours for a 30 minute break is the law. And for what it’s worth, Aramark runs on campus dining. Not the university. They are the ones setting this asinine policy.

Not allowing students to join the workers’ union is evil.

Looks to be specific, that wouldn't fly for where I used to work. Also different parts of vcu have different internal rules. Still sucks that happened

You'll make so much more money at any restaurant in the city. Don't do college dining. Was a SAM at Virginia tech and there was no benefits to working on campus vs off.

Pretty sure that violates osha

Sorry, legally you have to take a 30 minute break after 6 hours which is unpaid. As for the 15 minute paid breaks, those are a courtesy provided. Virginia has no law mandating those unfortunately. Welcome to the South.

As far as I know this is unfortunately the Virginia law — I used to work at Target and they made clear that their break policy was mildly better than Virginia’s only because they follow national standards throughout the corporation (IIRC: four hours = a paid 15, 6 hours = a paid 15 and unpaid 30, over 6 hours = 2 paid 15s and 1 unpaid 30 … if anyone else has worked at a VA target correct me if I’m wrong it’s been a year). But (again, IIRC) they were clear that it was above the Virginia policy. I’m a student worker too, although I don’t work in a restaurant. Our policy is also that over 6 hours gets you a 30. No 15s. For me, I’m working at a desk and I spend most of my time doing homework anyway, so it’s not a problem at all. But in a high stress kitchen environment (especially one as busy as you describe, I’m presuming CFA lol) 6 hours without any break at all is unreasonable. A google search tells me VA doesn’t actually require meal breaks to be provided to anyone over 16 — it’s the employer’s choice. But still, a manager/employer who doesn’t allow their employee a break, especially in an environment like that, is straight up asking for mutiny and discontent. It’s legal, but an awful decision in terms of management as well as ethics.

It sucks, but its legal.

Unions need to union better and fight harder

Looking at the paper below that, it looks like it's the on campus eateries that you get in the Commons and so on.

“most customers and money on campus” is absolutely cfa in the commons

My friend is 17 and works at the chic fil a which I’m assuming is the unmentioned establishment here, going to ask them abt this like rn 😭

Who else is ready for the return to campus?

Honestly, who the hell would actually go back to class? Besides, half of the school is living outside of Richmond

Lmfao I can't imagine returning will go well

I hate to break it to you, but that thing wouldn't cut it in the virus labs. You're gonna want to upgrade to a Powered Air-Purifying Respirator (PAPR) at a minimum... ...on the plus side if things get dicey with the RPD again you should be good to go. Just remember to step into the shower to wash off the teargas with cold water before removing the mask. It should also be good for keeping the zombie blood out of your eyes with the full facemask, but make sure to pull the adjustment tabs evenly when putting on the mask; yours seems to be a little off...

I’m going back to in-person class on Thursday, buddy

Lol what. It's a P3 filter and is what is used in ebola outbreaks by the doctors. It's rated to 99.9999%+ of particles. For reference an N95 is only rated to filter 95% of particles.

Just giving ya a hard time ;) That CBRN is more then satisfactory for most chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear protection. There are a couple of things that they don't do well with, such as acid gases (I think they are good for about 30 min) and a few of the nastier chemical agents that the substrate can't filter out. The only reason mask/filter combos like that don't cut it in the infectious disease labs is OSHA generally require PAPR because they supply positive pressure to the mask. With positive pressure, that all but eliminates any potential of contaminates entering the mask if it is not fitted right by blowing air away from the user. I had to learn about all this crap some time ago and was well prepared when things went sideways last year as I had a bunch of Mine Safety Appliances (MSA) stuff (gave a bunch of it away too) Where did you get the Russian filter? I haven't seen one of those since my pop came back from a weapons' inspection and the Russians gave him a box as a souvenir...

I've honestly had this sitting around for so long I'm not even sure. But that's p cool to know about the positive pressure! I think my dad could have gotten it when he was in ukraine tbh

Word. The Russians made millions of those things during the cold war and while they technically have an expiration date, they really can last for decades. He told me what they did with the old ones is periodically grab several from a batch and test them, and if they passed simply recertify the lot. In case you don't know, the simple way to make sure the mask fits correctly is to put it on and cover the hole on the filter and breath in, holding a vacuum. If you hear or feel any air passing through or the vacuum breaks you have a leak and need to adjust the straps (unless it's somewhere else other than the face seal) If that's good then cover the exhalation valve and breath out, again if the pressure equalizes or you hear or feel something you need to adjust the mask. I tried to find the training video we had to use but it seems to have disappeared...

I didn't know that about the filters, so that's very neat!

Everything I Wish I Knew And Did During Undergrad at VCU After being a member on here for some time, and seeing a lot of the posts and comments on here, I wanted to share some things I’ve observed and reflected on during my time at VCU that might be beneficial to some of you just starting your college tenure. A lot of this pertains to life after college, and to maximize your earning potentials and job satisfaction later on in life, planning and preparation is so crucial (I really cannot stress this enough). 1) First and foremost, I don’t care what people say, GRADES MATTER! Not all employers ask for your gpa, but in my experience, the overwhelming majority do. Strive for a 3.3+. If you can get a 3.5+, the number of doors that open up to you can be incredible. There’s so much competition these days that even though employers know that gpa hardly means shit, they will still go for someone with a 3.5 over the 3.0 all else disregarded. 2) Get an internship ASAP! This means start looking your sophomore year at the latest. Your not screwed as a junior, but every subsequent year gets harder and harder. GO TO CAREER SERVICES AND ASK FOR JORGE PIOCUDA! He is one of the greatest assets VCU employs. Seriously! That man is amazing! Work on your resume with him, how to make yourself marketable even as an underclass, and how to write cover letters. 3) I’m a STEM student so this one might not be relevant to everyone, but for those of you in STEM, learn some technical skills! Obviously coding will be the main one for many of you. You should also be familiar with Excel (as well as most MS applications) and SQL..you’d be surprised at how many STEM related jobs utilize this tools and this can give you serious advantage if your moderately good with then. 4) Networking. The big one. This is arguably the most important aspect of college. So many people graduate and still have no clue what this means for a student. Well, it means going to class, forming relationship with your academic advisor and most importantly with your teachers! Form relationships with them! Ask for 1v1 meetings, do really well on your assignments, come prepared, ask questions in class, ask questions outside of class, and have them recognize you and your name! I’ve had professors reach out to me (and the entire class at times) with really cool job opportunities that I really wish I had capitalized on, but because I was a lazy shit, I knew they weren’t going to recommend me for that role. Fortunately I did get lucky, but please, get to know your professors. Go to career fairs! A lot of the jobs were kinda ehhh but speaking with some of the recruiters at the fair can open some really interesting opportunities. 5) Get involved on campus. Leadership position matter. Doesn’t matter what, employers want to see that your personable, you can manage, you can work within organizations, and are a natural leader. They eat that shit up. The more it pertains to your desired profession, even better—but not entirely necessary. If you can do all these things while in undergrad I promise your journey will be much easier. Ultimately, college is supposed to prepare you for the jobs you want when you graduate. Unfortunately, the job market is so oversaturated that more than a degree is necessary to get that job. If you want that job with a competitive salary in a great work environment, best believe you’ll need to work your ass off for it. Perfect that resume, build those connections, hone in on your interviewing skills and grab your career by the horns! Good luck guys!! Edit: Thanks for all the wonderful comments and inputs, guys! I hope for the best for all of you! Also, thank you to the kind person who gave me an award :) I’ve never gotten one before and it feels very nice! One last thing I wanted to mention, because it’s something I regret soooo much, if you get the opportunity to study abroad, take it! Some of my friends and siblings did, an d they say it’s one of the greatest experiences they’ve ever had. If you’re already paying tuition, it doesn’t cost much extra to do a semester abroad, and it can be a life changing experience. Also it can look really good on resumes as well :)

Quality post in general, regardless of school.

As a grad from 2011 and again in 2013, ditto on all of that advice. Especially the grades. Even if employers don’t care about grades (which I was told repeatedly as a marketing major), you never know what you will be doing 2, 3, 5, 7 years down the road. For example, I decided to go to med school and my 3.1 undergrad gpa made it infinitely harder. Let’s say you want to get a Master’s and even a PhD. You need the grades to get in!

Jorge Piocuda moved to UVA. He is an awesome dude and I am sure there are other great people at the Career Center but as of last year, he is no longer there.

I disagree with the high GPA matters thing, unless you have it that is amazing. But I don't think its the end all, be all. I don't want to be rude (this is coming from a stem major, and a 3.5+GPA), but don't beat yourself up, especially in this stressful time. People with a high GPA really see that benefit if they are pre-med, or applying to a competitive school after their bs degree (like PA school or grad programs in general). If you are entering the workforce after your degree, I doubt your GPA (unless extremely low/depends on major avg/job pool avg) will be the ultimate deciding factor in getting whatever position. Someone more well rounded, either with work experience/leadership skills/etc are not always someone with a high GPA. Tbh GPA is just a piece of the pie, many factors will be considered, I don't mean to be rude, this is coming from someone who ONLY obsessed over grades, I only learned the importance of networking and internships when I transfer to VCU (junior year). And I regret that maybe I was too overzealous about maintaining a high GPA is and the "importance" it has.

Was just gonna add Undergraduate research to the list: https://provost.vcu.edu/initiatives/urop/. Will make you a stronger applicant for grad/med school. Herb Hill is the director and is a good dude. His program assistant is great too, if you can’t meet with him.

I'd like to echo points 4 & 5. As a studyholic who got a 3.9 GPA, I've found that my lack of networking and internship experience really harmed my career opportunities. The 3.9 gpa is a great thing to fall back on, as I have an abundance of grad school options, and low-level administrative support jobs are easily impressed by it, but it alone won't get you that career job. Other insights I'd add: (1) get as fit as you can, (2) make sure you pick a job you want, not a major, (3) date and socialize as much as you can, it will never get easier than in college (dating in college is literally as easy as going up to any person you're interested in and starting a convo, or just sitting next to someone in class and asking to studying together), (4) take the best job opportunity you can find out of college, no matter where it takes you (within reason). Recruiters just love fresh college grads compared to 2-year seasoned workers.

Speaking from a School of Business/Finance perspective, this is a great list. Networking and getting involved are super important. The professors, especially some of the adjuncts, know people in the industry. If you can form a relationship with them and they think your smart/capable/etc they can connect you with people to get you the jobs you want. Getting involved is also a great place to make friends and network with other driven folks. These are people that are going to be pushing themselves, so having connections with these people is a great way to keep your career moving after you land that first job. Not to mention having lifelong friends is pretty dope too.

Great great great advice. I wasn't STEM, but I've worked in technical roles in manufacturing and now I do SaaS sales, and lemme tell you: SQL is fucking everywhere. Learn that shit and you will become an ASSET. Also, your LinkedIn profile MATTERS. Like a lot. So start meeting people if only enough to connect with them. LinkedIn is how I've landed decent interviews. And yes, my biggest regret was not doing an internship. Not doing that is what landed me in a shitty manufacturing supervisor gig my first year out of school. I didn't have any experience in an office setting.

Really good list. I can create a pretty good list of what not to do in university. The networking aspect is huge. At least making friend(s) with people who have similar career goals/pursuits as you. Don't be reclusive like I was and only worry about studying, working, and exercising. When you graduate and start to apply and interview for jobs it's so much harder to get interviews when you are viewed as almost a nobody.

Absolutely! Could not have said it better. You never know about grad school in the future, and it’s a very real possibility that you decide it’s worthwhile after you graduate or even further down the line when your employer is offering to pay for your graduate degree. Moreover, many of the reputable institutions have a hard gpa cutoff point, and they are not low to begin with.

Out of curiosity, how'd you end up in med school after studying marketing?

Oh man, that’s a shame! I hope the best for him though! Well at least it sounds like you utilized him while he was still there.

I agree with everything you wrote. Most, if not all forms of applications are reviewed holistically. That is, no single feature will make or break you, unless your on the extreme end of the spectrum (e.g. <2.0 gpa or invented Facebook). From my personal experience, about 30% of all the applications I thought about applying to/ or applied to, required a 3.0 minimum gpa. Some never stated, and I was asked during interviews (rare, but it happened). In the end, it matters a lot for some people, and less so for others. You don’t always know, until you’ve come out the other side of the process, so I advise making your life easier, and strive for a good gpa. So much less stress. The average application, IIRC, has about 200 applications. They will obviously choose the best fit, and the one with the best credentials (assuming your applying on LinkedIn, Indeed, Glassdoor, etc.). If your under a 3.0, getting a job without much else going for you will be extremely hard. Below that, and a non-stem degree? Very very hard. 100% agree with being well rounded. That was really the main heart of my tips. Work on making yourself employable. For example, an Econ major, with a 3.1 gpa, 1 summer internship, fluent in Spanish and English, some basic excel skills and no criminal background (and maybe a clean credit score) from an average school is a very well rounded candidate. A physical major with a 3.5 gpa and nothing else could very well struggle.

Excellent points. Thanks for commenting! I think having an extremely high gpa and nothing else to show can actually send the wrong message to potential employers (not saying that’s you). It’s so important to be well-rounded. As to your other point, yes! Enjoy your college experience. The next 4 years will fly by and you’ll be reminiscing over them. I know I am!

I’m glad you’ve recognized this! It’s probably even more crucial for business/finance majors. Good luck on your journey!

SQL and excel man, everything is run by data, so knowing these two will make you so marketable, and they’re not overly complex. I was going to mention LinkedIn as well, but decided not to write a book haha. I 100% agree with everything you’ve stated. Best of luck!

I kind of fell into Marketing when I was choosing a major. and I never really explored anything else because I was pretty good at it. Then one day I witnessed my coworker have a seizure, and I hated how I didn’t know what to do. I wanted a new challenge, and so I enrolled in a local EMT class and discovered just how much I loved Medicine. I finally knew what it meant to be passionate about something. (And I haven’t quite started yet - But I’m stoked to be starting this July!)

Cody Rogalski at the Career Center is also an amazing resource! That dude knows literally anything/everything about pre-health stuff!

Nope that's completely me. Some people are really impressed by it, others hold it against me. I'd be better of with more experience, and say a 3.5 GPA

Congrats, glad you've found your calling! As someone who went into college with no idea what he wanted to do in the future, I relate. I'm 24 and finally starting to experiment with long term career ambitions. Hoping I can get on the right track and have it figured out by 30.

Well I’m 31 if that helps, haha. I’ll be 40, 50, 60 eventually and night as well be doing what I love. Good luck!

To college students who are bashing service members; To my fellow students, It’s easy, especially in academic spaces, to view military service through the lens of policy critiques, imperialism, or historical injustice. These are valid and necessary conversations. But in the process, let’s not lose sight of the people behind the uniform—individuals who often come from working-class backgrounds, communities of color, or underserved areas. Many enlist not out of blind nationalism, but out of economic necessity, a desire to serve, or a hope for education and stability. Criticize the wars, challenge the policies, question the system—that’s our right and responsibility. But don’t dehumanize the individuals who bear the physical and emotional costs of those decisions. Veterans and active-duty service members are not monoliths; many return home disillusioned, become activists, or speak out against the very institutions they once served. They, too, deserve respect, support, and the freedom to be heard without being reduced to caricatures. You can oppose the war machine and still honor those who’ve walked through it.

![gif](giphy|MGmnFOZRFRo4w)

This reeks of ChatGPT

It's possible to support the troops while not supporting their mission.

I totally understand that there are broader systems at play. However, free will is a thing. If a military member is implicit in carrying out orders that further an authoritarian regime, I will not respect nor thank them.

We need to keep in mind that military service is often a last resort for working class students to get a higher education.

I think the issue is, our service members are in a voluntary positions (that now openly discriminates against LGBT). If they didn’t volunteer we wouldn’t have an army and wouldn’t be able to start wars or meddle in existing wars with other countries. On the other hand, the government could then try to force the population to go to war and made service personnel mandatory (except for LGBT hopefully). For that, I feel ambivalently thankful. I wish every country had the resolve to realize the general population greatly outnumbers the “leaders” in charge of their particular country and produces their heads on a stick until a leader is installed that doesn’t go to war. Ever.

war criminals

I think it’s possible to understand the military industrial complex as a net negative for everyone, and that can include those who enlist in service to escape poverty or acquire citizenship. No one should have to put their body or their life on the line for housing, employment, education, or opportunity. I feel for those who needed to enlist for those reasons and I don’t blame them for having done so. I blame the state that allows people within its borders to live in inhumane conditions such that they had to make such a decision. Not only does this nation allow people to live without the most basic of human needs, it puts trillions of dollars into running 100+ military bases in over 80 countries in order to maintain a chokehold over every lucrative natural resource and trade route. This “great country” is foaming at the mouth with money and it makes people give up their entire lives—their freedom, dare I say—so they might be able to go to college or be a citizen.

Veterans question the system all the time. We can be good Americans by questioning shitty status quo politics. That's what makes America great not the other slogan

I'm not honoring any arm of an imperialist machine. They deserve rights as humans, but I do not and will not respect or honor their service. Also, this is ChatGPT for sure.

https://girightshotline.org https://www.veteransforpeace.org

It’s hard to do what’s right, and for sure the unfairnesses and indignities of our society have made it drastically harder for some than for others. But it’s still fair to expect everyone to do what’s right. I’ll never begrudge someone for serving, and you’re 100% right that it’s a clear path out of bad life and the best opportunity for social mobility for many. But I will begrudge anyone who follows an illegal order, who follows an immoral order, or who allows themselves to be used as an instrumentality of the very oppression that they were trying to escape when they signed up.

Thanks for taking the time to write this out. I really appreciate the thought you put into it, and I wanted to share a few things I’ve been thinking about too. I’m not trying to argue just to argue — I’m genuinely curious about your take on some of this. 1. I totally get that a lot of people join the military out of economic necessity or to try and build a better life. I teach high school, and a number of my students have enlisted for those exact reasons. I respect that deeply. At the same time, I think there’s a difference between supporting veterans as human beings and unintentionally helping prop up the war machine. The military often uses those personal stories to paint itself in a heroic light — but those stories can be used to recruit more vulnerable people into a system that doesn’t always serve them well once they’re out. Supporting access to healthcare, education, housing — all of that is important. But I think we have to be honest about how often the *narrative* around “supporting the troops” gets used to silence critique. 2. I’m also struggling with the idea of separating policy critiques and historical injustice from the military itself. Like — how could we, really? Since WWII, the U.S. military has caused huge civilian death tolls in places like Vietnam and Iraq, overthrown democratically elected leaders, and left chaos in its wake (Grenada, Chile, Iran, etc.). A lot of times, it *is* the troops who carry those actions out, whether they agree with the mission or not. That doesn’t mean I blame every individual soldier — but we also can’t ignore the fact that they’re part of the force that carries out U.S. imperial policy. That’s a hard thing to contend with, but it feels important. As a domestic example, should we celebrate the US forces who opened fire on, and killed, student protestors at Kent State? Respectfully, I think the victims narrative is more relevant than the solder / guardsmen who was "only following orders/" So yeah, I guess I’m wondering — how do we support people who serve without reinforcing the system itself? And how do we stay honest about what the military does, without reducing everyone in uniform to a stereotype, good or bad? Would genuinely love to hear your thoughts on that.

Being allowed to stay and the ruling being overturned are two separate things the decision still stands until overturned it’s just not being enforced during the appeal please gain a basic understanding before commenting back

You’re right when the service member is pointing a loaded rifle at me, I should stop and think about their background and their dreams and aspirations

I think it's important to understand that not all military and vets support what is going on. There is a lot of people in the military who feel they are being used as pawns against the American people for one mans political gains. The military historically prefers to be non political. I think it's counterproductive to demonize service members. They know the situation is messed up too.

Homie, if these "service members" chose that life, then they chose the consequences. Don't hide behind a flag now, those people signed up to enforce violence, plain and simple. There is no pride in that, only shame. Flowery stupid words and begging for... what ever you are begging for is just plain sad. These evil systems of state violence would fall apart instantly if these deleted sociopaths quit their jobs. They chose that life, then they can live with the consequences.

When assuming things without doing research first can lead to a tragic outcome. Here is the US code of protection of federal employees and property. https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/2672

The war machine starts in the voting booth. The military is a tool of policy. The policy is a direct result of the people voting for representatives.

Fuck ALL militants.

The service members don't have a choice. This is their livelihood. As long as they aren't opening fire on civilians, a lot of them are going to do what they are told. Being a martyr will get them kicked out with a dishonorable discharge. If they are supporting families that isn't a feasible option.

People in the military are not more honorable or worthy of respect than anyone else.

“I made a choice to get free college in exchange for killing brown children and now people don’t like me.”

At this point, these soldiers and Marines should be joining the revolt against fascism and not just following orders. The way they just stood by and did nothing when Trump kicked out their trans comrades shows their cowardice.

Sure, but in the current climate to just be “following orders” as the government rips the constitution to pieces feels a bit complicit and complacent, no? You can be an activist while still within the military by choosing to not engage in actively attacking the freedoms promised to this countries citizens.

If you are willing to potentially kill for a paycheck you are morally repugnant

The military members today who were in position prior to the orange rapist felon, volunteered to serve. I am a veteran. My husband is a veteran. We have many members of our family who are veterans. I'm sure everyone reading this probably knows the veteran. One thing you have to remember is that they just cannot disobey an order given to them by their superior. I remember when my first husband was a soldier, he had a wife and family a baby. He couldn't just disobey an order and then be court-martialed. So many of these people are young and they enlisted when there was no war and they volunteered to protect our country. At any moment they could have to go to war so we need to support the service members. If you want to do something make sure you vote in the next election. You live in Virginia? We have our midterms in November 2026. We need you to get out there and vote because we're voting for our governor. Every member of the Senate and House in Virginia is up for reelection. You need to be active in the voting process because your vote is power. The people who voted for the orange felon and the people who did not vote for him all voted for him. Yes the people who did not vote, who did not think their country was important, voted for Trump indirectly. You need to take action and in fact on June 14th you can participate in a rally which there are about over 1,500 rallies to voice your opinion that you aren't happy with this Administration. Go to no kings.org and sign up for a rally near you on Saturday. So please stop bashing the military members who are protecting our country and protecting you.

I absolutely trust the Marine Corps more than cops to do what they're actually supposed to do, which is stand there and contain the protest to an area. If anything, that actually keeps protesters safer. How is that against US citizens?

Tell me what is a private in the Army going to do besides get an AR 15, extra duty without pay, and or kicked out with a dishonorable discharge? It starts from the top down, not bottom up.

These young Marines have been placed in an impossible position. It is DJT who deserves our wrath, not them. Edit: capital M

Lucky for you this hasn’t happened then, mr. Veteran

They’re not illegal orders

Not gonna lie. They had me in the first half

Why is that? I’d like to be better at noticing that.

agreed. perfect punctuation? from a vcu student? nah.

This. 👆👆 As the daughter of people who have had long military careers I understand that if you join the military you can't just quit because that's a crime. On the other hand it's not like the military, government, and politics have suddenly taken a hard authoritarian turn. If you've been paying attention during the first 18 years of your life then you know what it means to join in with this and choosing to do so makes you complicit.

Just because someone enacts policies you don’t like doesn’t make them authoritarian

Currently in the Army. If you try to openly discriminate anyone LGBT, you’d be hemmed up so faster than you can say LGBT. The army is very different from even just 10 years ago and they don’t fuck around with that stuff anymore. After Vanessa Guillen, a lot of things changed and sexual assault and discrimination started getting taken a lot more seriously. I’ve seen multiple commanders get fired or kicked out for just knowing about a situation and not saying anything. Also there will probably be a lot of service members at the various protests. You’d be surprised at the political leanings of a large portion of the military.

I agree, there is a big reason why people are calling for service members to “remember their oath.” I will never ever forgive or respect the service members who are currently stripping away innocent children and families away from their lives over being undocumented “criminals”, and then simultaneously forgive our president for having 34 felony charges and going above the constitution. A lot of service members who are doing this *are* immigrants themselves too, which is even more shocking and heinous to think that they’re doing this to their own communities. This isn’t the “land of the free” the people who immigrated into this country for the past 200 years were promised

Are you stupid? The fact that we have a volunteer military of this size is amazing when you think of all of the people who actually contribute to it’s operations and have decided that they will potentially sign away their life to defend your right to protest! The alternative is mandatory service, which would include members of the LGBT regardless because as a country and a world power our military is crucial. Screw your ambivalent thankfulness! yes there’s a ton of bad stuff going on right now but yelling at someone for doing their job isn’t the answer. Also, the idea of never going to war is idealism at its finest it’s important to accept that conflict in a global environment will always exist.

You weren’t here. It was peaceful. They they cut a line through our crowd, tossed tear gas and people started to panic. The music went off and they corralled us. The hour before curfew, they made a fully closed off perimeter crowd the crowd. The metros were closed and guarded with riot cops. The nearest bus station two miles away but again they fenced us in and wouldn’t let us in. I even saw a media personality ask a guy to pose on a car for a “riot” photo

The movement of the national guard has literally been found in courts to be illegal and control to be handed back today to ca

They don't like it but you're right. They literally haven't done shit but show up. No one wants them there, they don't want to be there, and everyone is being dramatic af about it. Besides what do these people actually want them to do? Disobey orders, get into a whole world of trouble making their lives infinitely harder so keyboard warriors won't get mad?

Nobody notices the professor's thick accent until after they fail the midterm. Nobody wants study material until the week of the exam. But they can bully the professor into giving them better grades. I kind of have a problem with that. I'm not sure how to feel about getting a curved grade. It highlights a double standard in this institution. During my first year I took an intersession course and went to the dean after a professor deducted points from one of my already graded assignments with the comment "A's in this class must be earned". The professor just didn't like me and had commented on my appearance multiple times. It was well-documented and I got an 89%, 'B' in the class, for no reason. This semester, our entire \*\*\*\* class failed the exam. I did badly on this exam too. It's kind of a bad class but it was outlined in the syllabus. (No one to blame but yourself). There's a lot of information that's not covered in his two-minute lecture videos. We use multiple textbooks. It requires more work from the students. I just watched students in this class not take notes; not study; cheat on their Homework; and then they cry to the dean after they failed. They didn't even have to cry with supporting documentation to prove that they worked hard in this class. Their engagement isn't being assessed like mine was. They didn't have to make a case. (and they really don't have one) Then, the professor just gives us all grades we didn't earn. (a 70-point curve) I'm in a groupchat with these people. I know how much nothing they did. The main complainers didn't even buy the book and their answer to everything is "I just looked it up on quizlet" or chatgpt Nobody notices the professor's thick accent until after they fail the midterm. Nobody wants study material until the week of the exam. But they can bully the professor into giving them better grades. I kind of have a problem with that.

If the entire class fails an exam then the professor failed you. This should reflect poorly on the professor and not the student.

Hold on. What FIRE class required a 70 point curve for you guys to pass?? I’ve never had a class with multiple textbooks in a FIRE class either? And I’ve NEVER heard of a professor retroactively lowering grades and making people “earn an A” like that? Jeez.

So the professor has a vested interest in the performance of their students because the grades reported and end of semester evaluations are looked at as part of their performance, and tied to their evaluations as employees and their compensation. It is not the first time a professor has changed a grade to keep their ratings up, and while I can understand your anger and I’m sorry about what happened to you if the entire class is failing there’s a likelihood that the professor is part of the equation.

Sadly this isn’t new, even before bell curve grading or sadly even in the workforce: favoritism and exploitation are abundant due to end stage capitalism. 20 years ago one of my best friends was being sexually assaulted (secretly and he didn’t tell anyone, this was before me too) by one of the best professors in the school who was grading based on who would put out for him. And there were others doing it too less under the radar because they were straight. This was the toxic art school culture at the Maryland Institute College of Art.

I had similar issues. I have accommodations but never had anyone to advocate for me when they weren't honored and my grade was dinged because I was in the hospital despite generally leading class discussions and the like, but people would regularly BS the classes and whine their way to a 4.0.

This isn’t a VCU problem, it’s an education issue

So you got a problem with your peers finessing the broken system because you had it harder finessing the broken system..

Supposedly some VCUArts professors did that, but I never really encountered it personally because I'm not particularly hot. But I have also had cases where my accommodations weren't honored and some professors really didn't want to actually teach, and they'd praise some people's work while ignoring cheaper but more technically proficient work.

deducting points from an already graded assignment just to make the grade lower is not the same thing as me failing an exam because I didn't do the work and then, me demanding a higher grade. It's a clear double standard.

Actually try engaging with the content before you complain that the content is too hard. I genuinely hope all the people who fuck around and cheat and use ai wind up unemployed like a lot of the people who graduated just before ai came out.

bruh what the fuck are you on? I never spoke about content being too hard 😂

Cheap over the counter supplies and medications Incase anyone didn't know student health offers over the counter medicine and supplies at a cheaper price than in stores.

Where’s the Percocet and Adderall on the list?

$2 sudafed…someones making meth out of their dorm

How do I get them? Do I have to go in person

cary street gym also has condom concierge that has condoms, dental dams, lube, all things safe sex for FREE

Wish I knew about these when I was there!

are these prices without insurance? just for being a vcu student?

Plan B is $6 on Amazon

Our tuition doubled and we all pay $500 for that service, which most of us don't need also, Ibuprofen is $2 at the grocery store. The $3 benadryl sounds like a deal until you see how many are in the pack

😂 Dream on.

PE is the watered down version that isn’t very effective. You have to show your ID to buy real Sudafed

Yes, you'll have to go in person to the student health clinic to get them.

Do you think they'll deliver them to you?

have to put in a little order on their online form

Yep, also last time I went to the student clinic they had a bowl of free condoms near the door not sure if they still have it or not.

Yes, its just for being a vcu student. Everyone whos a student pays for the student health in their tution so that's how the school is able to offer these discounted rates. The student health clinic doesn't take insurance.

Tuition was raised 2.7%. For those not mathematically inclined, 102.7% ≠ 200%. Also the free is $246 a year, not even half of $500.

May I know how to order

Tuition just doubled... If you read your VCU bill, you'll see that it's an extra $500 charge, if not more, and you likely already have insurance. So, you aren't saving any money.

I'm a senior. I have no financial aid. The 2 health fees together is $500. I've done the math a million times and I drafted the petition last year.

https://recwell.vcu.edu/thrive/condom-concierge/

What two health fees are you paying? Are you an MCV student or something? I’m only paying a single fee per semester of $123

There's an opt in and an automatic.

It’s truly impressive how much worse the new version of Degree Works is compared to the last version. Needed to get that off my chest.

I feel. The whole new banner system is shit in general. I miss week at a glance.

I’m convinced VCU has a policy somewhere that they can only do things that suck and make the student experience worse

i am currently completing both my undergrad and masters degree at vcu. with the new system degreeworks only displays my masters program requirements, so if i want to see what i still have left of my undergrad i have to go to the “what if” section ... so dumb

It’s so much harder to read too. It has a horrible layout and is just badly made.

btw theres no button to download a copy of it. If ur on mac you have to hit print, open it as a pdf, and then download that pdf. Who tf designed this shit lmao

I miss week at a glance

Advisor here. I absolutely hate the new version of both DegreeWorks and Banner (for course registration) and really miss the old versions. However, VCU doesn’t have control over whether their external venders choose to “update” their products, even if the updates end up being terrible. So this isn’t a case of VCU trying to make things annoying for everyone; this is happening because these companies that we are under contract with are releasing new (worse) versions of their products. For those of you not able to see secondary majors, etc. on the new DegreeWorks, this may just be a glitch (in which case your advisor can ask another office to attempt to fix it for you). Otherwise- especially if you are earning two completely different degrees (example 1- a B.S. in Chemistry and a B.F.A. in Comm Arts; example 2- a bachelor’s degree and a master’s degree)- you need to go to the drop down menu that says “Degree” (top right of your DegreeWorks page) and select your other degree in order to view it. If you are a double major but both degrees are the same type (example- B.S. in Chemisty and B.S. in Biology), you should be able to view both of your majors on the same page. If not, something is wrong and you should contact your advisor to troubleshoot.

It’s horrible

I like the college scheduler where you register for classes, but I don’t like the new version of degree works. I literally have no idea what I have left to do lol.

Cant see the reqs for my second degree and minor and STILL haven’t updated :( I sad

The old one was much easier to read, I agree

New version sucks on mobile too

What is this system? Is that the one that comes up when you try to register through Eservices now?

The interface kinda sucks and it’s somewhat slower for me

You guys sure pay a lot of money to attend an overprice book club when we could start a medieval town square for free😭 or if you more into the jungle we could give natives they land back 😁

You may want to talk to your advisor to see if this is normal if you are in an accelerated program. Sometimes this is a glitch that can be easily fixed by the degree audits office.

I just checked and was able to download a copy of a student’s DegreeWorks on my Mac (using Safari) by going to file- export as PDF.

I work for a higher ed tech company, and I've noticed that companies like Ellucian and Anthology (formerly CampusLabs) have actually been getting worse as they've grown over the past few years. I don't know why this is, and I wish we were a competitor to Ellucian so I could try to sell a better solution to VCU. But good god, I have gotten so many complaints about these companies during my conversations with schools recently. Degreeworks was the one piece of software at VCU that I actually loved, so of course they messed it up...

Someone above said they have to use the “what if” button . May work for u?

No. Go to eServices- Student- DegreeWorks 5. You should be using DegreeWorks to view your degree progress, see what classes you have remaining, etc. At the very least, you should be looking at DegreeWorks with your advisor during advising appointments. If you have never seen DegreeWorks before, I recommend that you meet with your advisor sometime very soon!

Possibly lol. To each their own tho

I don’t necessarily like it *better*, but I do like it and have no problems with it.

^^ listen to her apparently my brain doesn’t work

Yeah it is shocking to me that this new version of DegreeWorks was released to universities as it is now. Ellucian should be embarrassed.

It does but it’s annoying to have to go thru the whole process :( when vcu should’ve been responsible with their tech (that we also fund to an extent lmao). Thé what if is to see what would happen if you changed things sucks I have to use to be up to date with current things :(

Nice weather here on campus

College sucks rn, but we can do it!! Much love to everyone :)

I appreciate that!! Same to you :)

Trying to read my textbook for my psyc401 class currently 😅

Physiological Psychology? Girl, me too. I'm still in shock from that first exam.

I felt really good about the test but those short answer questions got me

A recommendation for the semester ahead. Shared from a faculty member who hopes that you all have a great (and safe) semester!

Thank you, Mr. Dogg

Hahaha i love this

Thank you snoop

I didn't feel disrupted during the peaceful protests, but I sure do now after seeing my friends beaten and arrested and tear gassed by police in full riot gear

Yeah, I was just quietly studying in the library until the cops came, that’s when my peace was disturbed

didn't feel disturbed during the peaceful protest until all the ESA sirens started and all the police in a 20 mile radius had their weewoos on making enough noise to wake a narcoleptic.

Congratulations to all the VCU seniors graduating today! I know it’s not what any of us imagined or wanted, but I’m proud of you for graduating. I’m hella proud and amazed that you finished up these final classes in the middle of a pandemic. Regardless of wither you’re watching the ceremonies or not, today is still your day. Try to treat yourself and practice a little bit of extra self love today. 💕🎓

Congratulations all!! 🎉🎉🎉

Great job everyone👏👏👏

PSA for incoming freshman and transfer students To all incoming freshman and transfer students, welcome to VCU. While we are excited to have you here, we just want to let you in on a couple things. VCU has some of the highest queer, trans, POC, Muslim, Jewish, disabled, neurodivergent, international, and first generation student and faculty populations in the state, and maybe even the country. We are defined by our diversity, we would not be VCU without it. If you are willing to embrace our diverse and inclusive culture, then we are excited to see you in the Fall. *However,* if people with the identities and backgrounds mentioned above make you uncomfortable in any way, then you have two options: 1. Learn to become accepting of those who are different from you 2. Withdraw your application from VCU No matter how you may feel or what the government might try to do to us, we are never going away, and we will never stop being proud of who we are. Period point blank. Thank you for reading this, and we look forward to welcoming you soon 💛

This was the biggest thing pulling me into attending this school!! Especially right now, a community of acceptance and diversity is a necessity. 💕

Happy to be apart of this vibrant campus! Love!!

So, you are open minded only to those who agree with you. All others are not welcome. Just like the “ closed minded” people you are trying to scare off from your school. College is meant to challenge all of you. And should teach you to get along, especially with those who disagree with your world view. But I guess not at VCU. The picture of hypocrisy.

We are known for diversity but we are still 50%+ white chat

Didn’t vcu fold under the Trump admin and got rid of dei?

I will always welcome different opinions other than mine, but hate is completely different. Hate is more than just “those who disagree with me,” hate is those who don’t see people like me as human. I have been told by many people that I’m going to hell, that I’m a p-do, and have been called a f*ggot all because of my identity. My life and the lives of others is something I will never allow to be questioned. VCU is one of the first places I’ve ever felt like I truly never have to worry about hiding anything about myself. I know that many can also relate…and I know there’s also people out there who want to take that away from all of us. That’s the reason why I made this post, and that’s also why I included the option to work towards becoming more accepting

People who are white can still be queer, neurodivergent, disabled etc. don’t immediately discount all of them

people when white people can still be minorities in other ways besides race

vcu *the school* did. this post applies to the student body and faculty

It’s been real y’all I finally graduated. It was hell, but I did it. Thank u to everyone in the subreddit for making it a great space to be in. I wish y’all all the best. GO RAMS!

Congrats! Is there any advice you wish you could have given yourself in your early years at VCU?

Did you enjoy commencement ? At all?

Go to class, don’t stay up to late, create a daily routine, don’t spend so much money, do yr homework, make as many connections as possible, invest in Bitcoin, etherium, dogecoin, amc and GameStop. A few other things as well, but I can’t think of them rn. Edit: do not buy cryptocurrency unless you have money to burn. Invest in low-cost index funds inside a Roth IRA, the crypto thing was a mistake, I’m not a financial advisor, please don’t sue me.

Seek your interests. Explore. If you’re having fun what you’re doing, you’ll find like-minded people eventually. Keep going. This applies for school and fun things to distract yourself with/sports/etc Socialize but keep a tight circle Find something to keep yourself busy physically, whether the gym or some sport

Go see the guidance counselor at your school/college and ask if you can take the strong interest inventory. It’s very enlightening!

I was asleep for the university wide commencement. I went to the Chs one at 6 pm. The novelty wore off after like 10 mins. I wasn’t prepared for when they called my name, but I saw some people one more time, and that was good. The moment we were proclaimed graduates was actually super anti-climactic, at least for me. I’m glad I went, but it was more of a chore than a special event for me.

This is really good advice, thank you!

That sounds like me : " i was asleep for the university wide commencement".

Lol I had a late night

Just learned some interesting history about the Altria Theater I wanted to share with y'all. It's not that important though. So first things first, if anyone has told you it used to be a mosque, they are wrong. It was built by a group of shriners (who don't have anything to do with islam) in 1927 and they called it "The Mosque" but it was never used for worship. They mainly used it as a theatre and a meeting place but it had all types of fun shit. A swimming pool, bowling alleys, pool tables, you name it they had it. Then in the 40's they had to sell if because it lost a lot of money due to the great depression. They sold it to the city for $200,000 when it cost them over $1.6 million to build it. Parts of it were used by the police. They used the lower floors as a police academy and even had a shooting range in it. During that time however, they still kept the name and continued to use it as an entertainment venue. They even had a rule where they couldn't use the firing range while a show was going on. It's worth mentioning that while film was shown in the theater it was mainly used for concerts and plays. It was so large and popular they had people like Elvis, Jimi Hendrix, and Frank Sinatra play in it. Then in 1994 its name was changed to Landmark Theater after a petition by a local muslim group who claimed the name "Mosque" was inappropriate for a place of entertainment. In 2014 after a $10 million renovation gift by the Altria Group, a tobacco corporation, it was renamed to... to... damn it I forgot what they renamed it to.

The reason it was referred to as "The Mosque," and still is by folks who have been around long enough, had to do with the architectural styles that were incorporated into it. From what I recall, the bath house that used to be where GRC is (the gray façade is still there) also incorporated a bunch of that style inside which was popular in the 1920's...

Actual Grateful Dead concert recorded there (also officially released as “Dave’s Picks Vol 1”) https://archive.org/details/gd77-05-25.sbd.shannon.13399.sbefail.shnf

Thanks for the fun facts!

Selected concert archives: https://www.concertarchives.org/venues/the-mosque

Lol who ever thought it was actually a mosque? People knew it was just a nickname

I remember sitting outside GRC and overhearing someone say "you know the theater used to be a mosque?" It made sense to me because it was next to a bunch of churches so why not a mosque too? Guess it was cap.

VCU should have a mandatory class called - How To Cross The Road.

He probably looked before crossing. It's a one way and not very large. If you don't see a car when you start crossing, unless someone is speeding heavily, no car will reach you before you reach the other side.

fun fact, Virginia is the first and so far the only state to decriminalize jaywalking.

If no car is coming then I’m crossing the street.

If there aren't any cars coming I don't see the problem tbh

Eh, at this point we’ve all done this. Is it right? No. Are they gonna listen? Probably not. Next time, just roll down… I mean, push the window button down & yell “GET OFF YOUR FUCKING PHONE & PAY ATTENTION YOU FUCKING PIECE OF SHIT WITH NO FUCKING CARE IN THE FUCKING WORLD OF WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON BESIDES YOUR STUPID FUCKING PHONE” and then to drive it home(no pun intended) a bit more, hold down your horn till they get annoyed 😎

I’d rather they have a mandatory how to cook class instead. Sick of these fire alarms

Yk, after hearing how my sister got hit by a car in the crosswalk down there last week, I'd imagine people would be like: "Aw fuck, time to pay attention to the street" But I guess not

What are you? the Crosswalk Commander?

Stop taking pictures of random people dumbfuck

Intresteing

who cares? as long its safe to cross its great im not from vcu but im city smart you need focus on those that live on their phones and listen to music not giving af whats going on around them muchless jay walkers

cross on the green, not in between. cross on the red & youre dead!

Nothing wrong with being an aware pedestrian. It's all the morons who don't even glance up for a second and cross right in front of traffic. Virginia severely fucked up by putting those "stop for pedestrians" signs at intersections. Like, yes, we all know. "Don't hit people" is driving 101.

Well, he's crossing Main Street which can be tricky. At that particular light (at Cherry), you can see Laurel turning red before the light at Cherry does. If there are no cars in the block between Laurel and Cherry, you're good and you'll get the signal in about 5 seconds. On the other hand, he is looking at his phone, so I'm not sure how attentive he is or if he's just following the guy ahead of him.

[Here's](https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe/?202+sum+HB5058) the law in case anyone was curious about this

theres no issue but sometimes i be driving coming a green light and ppl decide to walk anyways and i have to stop, then OTHER people decide to walk. then again I only lose like a few minutes max, but imagine if i was a distracted driver

any car with a decent suspension can go 70-80mph on those no problem

yeah, tell that to google maps, einstein

We're not saying different things. I'm just saying he probably looked before he crossed and saw that it was clear.

UNITE HERE hospitality workers at VCU win first contract! LOVE to see these benefits 💪💪💪

This is so rad!

Wonder what Rao's opinion of this development is

GOT ACCEPTED TO VCUARTS!!! Hopefully I’ll see you guys in the fall!

That's a huge accomplishment! VCUarts is a super tough program! Be proud of yourself and best of luck in the coming years!

Welcome in! I'm about to graduate but if you're interested in cartooning (your cartoon is really cute!) for the newspaper, shoot me a DM! :)

congrats!!!!

Congratulations!! I wish you luck this fall!

Congrats! My daughter is in her freshman year with VCUARTS. Huge accomplishment

Congrats! I’ll be finishing AFO this spring so if you have any questions/would like advice, please reach out!!

congrats!!! what program?

Great job! VCU is constantly rated as one of the top programs in the arts in the US. It is a lot of work but the payoff is worth it.

Did you post on the vcu2026 page?

Art foundations with plans to go into Kinetic Imaging!

No what’s that

It’s a Instagram page for upcoming VCU freshman to post a few pictures of themselves and leave a description of who they are as a person so they can get to know other people in their class and sometimes to find a roommate. It’s a cool page, it’s @vcu2026 on insta

Ah ok! I don’t use Instagram but thanks for telling me anyways, I’ll keep it in mind if I ever end up using it again

Strange things happening in Rhoads Hey there guys I have been loving my first year at VCU so far, even with all this COVID stuff going on, but as much as I love it there has been something strange going on in Rhoads and I was hoping other people have had similar experiences in this building and its not just me. It all started I think my first week here, I was finishing up some homework late into the night and I had to use the bathroom. As I went into the floor bathroom I could tell something was different. I just had a bad feeling but I had to get my business done so I could finish my homework for the night so I sucked it up and went into the stall anyways. I'd say about a minute in is when I felt it, a strange cupping sensation on my balls. It felt like they were being fondled by a ghost which is where I came up with the name for the ghost, the ball fondling ghost (because it fondles balls), I was so freaked out I pushed the last dookie out my ass and I rushed back to my dorm and didn't even bother to finish my homework because I was so freaked out by the whole experience. I thought it was a one time thing but this has happened about every 3 days or so and its really starting to freak me out. But also at the same time I appreciate the ball fondling ghost's company on these lonely COVID nights :( Anyways, I was hoping anyone else who lives or used to live in the building has had an encounter with the ball fondling ghost so I know it's not just in my head. I also would like to remain anonymous for

Is this a creative writing prompt or were you just bored out of your mind lmfao

Lived in Rhoads for a year and can’t confirm I was ever fondled by a ghost. Then again, I don’t have balls.

I wonder if the ball fondling ghost will fondle anyone’s balls, or maybe they only select certain people? I will go to Rhoads soon and test this, as I would love getting my balls fondled by the ball fondling ghost.

This is quality

Lived in Rhoads for a year, can’t say that my balls were tickled in the bathroom by a ghost but I can say that someone tickled their own balls a little too much in our shower stalls - god bless flip flops. Also once a month there was a trail of vomit from people’s rooms into the bathrooms. Don’t mean to hijack this thread, just felt the need to further emphasize the horrors that occurred in that dormitory.

you tellin me we got ball fondling ghosts now? 2020 wild fr

Lmao this might be a shit post, but I had to stay there during orientation for a night and me a my roommate heard a massive fucking thud come from the wooden closet thing at like 2am. Had to nope tf out of there for the night. But hey Maybe the ball fondler and the closet ghost are friends :)

A girl jumped out of the window of Rhoads in like ‘08, there’s something not right about that building.

Im alum class of '18 but my first year i stayed at rhoads and i swear to god i had some weird shit happen there too. i never told anyone but i was shitting in the floor 11 bathroom and i felt tingling by my taint and like 5 seconds later i came out of nowhere. has this happened again since last time??

What floor are you on? When I was a freshman I stayed in Rhoads and distinctly remember VCUPD gunned down this guy (I mean they really turned this guy into a pile of lead and blood) because he was going around all the male-floors in the dead of the night, and anyone who left their door unlocked he would sneak in and fondle their balls. Basically, after multiple consecutive nights of similar complaints VCUPD showed up and the guy ran out of the bathroom and made a mad rush for their balls and so they turned him into Swiss cheese. I wasn’t there for it but I definitely ran down to check it out after I heard all the shots. Some say his ghost still lingers in that bathroom, haunting Rhoads and fondling the balls of young men with very short cocks. Hope this helps, stay safe friend!

Consider yourself lucky. Since covid, I haven’t had my balls fondled in months. What floor were you on again 😈🤫?

Never had my balls tickled by a ghost lol, but I would have the hairs on my neck stand up like someone was breathing on me a few times & always felt like someone was watching me when I lived in Rhoads. My roommate was super religious so he misted the whole room with holy water when I told him & the next semester was straight. I used to fuck an RA there & she told me there’s been more than a few suicides in Brandt/Rhoads. There have been a shit ton in Johnson. I remember my freshman year some girl ODed on the patio and was dead by the time the ambulance showed up. Weird shit tbh.

I don't have balls to be fondled, but my door would constantly shake like someone was trying to open it, and would sometimes slam shut when I had it propped open. The elevators were wildly unpredictable as well, I was on the 18th floor and the amount of times it went all the way to the 17th just to go down... There was a girl on my floor that year who said she had a Confederate soldier following her around that she picked up off a battlefield and got possessed by for a bit. She proved it by holding a necklace still and asking questions, then clockwise would be one answer and counterclockwise another I think? So yeah. Richmond in general is haunted as fuck, though, I wouldn't worry about it too much except for maybe trying to get some sleep instead of being violated by the dead. Up to you, though.

Negative I'm alive and well in Tuckahoe.

God I wish I could encounter the ball fondling ghost 😔

More of a reason why I should take a gap semester before transferring

Also what floor is this on?

Lol is this fr?

Just wait till you hear what the ghost over in Johnson Hall fondles!

i mean im a girl so i cant help with this specific incident but when i lived in brandt last year i swear there was a ghost in my room. the main things it would do would be slamming the door closed randomly, and rifling through me and my roommates bag of plastic waterbottles that we would recycle (i thought it was just wind coming in from the windows or the air vents but it wasnt either, the bottles would just randomly start shuffling around in the bag like someone was moving them) but then when i went home for winter break it slowed down. my roomie never noticed. i miss my ghost friend.

I’ll trade ghosts with you, mine only changes the tv channels once in a while, zzzzzz.

No I swear it actually happened dude someone else commented that they experienced it too

I don't know I haven't asked my floormates yet because I am scared they'l think I am crazy

nasty, this makes me appreciate the suite life so much more

It was November 2009, right after everyone returned from Thanksgiving. I lived on the second floor at the time and she lived on the 17th I believe, and jumped on the side facing away from Franklin into the alley. Cops came onto our floor and were looking out of the window of a dorm that overlooked where she landed, and what we thought was a weed raid turned out to be a suicide.

The last time it happened was 2 nights ago but thats interesting, I guess it’s moved on from tickling taints to fondling balls what a strange ghost

Username checks out

I’m on floor 11 but I cant believe the ball fondler was a live person. He must be vengeful that his ball fondling came to a stop and now is taking it out on us poor freshman

#THIS IS AMERICA

Lmfao god I love freshmen. You are a a gem.

Is your name Zach, or perhaps Cody?

I remember that! I was on 11th floor that year. Do not remember a ball fondling ghost though...

Yeah it was really sad, she was in my good friend's focused inquiry class and all he could say about her was that she was always quiet. Don't struggle alone folks, adjusting to college is hard. Especially right now, so please speak with someone if you're having problems. I promise that we all did/do. And also, in a city as old as Richmond is, I don't think a ghost would be haunting a dorm built in the 1960s!

Why should Ghost only be from a certain time period? Where are the ghosts wailing “yolo” into the night?

Haha well considering the apartments and homes I've lived in here have all been between 80-140 years old and I've never experienced anything even slightly paranormal, you can count me as a total nonbeliever

got spiked and ra’s found out so i was at a house party. typically i just ask for soda and thats what they give me. yesterday I got spiked, i asked for sprite, had 2 cups. it tasted a bit bitter but not too much so didn’t think much of it. after 30 mins i began feeling incredibly lightheaded, dizzy, and nauseas. my vision began going out. my friends got me out of the house, and took me home. I live in vcu housing, and while going up the elevator, we ran into 2 ra’s. they came to our room to check in and make sure everything was fine. they took my name and v# and said they would be reporting it to upper housing. i’m really scared. i don’t want criminal charges or anything, especially since i wasn’t even trying to drink. does anyone know what would happen? edit- they didn’t call cops or do any tests so not sure how much/what i had okay so update as of oct 1- i initially had a meeting with the conduct office and they gave me 1yr disciplinary probation. a week later i got another email saying they wanted to talk again, and the charges had been dropped. basically they asked about the party, where it was, who threw it (rose club apparently). they said there’s not much they can do abt rose since they aren’t associated with vcu, but told me that they would keep what id said in their records and try to gain more info on rose but basically nothing they can do rn. anyways im good.

I think you should be more concerned about being drugged. If your friends had not been there (or worse, didn't take it seriously) who knows what would have happened. Sorry to sound like a parent but you should still consider getting drug tested to find out what it was.

Nothing bad is going to happen! reporting something doesn’t necessarily mean something bad is going to happen. RAs have to report if a resident seems under the influence of anything. what will most likely happen is you will have someone from conduct and care contact you and you’ll have to explain your situation. definitely get in contact with vcuPD about the spiking

Hey, i was a victim my freshman year, if you think you got spiked you need to report it, idk how long the drugs stay in the system but please at least start the paper trail incase someone else got spiked at the same party.

Do u think they meant they would be reporting getting roofied? Or they said specifically you drinking was the problem cause if so thats pretty petty of an RA theyre either a nark or a hypocrite

Reporting what happened to you could save your ass here. Go to campus police and file a report.

Hi, former VCU RA here. You should be fine. Freshmen are drunk and stoned all the time and, unless things have changed since I graduated, RAs couldn't give less of a shit. In your situation, it sounds like you were unable to get to your own room under your own power. That is probably why the on-duty RAs checked up on you. They are very aware that people get wasted. But there is a line. If I saw someone who looked spiked being escorted to a room, I would be concerned. As far as the report, RAs have to submit anything suspicious on-duty. If you mentioned being spiked, they can report it so that an investigation can occur to make sure that you are okay. They might ask what party it occurred at because it's very likely you weren't the only one that night.

Police have a policy where you won't get in trouble if you call and ask for help. You were drugged, you need to call them and make a report and let them know where you went. That's a horrible thing to do and they need to be charged for it.

BB I’m so sorry this happened to you. It’s so easy to feel like a criminal when you’re actually a victim and I hope you take it easy on yourself. You’ve done nothing wrong, and the people who did this to you are bad bad bad bad bad. There are plenty of resources available, both on campus and off, should you need or want to talk to someone. Sometimes it takes a couple days for all your feeling to get sorted, so try to allow yourself space.

You’re not gonna get charged with a crime. RAs have to report incidents in their hall for the safety of you and other students

Oh buddy. I’m so sorry this happened to you and I’m glad you have good friends that got you the hell out of that situation. You’re not going to get in trouble for anything. You have not done anything wrong. I️ hope they find the freak that pulled that shit on you

Was it a frat house or just some randos house party?

These are the types of friends u need to surround yourself with. Take care of each other. The world can be scary so make sure to continue to surround yourself with good people. I’m so glad you are safe and seem to be doing OK now. I understand the trauma and anxiety this may cause, but on a positive note - you had friends who looked out for u and got u home safe. Take care of yourself and those you care about! ❤️❤️❤️❤️ I am so sorry this happened to you, but I am wishing you all the best in the rest of college and hope you and all your friends and family stay safe! 💕

Your friends should have taken you to the hospital, I assume the campus has one, then called the local city police. That heavy breathing was a concern, that's not normal for being wasted. I work for University for 35 years here's some advice. Do not report it to the campus police, any kind of an assault and in this case I think you were drugged, it needs to be reported to the local police. Where I work the campus police were actually sworn officers to the town. They work for the University and the university will cover it up. Image is everything to the university, it's how they get donations, it's how they get students because it is a safe campus statistically, they will sell you out, for money. If the campus police are sworn officers they are the leads in the case, because you reported it to them first. As for the RAs forget about them, they have zero proof because no blood test was taken, as far as that concern, you could have eaten some bad clams, seafood that tasted funny, got sick felt dizzy starting to vomit. You're actually very lucky. You need to be careful don't trust anyone handing you an open drink. Oh, someone should have stayed with you during the night, people have died drugged and vomiting, not waking up.

Relax. You did nothing wrong. You were the victim here. And you have some solid friends to get you back safely. I’m not really one for calling the cops, but consider giving them the address of the party if they are possibly drugging women with something. Stay safe!

im really glad you’re safe u should be fine on the legal side but plzzzz go get checked for what drugs in your system. also who’s party was it? its better to spread the word if its a fraternity or something so people steer clear

The worse thing to do is say nothing and do nothing, you got away, how many before you didn't? Nail them to the wall and make sure that doesn't happen to anyone else. Cause the next person might not be so lucky and have to live with a life of trauma

VA amnesty law 🥰🥰

“Bro, believe me, I asked for soda and just thought it was store-brand and that’s why the taste was off” lol, you got drunk at a party, got caught by some RAs, it’s fine. Do the crime, pay the time!

u should be fine it happens all the time lol

This; they aren’t going to care about the rest.

Exactly. Nobody will be punished for being drugged… be honest and let those creeps be held accountable! Most colleges these days take these types of reports very seriously and the victims are able to remain anonymous (unless it’s like a situation that goes to court) … please be safe! I hope OP is doing ok ❤️‍🩹💕

they didn’t say anything. didn’t even ask if i was actually drunk. they just saw my breathing heavily and my friends helping me into the elevator.

It’s medical amnesty and PD will be most concerned about student welfare and need to know about a party where people were being drugged.

This is the VCU sub and you don’t know if there’s a hospital? Seriously? For the record, especially for any freshman on here, VCU PD are sworn law enforcement officers. If you call RPD they will send VCU PD the second they realize you’re on campus.

There is no lower form of existence than worrying about your permanent record. Mastering the fine art of giving zero Fs might not be a class you can sign up for as a freshman, but it is one you should go all in on as self study. Here is the other piece… You just survived a crime. It could have gone way worse for you. You might be thinking, “I’m not a snitch.” Here’s real talk. If they did it to you they’ve done it to others and will do it again. Some who do this are doing it with some very bad intent. Go on the record with the facts with VCUPD.

This victim blaming attitude is exactly why op is worried. I drink in private, but I refuse a sip of alcohol at parties or other outings. The environment gives me the buzz without any needed substance. House parties are commonly known for people getting roofied. That's why I stopped going and I only go to events at secure locations and only drink form sealed bottles. Op. My advice is to write down everything from that night down. Who gave you the drinks, what you were told was in them, how long you didnt have your sight on them, etc. And if they question you, do not let them pressure you into saying you did something you didnt. You went to a party off campus. Nothing wrong with that. You did NOT consume any substances. Nothing wrong with that. You were roofied or spiked without your consent. They cannot prove otherwise because you did not do otherwise. It will be a stressful few days I am sure, but you have the truth on your side and your friends can attest to that.

i’m scared it’s gonna end up on my permanent record and impact my ability to find opportunities in the future.

They were okay this time. What about the next? They should report it so it doesn’t happen again or to someone else

I'm wondering is RAs are mandatory reporters and obligated to report crimes against a victim.

Hello OP 👋 I totally understand the feeling of fear and anxiety. But if it is any sort of consolation; I promise you will not get in trouble if someone drugged you! Be honest about what happened - you had some soda and started feeling sick and roofie like symptoms. It’s not like you were smuggling drugs or alcohol into your dorm. Being incapacitated- even if someone wasn’t drugged - isn’t a reason to get in trouble. I am so sorry this happened to you. I am so happy you had friends with you to keep you safe and get you home!!!! Take care of yourself, I am rooting for you and wish you all the very best in the rest of college! Side note - those are good friends. Keep them around! Look after one another ❤️❤️❤️ sending love

I got caught up my freshman year for drinking in the dorms and possession (totally different scenario than what you’re describing). Went to court and everything. I had to do over a hundred hours of community service but the charges are off my record and nothing happened to me as far as housing at VCU went. I have a government job now. What I’m trying to say is, you’ll be fine. This will not impact you for future opportunities even if you get reported by your RA.

You’ll be alright, do you really think an employer is going to give a shit that you drank in college?!

I'm saying that they're not going to get in trouble what are u talking about

Yes, RAs are mandatory reporters. It sounds like the RAs that OP interacted with followed the correct reporting requirements

Remember when the VCU library was 24 hours.

It's a shame that they have not returned to 24 hours. It was a safe place for students to be at night if they needed it. VCU Endowmentis currently at $2.72 billion (2021) They can afford it.

I graduated spring 2020. I remember my friends and I used to pull all nighters in cabell and in the morning we would all take our Red Bull fueled walks to our finals. Strange to hear they haven’t made it 24 hours again. It was certainly a big resource for me and other students that didn’t have ideal housing situations for studying.

I graduated 2020, I can’t imagine I would have done as well as I did if the library closed.

yes it was so convenient especially bc i did most of my work at night. leaving at 2 really fucked me and my schedule up 🙃

MCV library closes at 5pm on fridays :(

I used to work the overnight shift at Cabell!

No. I worked there, as a student, in the 70s and we closed at 9.

I remember when it was open till midnight Sunday through Thursday. I wasn't around for the 24-hour era. Sounds lit.

I used to drive them to their overnight shift.

Well, back then the drinkin' age was 18, gas was like 50 cents a gallon, and you could get a 4-year degree for a few thousand dollars, so it was probably easier to go out and have a social life...

And minimum wage was $2. Man the education at VCU has really fallen off with this statement. It’s all relative. I never studied past 9, ever. You don’t retain 💩 at 2 in the morning amped up on Red Bull. Get better study habits, pay attention to what the prof emphasizes (cuz that’ll be on the test), and take good notes. Are you on the Deans list? I was on it for both undergrad and masters degree. Guess I’m just smarter than the boneheads giving me down votes.

Really? 4 down votes for an alumni?

Don't look at me, I knocked you back up from 5 ;)

Richmond boy starter kit.

bike should be fixed gear

Where’s the vape?

This is the “Richmond” boy but not from Richmond starter pack...is that scooter gang still out and about?

Damn dog, I grew up in Richmond. If this ain't the truth..

IMHO septum piercings are an archetypical female fashion accessory, much lesser so guys.

Gotta love it😌

Where’s the fanny pack?

no lies detected

Yeah, 21-speed is for the cool queer kids.

Nah nah nah. American Spirits, they’re natural my dude.

I wasn’t the original creator of this meme. But the person did forget to add that. Shame.

literally saw someone walking around with one in their hand haha

Scooter gang?

It’s pretty popular among both men and women. Source- am piercer

I’ve only seen one guy in Richmond wear a Fanny pack. At least on campus anyway.

I’d kill to see more though 😂

Go to any freshman dorm. There were a lot more in August/sept

If I knew any freshmen I would 😂

Wow So they really are expecting 4500 freshmen to just move in all in 1 day.

"We are happy to report that all buildings on both the Monroe Park and MCV Campuses have had their water restored (with the exception of the MCV Bookstore, as they are closed and would need to be on-site for us to enter). Again, please note that water is still not deemed safe for consumption; we strongly recommend that you place some sort of "Do not drink" signage on all faucets, drinking sources, and any items that may be utilized for consumption (i.e., refrigerators/ freezers, ice makers, etc.). Restrooms should be able to be used in the meantime." -- VCU Facilities Campus Coordinator

it’s honestly ridiculous and extremely incompetent of vcu

Move in? How much shit did you take home on break?

Just to note, I’m not complaining about the water problem, but more VCU’s handling of the return to campus. We originally were meant to have 3 days for all 4500 freshmen and additional upperclassmen to return to campus before classes start. That was sufficient time for everyone to get back to campus and settle down before the new semester. Now that’s been forced all into 1 day on Sunday, and with snow falling across the entire state, many people may have to drive through dangerous roads to return to campus. By forcing this instead of giving students an extra day to return, VCU puts students at risk during their return to campus and will also lead to a hectic move in day for students as everyone tries to move back into their dorms. That or many people may miss their first day or two of classes due to not having the time or good road conditions to make it.

Here was my professor’s disclaimer on our first class announcement for the semester lol https://preview.redd.it/0lvgps57vdce1.jpeg?width=1242&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c405f2b16bbf402c245ebf13d11c0dc9e5466050

Wondering what I’m meant to do as a commuter with a 10-5 schedule for water…. Go to 711 and buy bottles mid day?? Bring a ton of water bottles ??? This is only mildly horribly thought out by vcu

VCU moment 😍

This is terrible. Can’t shower and can’t boil water because my dorm doesn’t have a stove. I don’t know how the dining hall is going to function either and that’s where a lot of students eat at. I’m debating if I should wait to move in until water is restored but god I can’t afford to miss any class.

Considering the freshman don't even have stoves to boil the water, I hope they have thousands of cases of water to hand out smh or the boil advisory is lifted.

It's a fact...but as I walk around campus I see loads of water bottles year-round. This too shall pass.

Was I hallucinating all the pallets of water being delivered to campus?

Is this from Rao?

They should not be open if the water is still not safe. This seems reckless

That's normal of VCU.

This implies that you expected a sane competent response? If so, please lower ones expectations

It actually has nothing to do with VCU. It was a city-wide issue. Be informed rather than inflamed! Students for the most part are coming back to a normal situation, so don’t make it worse by complaining about things you weren’t here for.

Enough to survive a month, which granted wasn’t that much but 4500 in a single day is still diabolical

Lmfao, at times like these you kind of have to laugh. Glad to see they're in good spirits

The city (and Henrico) already passed the first of two water tests. Just waiting on results of the second text tomorrow.

water pressure is back and it's showerable, just not consumable! we also just passed the first water test, thankfully. I've been washing my face/neck with bottled or boiled water to avoid potentially drinking any while in the shower.

By Sunday the water should be fine. Don’t hold your breath on that but maybe VCU got assurance from the city that the 2nd test should pass?

Is the water not safe? Thought boil was gone

Water is okay, but they still need to flush out things like the water fountains and such. Main issue is VCU moving everyone in on a single day on a delayed schedule and not giving people an extra day or two to move in.

You weren’t hallucinating. There have been some students on campus all week (international students, those who didn’t leave for break) plus they had to provide water for the essential personnel who had to work anyway. The real struggle here was for the hospital employees who had to try to give medical care with no running water for days. We’re out of the woods now.

From one of my professors

hello old friend

omg we found rao's alternate account lmfao. As someone who lives here, I think it's so valid for VCU students to complain. VCU should have pushed back classes starting by at least a day to ensure clean water in its dormitory and campus facilities. no one is blaming VCU for the water issues, they're blaming VCU for a lack of responsibility during the crisis regarding the next semester from what I'm reading.

I live in richmond dipshit

It’s safe now, at the time of my comment it wasn’t yet. VCU’s instagram has a checklist of things to do for your dorm / apartment to flush the bad water out.

Suddenly Shirley.

As seen on r/pics

Ive always wondered why didnt VCU take such a statue down to begin with when they renovated monroe park. Really goes against the whole idea of being a diversity driven university. Did they not have a right to do so, or were they just like "fuck it, leave the Confederate statue up."

I would assume that VCU would not have been able to get it taken down considering it’s owned by the city of Richmond, which has been focusing solely on revamping and conserving Monroe park. Although VCU is slowly swallowing Richmond, they still would have to either: A: ask the city nicely to take it down (no way in hell that was gonna happen) Or B: buy Monroe park and take it down themselves (the city ain’t giving up MP to VCU) That statue (and probably every other confederate statue in Richmond) causes VCU to get a shit ton of flak, I bet.

You know the feeling

This sub was dead for years till yall zoomer asses got sent home

For realsies?

I've been a proud follower and occasional contributor for years. Your hating isn't welcome here.

Not hating, this sub was dead af before now

I’ve always thought this was a surprisingly active sub. A lot more so than some other I’m in

If dead is at least one new post a day...

Can confirm. I’m the guy with the white beard.

ANTHONY HOPKINS?! ;)

W Marshall st

ALWAYS lock your car. A 24/7 dash cam also great. There is no reason to not lock your car. Cars get stolen in Richmond ALL THE TIME. this is not an exaggeration. Happens all over the city. Less in well lit areas but still happens.

Shit like this is why I be locking my door 10 times when I leave the car

Unfortunate but normal occurrence in richmond v.v

He needs to pull on a door and somebody punch him in the face

Surely u called the cops and didn’t just take a video and post it on Reddit, right? 😭

What a nice southern gentleman! Confirming all his neighbors cars are well locked before he himself can retire to the comfort of his boudoir and relax for the night!

He’s just making sure you guys locked ur car what’s the problem

Man, back in the 2010s, my car was broken into on Marshall St overnight. They stole my toll money and my Kenwood CD player, wire harness and all. Makes me sad to see this is still an issue.

I mean, who doesn't lock their car?

You need to forward this to VCUpd and hopefully you called them before taking this lmao

Literally my street and I recognize all these cars dude, I hate it here so much

I'm sure he is just locking the vehicles he finds that are unlocked

His buddy lent him his keys without telling him which ones his car, now he has try keyless entry for all of them

When I watch videos like this, it makes me reminisce about places that I didn’t see or hear about this happening.

I lived on W marshall when I was a student and this doesn’t surprise me

You couldn’t yell at him at least?

What a jerk

BB gun from the upstairs window…

You should have popped him

what a loser

He's just making sure everyone locked their doors.

The community should work together by taking shifts to sit in the backseat of a car with tinted windows (back door unlocked) and as soon as the would-be thief opens it, have a shotgun aimed at him and yelling, "RUN SQUIRREL!" No bullets or anything (idea isn't to shoot him), just the gun so it scares the shit out of him. After a couple of times, he'll avoid that area like the plague.

This would be the same view from a nice Scope on a AR too . He’d have 8th grade graduation pics on the news fucking with my shit .

I would have yelled out “I SEEEEE YEWWWW” and hid.

get a secondary car alarm and a dash cam, there's a few that are loud as fuck. i bike but keep a very loud whistle on me and a bike alarm in case someone tries to steal it, that may be a second (and cheaper) option for if you see someone trying.

just got an email about a car stolen from e marshall

I would have lit him up with my paintball gun.

Richmond is a cesspool of criminal activity. Riots were crazy during the whole crybaby 2018-2019 period

Looks like Arlington VA

What a fairy.

People who don't lock their cars deserve to get robbed. Entitled.

I’ve had windows broken in, now I leave it open with nothing to steal. There have been times where I could tell someone’s been in the glove box but nothing taken lol.

Sadly, he might get someone killed. Just saying criminals don’t follow the law. I wouldn’t expect them not to have at least an illegal gun. The lifestyle goes hand and hand with potential violence.

Both are equally a waste of time

Could have at least yelled at the fucker. You’re on the second floor. He can’t touch you. Bystander effect to the fullest.

I’m sorry. Don’t hate it! I’m a mom, and your comment 💔. There are a lot of advantages to a big school in the middle of the city. Just be safe when you’re out and avoid walking alone after dark.

I made a similar joke. 🤣

I made a joke about him just making sure that everyone locked their doors. 🤣

Seriously. This is the way in some areas. They really don’t mess with anything and you don’t need a new window. Plus side.. every once in a while you walk into an active soup kitchen w/ Mikey and the boys.

Or he might get him self killed

Very true.. not much will be done though. This issue seems like something Richmond accepts. It’s really the poor and the students who get the worse of it. However, I don’t hear the outrage.

Good, one less shitty person wasting oxygen. He’s not doing it because he’s starving. Zero sympathy.

Play stupid games win stupid prizes. Go around and be a criminal and you’re asking for some serious violence to come your way

imagine being stupid enough to try to fight or kill someone because your dumbass forgot to lock your own car door. I guess you keep your life savings in gold bars in plain sight in your vehicle. couldnt me be

What?? Are you saying that we should just assume that crimes should happen to us at any given time? I live in Iowa. My grill sits in my carport along with my air compressor bikes and Kayak. My doors are unlocked in both my house and car. In the 7 years I’ve lived here, in a town called Spirit Lake I’ve NEVER had anything stolen. I could not imagine your mentality. That’s the same mentality saying if a girl dresses all skimpy she deserves to be raped. Wow your city must suck. Leave your car door unlocked you deserve to have shit stolen. Your girls dresses all skimpy she deserves to be raped. Wowowowowow

Can someone explain to me how they think a student who is about to graduate is going to drop $650 on a wooden chair with a VCU logo on it?

I think it’s meant to be a graduation gift from a parent/grandparent. I’d be offended if they bought me this old ass looking chair instead of just giving me $650 tho

Can i trade swipes for it

What? You already are $20,000+ dollars in debt when you graduate, why not spare another $650 so you can sit down and think about how the hell you're going to pay it all back. Sounds pretty big brain to me.

Damn that’s kinda cool. Just steal one from hibbs lol

Buy any chair and print out a logo and glue it on that chair.

Lmaoooo where is this from?

Close to 700 with shipping

My grandpa has a chair like this from Harvard, which I thought was pretty cool. I don't think VCU has the same effect...

Wealthy parents/grandparents buy the chairs for the graduates. And then the money goes to - fucking somewhere.

It's really just a chair with the logo on it hahah What a waste of money!

Trust. Fund. Babies.

I could definitely see some nova kid's WASP parents/grandparents buying this

Its for your parents not you

Do we really need a post bitching about every little thing? Edit: No one is forcing you to buy a damn chair. Just like nobody forced you to buy a class ring, a degree frame, or to even attend college for that matter.

Not to mention it's ugly AF.

Nova and Short Pump kids got those parents/grandparents with big warchests to play around with

I know someone who was gifted this for graduation because their father received the exact same chair when he graduated. Father was super proud to buy it and he was rolling his eyes. It currently sits in storage. Different school though. I'd really like to see where it's "handcrafted." It would be cool at least if it actually was handcrafted start to finish.

Maybe the real degree is the friends we made along the way

whats WASP?

Aww yes my parents will want to buy a chair to remember that $60,000 libral arts degree!

ATTETION ---VCU ALERT Shooting CORE MP Campus-- Monroe Park. Go/Stay indoors. Avoid area. Police on scene. Shots Fired CORE MP Campus -- Monroe Park. avoid area. VCU Police on scene. " Heavy police presence reported" *Photos off social media not mine*

More information: deceased - 18-year-old male and a 36-year-old male 31-year-old shooting victim - life-threatening gunshot wounds Four shooting victims - non-life-threatening injuries a 14-year-old male, a 32-year-old male, a 55-year-old male, and a 58-year-old male nine-year-old child hit by a car https://www.wtvr.com/news/local-news/altria-theater-graduation-shooting-june-6-2023

At least 20 shots fired, maybe more. Response was fast but shooting lasted less than 30 seconds.

Lt. Governor Winsome Earle-Sears (R - Virginia) said the gun violence in Richmond was not about law-abiding gun owners, but rather gangs. "Even if you took all the guns off the street, from the law-abiding citizens, the others who mean harm, who mean to kill and mayhem, they're going to have the guns," she said. "So we have to figure out what's going on in our communities. We have to find the right problem, so that we can come to the right solution." Didn’t even wait until the body was cold to get in front of the gun control narrative… I got this from the article linked in this post.

Shooting at Altria theater during an RPS high school graduation ceremony https://www.wtvr.com/news/local-news/altria-theater-graduation-shooting-june-6-2023

This is awful.

Oh my god I hope everyone is ok

What angers me the most is how little I know VCU, Richmond, and our country as a whole will do about this. Rao will send out an email wishing “thoughts and prayers” and nothing more, and the city, state, and federal governments will just call the event an “uncontrollable tragedy.” Our livelihoods have never mattered in their eyes, yet we’re the one facing the consequences for their actions. It’s gonna take more than “thoughts and prayers,” we need protests, petitions, calls for resignation, whatever it takes so that those in power can finally listen to us, and so that something as horrible as this can never ever happen again

GD. This is infuriating.

Crazy how things are getting in VA

Why am I just now getting an app alert for this post u/reddit? Jesus, talk about alarming.

why are you posting old stuff?! 🙄

Just got this alert and it was alarming. Wth.

There were no school shootings during Covid maybe schools are the problem not guns

Infuriating. Especially because so many of the headline mass shootings recently have been perpetuated by people who legally bought their guns in the weeks leading up to the shooting.

Its weird because no one has ever threatened to take all guns away from anyone. Ever. Its not even a real threat. And republicans say this every day.

Rao sent out a goddamn email about the fucking budget 3 hours after this event. That guy can get fucked.

THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS! AND PRAYERS AND THOUGHTS! https://youtube.com/shorts/AHfgzAgjJzQ

You know a lot of deals are made? I know the UVA shooter got a deal. https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/14/us/university-of-virginia-shooting-suspect/index.html Maybe we could fully enforce the laws we actually have.

Did this happen in a gun free zone? https://www.rva.gov/press-releases-and-announcements/news/firearms-prohibited-city-facilities-parks

I think you misspelled United States...

Me too, I continue to get alerts. Including at 11pm last night, on a holiday. I wish there was a clear way to report issues to Reddit.

Unless it was a shotgun or rifle the gun was illegally acquired. Shooter was 19. Edit: but yes it is misleading but not all mass shootings obtained firearms legally. In this case it isn’t looking like the kid had legally purchased the gun. As the shooting lasted I think less than 30 seconds and tons of shots fired. A shotgun holds 3 rounds and takes a few seconds to reload

10 people were injured in total, 2 fatal. Source: https://www.wtvr.com/news/local-news/altria-theater-graduation-shooting-june-6-2023

They said it was auto scheduled but they couldn't at least stop it?!

No literally. I saw the news, I checked my VCU email, just due to the budget we need to make cuts. And then an apology email for sending the budget email. Like what? Then barely any email. And barely any action taken about the shooting inside gateway! And no email about the RamRide driver pulling a gun on a pedestrian!!! Like what the fuck?

Idk what shotguns you know buddy but they can definitely hold 5-8 shells and actually I’m pretty sure the shotguns with an actual magazine go well beyond that. I agree though the 19 year old should not have had a handgun unless it was bought legally and given to him but I really don’t think that was the case

Yeah I was just working the ED and had 4 victims come in and heard some info from the doctors about fatalities. This was early on before official new was released

The apology email was also sent by is office, not by him, which also doesn't look good. Like, he's supposed to be the VCU community leader and all he sees in his community is dollar signs. And says that required state salary increases are the reason VCU will operate at a deficit, when he accepted an 8% raise last year, bumping him to $700k. So, yeah, he can get rightly fucked. I did not hear anything about those other two things - a shooting inside gateway and a ramsafe driver pulling a gun? What! That's crazy.

It’s the ones my dad use to hunt ducks with. When he’d let me shoot it it only would hold 3 rounds

Yes! A few weeks ago an employee shot another employee in the gateway hospital! Then the RamRide driver had no reports. I only knew about it bc I just happened to be walking out of CHOR when it happened. Shit is crazy here!

You have to plug shotguns while hunting migratory birds and limit them to 3 shells, most shotguns hold 5 shells, one in the chamber and 4 in the magazine tube.

Why I haven't been doing the covid numbers recently. If y'all haven't noticed, I have not been posting any updates regarding vcu's covid numbers recently. Honestly, I just got sick of it. As people did point out, unlike the first few weeks when we got here, not much has happened recently so I really could not think of any substantial things to add to the update daily. This made my updates a bit stale. Not to mention, some people seemed to dislike me posting in the first place for that exact reason. As such, I really don't wanna do the updates anymore. If anyone wants to do it themselves, feel free. All I ask is that you allow the comments to be a place where people can talk about their ideas about what is going on. On a final, positive note: we finally have the amount of tests VCU is doing and has done. I sincerely thank all of you who sent emails to get that added, you've done a great deal for us rams :). I'd consider my purpose in posting the updates to be fulfilled and my main goal of getting the actual numbers up done. I couldn't have done it without you guys; Thank You 😁. Vcu Covid Dashboard: https://together.vcu.edu/dashboard/

Hey thanks for putting up the updates. I know some people didn't like them as you mentioned; however, I really appreciated what you did. Thanks.

Thank you FishFingerLover. You had a great run

Thank you for your service

I liked reading your daily COVID updates. I never checked the dashboard and didn't even know it existed until you started posting. People need to stop being so sensitive about it. They could have just bypassed the post if they didn't want to read it. But I guess that would have been too hard.

Gotta say I really loved your daily updates, as I go on Reddit everyday, but would never go out of my way to check the COVID stats. It’s unfortunate that the vocal minority got too loud about this as I’m sure most people appreciated it. These daily threads sparked a lot of activity which the sub doesn’t normally see often. Thank you for your service

I enjoyed your post homie! It was a nice breath of fresh air! Thank you so much!

Taking credit, so admirable.

You are very welcome. I'm glad to hear someone liked the updates.

Some of them were right in saying that the posts were not covering anything new. I will give them that. I don't think it was to the level of spam, but still. I included a link to the covid dash at the bottom of this post here for y'all to bookmark. Who knows, someone may take my mantle in the future. _/\•_•/\_

I think this is a spammer. I don't even know who this person is.

May I ask what prompted this response 😅?

I think you might be right on this one, they've only been active on reddit 9 days or so.

Its pretty annoying. This happened on a completely different VCU post with a completely different username. I don't even know how to get away from it. Not even sure why they would even troll like that.

I'm not saying that at all 😅, it's just that this post had nothing to do with your girlfriend.

But, ya did.

god bless you poor incoming freshman I just wanted to say that I have no idea how you guys are figuring this out. Moving in and adjusting to college is hard enough without a literal pandemic going on. I wish you all the best of luck despite the crazy circumstances and I hope you get to enjoy VCU.

Plus the fact they paid cash for a “online orientation”. You incoming lot, whether freshman or transfer, stay safe. Be patient and (hopefully) at some point things will get better. Keep your head up.

Thank you very much :,) As an incoming freshman, I really appreciate this. I don’t know what to think of this upcoming school year and can’t help but to think this is somehow unfair to us and everyone else because how poorly the government handled this pandemic. But I have three in-person classes so I guess that is what keeps me excited for college right now. Hopefully I’ll be able to make friends too.

It’s so hard :( i feel like i’m going to have such a hard time adjusting and social gatherings would have taken my mind off of home:/ also how am i going to make friends besides my roommate???

Vcu is straight up insane to make people pay real money for that. Plus it makes me a little sad because I met a lot of my current friends through the meet and greets there and I assume the online orientation didn’t have much of that

I hope so too! My best advice would be to keep a good attitude. I know it seems like everything sucks right now but just know there’s so much to look forward to. Plus from my experience online learning can be kinda fun, especially in smaller classes where it’s easy to make friends :)

Well one way I did was through a discord chat. Some students have them and they usually have tons of members with similar interests. I don’t know if clubs or anything will be online too but that’s also an option. I get that its super tough though, but I hope for the best for you :)

And vcu apparently isnt letting people into other dorms besides their own dorm. It would suck for people with a girlfriend or boyfriend cause they will prob try to sneak them into the dorm somehow

The city is great and you can go out around the city to make friends. I'm directly from Richmond so I know the place well. DM and I'd be happy to tell you more about the city and stuff to do and just be a friend

Yeah there was almost none of that

I second this! I've seen a decent amount of clubs have discord servers to chat in :)

My orentation group is pretty fun, we've done get to know you type things. I've been enjoying it. Take advantage of all the fun events orentation is hosting

Its worth a shot to get more involved, but holy shit was it awkward. Our orientation leader made us play a "choose an object in your room with the first letter as your name" game then at the end of the hour he said "I'm so glad I met you all, all of you are my friends now" even though almost nobody talked the whole time lmao, I know VCU is trying their best but bruh

Oh? I did that too XD what's your name what if you're in my group XD

You said "he" but could have been typo - is your OL male or female

Its a he. Idk the name, all I know is that was a transfer student orientation

Oh okay XD I have a girl. But yeah we did that game too. But for real the orentation events going on, we watched Chicken Little XD there was a game night, I didn't do that one but yeah

LMFAO chicken little that's actually pretty fun ngl

Happy Pride Month! Double rainbow spanning the entire VCU campus from Gladding to Siegel

it makes a pretty awesome [dual monitor background](https://imgur.com/a/fHhyqER). mind if I use the pic?

That's fantastic! I may be able to furnish a higher resolution copy. There's another version where rainbow is more vivid but double rainbow not as visible.

oh I’d definitely be interested to see those, please let me know if you do get the higher res copy cause i would love to use it :)

only VCU students would be protesting Mr. Krabs

Krusty Krab is unfair. Mr. Krabs is in there, standing at the concession, plotting﻿ his oppression

probably some frat bros doing a hazing thing

Lmao it’s from the show. They’re copying it. It’s a joke.

I love how this isn’t even the first or second time I’ve seen Krusty Krab protests there

I’m in class... what are they saying?

Pretty sure this is a lambda chi “hazing” thing. A kid I know had to do it last year.

Is anyone else just absolutely mentally checked out? Nothing matters anymore lol just let me take my finals so I can go home.

Yes. I am so tired.

Writing this from my math class that I didn’t even bring my bag to.

Even though I did enjoy my time off, I believe the long Thanksgiving break has made people unmotivated or maladjusted returning back to classes. I much preferred having the reading days/fall break that occurred during midterms last Fall over a longer Thanksgiving break. Hang in there!

I have fallen asleep in my class at least 3 times now. I just want to nap :(

"Does anyone else breathe air?" ... Yes its naptime.

Guy next to me in my fluids class had a panic attack the second exams were passed out and he froze and didn't write anything for an hour and a half ... Smart guy too ...

This gives me the big chest pain

Feel ya man, you’re not alone. Had two projects and have barely any done; I’m a worthless shit. I feel as if I get a lot more work done during the busy school week with all the pressure on me.

I've got a lab practical on tuesday and havent studied a thing 😭 praying I can learn four orders in two days

You picked some of the best buildings around campus to shoot! Beautiful.

This is amazing! Really captures the city!

Absolutely gorgeous photos!

Thank you, and I agree! The older buildings are much prettier than the new ones in my opinion.

Thank you so much!

Bed bugs at Cabell??? Was studying at the library yesterday and this morning I took out my notebook and this fell out of it. It’s been on my backpack since yesterday so I don’t think it’s from my dorm.

REPORT IT TO THE LIBRARIANS!!! You need to let them know so they can get rid of them. Cabell had this issue a while ago. Iirc, the bugs were in the booths on the 2nd floor last time. Also, report it to your RA in case they traveled to the dorm.

Report this to facilities via the housing portal. Get the people in adjoining rooms to report it too. Don't try to spray on your own. Put all of your bedding in the dryer and BAKE it on high heat. Bake it before you wash it.

Hi, u/plum_sss ! I'm Laura Gariepy, one of the Associate Deans at Cabell Library. Could you please reach out to me directly so I can get a detailed report from you so we can determine next steps? (804) 828-8562 or [lwgariepy@vcu.edu](mailto:lwgariepy@vcu.edu). Our understanding is that you did not see a bedbug or evidence of a bedbug in the building, which is what triggers an inspection. Bedbugs are sneaky critters and it might have slipped into your backpack anywhere. But we'd like to get an official report from you to make sure, and take note of what dorm you're in, too. Thanks!

Not **again**

I wasn’t sure if anyone reported so I just called and let the librarians know. Bed bugs are a really big deal! They are now aware

https://preview.redd.it/e4qfvpoorlod1.png?width=567&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fe7359fa8b815e0b1171f58c8d217c379e0bf584 Oh that sure looks like one... report it..

Report ASAP. please confirm you’ve done so (otherwise I’ll be afraid to go pick up books…)

I’m in the library rn itching just looking at it 😰

Cabell has a lonnnnnnnnnnng history of having bedbugs throughout the years. Before covid, the library would shut down certain parts on a regular or just completely bc of bed bugs. They redid the furniture recently bc of it. Since then I haven’t heard much about them but seems like they’re back again

Oh no! I’m in the library every day!

What floor and what section?

fork found in kitchen

I’d suggest buying some diatomaceous earth and going scorched earth on your whole room/dorm. Bake all your clothes/ sheets in the dryer anything fabric goes into the dryer at the highest setting and put diatomaceous earth in every corner and along the walls

bed bugs at cabell reoccur every year bro 😭 i been here since 2018. once u report it though they are pretty quick at taking care of the problem

If you have one, you have them all.

They get them every year

I swear this happens every year, thought bed bugs at Cabell were part of VCU’s starter pack?

Oh hell naw! Ive gotten bed bugs because i let a friend sleep over years ago that went to vcu now i go to vcu and i live in the library so excuse me as i remove my skin and throw it away

how is this happening

That looks like a tick

Looks more like a bat bug. Super similar to bed bugs in looks. Bed bugs are much smaller than people realize even a full grown adult. They’re more reddish in color too than dark. Fingers crossed

Vcu is nasty asf, I’m glad I didn’t end up going there, let alone living there💀 I’ll never forget having to use a dorm bathroom while dating someone there, worse than a McDonald’s public restroom. Roaches and ants crawling around, floor sticky a glazed with piss so bad you can smell it from the hall way Vcu staff needs to step up, yall don’t deserve to be living like this.

That doesn't look like a bedbug. Their legs aren't that prominent and they're more reddish brown. It might be a tic or a beetle.

> REPORT IT TO THE LIBRARIANS! Sorry, my daughter was a commuter and I forgot Cabell is the library, not a dorm. Good guidance.

I’m scratching just looking at it

I must stress the importance of high heat first. Water will not kill bed bugs. It may just knock them off so they remain (alive) in the washer. Heat is one of the few things that can kill bed bugs. There are sprays, but that takes a while to kill the bugs and should not be used on its own.

Y’all itch’n…

A mod here: I have pinned your comment and sent a message in mod mail.

Jeez.. is it just people bringing bedbugs from their house or something? That’s scary.

2nd floor near the computers

Holy shit! Was it spooning with the knife?

Happened a few years back

Bro idek people be dirty

Tell fucking everyone at York. This isn't a joke. This is a fucking nightmare in the making.

Do squirrels eat bed bugs? I thought they had no natural predator. But if you want to keep a squirrel army nearby to combat bedbugs, then please let me know. We can film their antics and make a fortune on social media!

So you're saying to just bring squirrels into the dorm and library? How many is enough? I'm assuming just grab some from outside. I love this plan

oh hell nah 😂😂😂😂😂😂

And years before that too smh

Was about to start going more often too.. now I’m scurred

I recall this from around 2017-ish

And 2019/2020

I mean you can and should definitely still go. No need to be scared. It’s just more of a conscious thing being mindful where you sit and put your stuff. Personally I don’t really like laying my stuff down on the floor or get too comfortable in any upholstered chairs. And when I come home I don’t like my outside clothes on my bed or couch esp after a day at the library. The lib is where I spend most of my time. Students should definitely use it. It’s just the mindfulness that it’s still a PUBLIC space that is used often.

If their sacrifice will bring an end to this scourge, then they shall gladly feast upon these enemies!

Hey everyone, I lost my dog the other day at Texas beach and I’m really worried about him. Please keep an eye out for him, and if you see him please let me know! His name is Reggie and if you call his name and don’t run after him he’ll most likely come to you. Please spread the word!!!

Uploaded on all my instagram account stories to spread the word. I really hope you find him!!!!!

Reggie has been found! Thanks to everyone who got the word out!

Was he wearing a collar?

OMG, I'm so sorry! I'd be frantic. I hope you find him!

Reggie looks so sweet. Uploading to my Instagram. I hope you can find him

Shared to my Insta!

Same here, there’s few things worse than losing a dog. I really hope Reggie gets found and reunited with his loving person!

Yes and he’s microchipped

Thank you for this kindness! You’re a wonderful person! ❤️☀️

Anyone else feeling disillusioned? With the current political climate and how the Government is seeming to destroy federal jobs, I've started to feel like everything I've worked towards these past 3 years is for nothing. Does anyone else feel this way in the Wilder School? Idk this piled on top of being a student who relies on financial aid, I feel very hopeless.

you aren’t alone, there are similar feelings in STEM, especially biomedical research.

They did this to make you feel hopeless. Your best act of resistance is to not feel how they want you to.

It’s an understandable feeling. You’ve worked hard for this and now thanks to some idiots, your path could be in jeopardy. What you need to do is stay the course, keep your eyes peeled, and wait. And wherever you CAN get in for the time being, go there. That’s the best advice I can give you. I actually had planned on looking at greater opportunities now that I made it a year at my current position in local government before this mess. But I’m still going to rework my resume and test the waters just to see what happens even if I don’t move.

I just signed up for FEMA Corps. I'm probably about to be screwed by the current administration. I don't get financial aid. I'm actually paying for this crappy education. I know how you feel. We are not paying for an education we are paying for status.

Definitely. I just switched over to homeland security & emergency prep and intend to keep going with it as I think it’s a very useful field, I’m worried there will be no FEMA/similar agencies to work for. Honestly though I think that makes us all the more important, less people are going to be preparing to go into these fields if there’s nothing to go into, but it’s still so needed.

I hear you. I graduated during the height of unemployment back in 2010-2012 era. That was a rough time bc mid level employees were taking all the entry level jobs. It was next to impossible to get hired so a lot of us got masters degrees. it's ok you're feeling nervous, it's completely rational to feel that way right now. Federal funding trickles down to non profits, universities, consulting firms, etc and so many other employers that many might not realize. I work for the state in Medicaid and we've even gotten nervous. Do you know what you're interested in? What cause and what sector?

I finished my undergraduate in Dec 2007. I understand this feeling. You’re going to be fine.

I feel very worried as a special education major, what will happen to my job and my students? I don’t know how to help either which is even more frustrating

Don’t feel hopeless, that’s the goal, but remember that the skills you learn are not only applicable to your field of study. Most people never work in their fields of study, and even more move onto different fields with similar applications. This is unfortunately a part of life and a good life skill to develop, how to market your abilities to a role. You aren’t just capable of solving the equation, you are capable of doing complex math. You don’t just know about environmental policy or public health, you are good at documents and extracting and communicating the requirements. We still need people like you and your peers to do all the important work that every engineer I know couldn’t manager or stomach to do.

3 years? Hell dude, some of us have 20+ years sunk into careers that are just evaporating before our eyes. If this goes south, you can pivot. You’re young, you’re smart, you’ve got this man. It’s a shitty time, but all in all, you’re in a great position to adapt to that. Wish us old fucks luck though, because if this shit keeps going the way it is, we’re fucked.

Parent of a VCU student but also a post grad ME. The week the first DOGE shutdown started, there were 3 pages of "job offering canceled" emails. Line after line. That's very disheartening. My brother works as a computer scientist in a high security DOD facility. He's been getting the "don't you want to resign" emails. Every day. That's very disheartening. What they both still have, at least for now, are jobs in their STEM fields that support them. They have their education. They have their achievements. They have the ability to diversify. Life will throw curve balls, and most paths to success are not linear. When the time comes, get the internships to gain experience (paid or not). Go to the job fairs and hand out your resume. Private industry is always looking for STEM professionals. It's the experience you have to bring to the table. Getting experience can be slow, messy, boring, challenging, satisfying, surprising or exciting. It's all those things. Put your energy into your passion, and search until you find the thing for you. It might be one thing or 20 things. Be adaptable, flexible and always seek more knowledge. It will be ok!

I totally hear you. Environmental Studies major over here…pretty concerning. Just hoping that things get better in time. Although I am certain the worst is yet to come.

Yea these days things suck. My job sucks. Just got to keep your head up

Let’s start calling these policies, plans, and actions what they are: ANTI-constitutional. They don’t care about the constitution. They want to destroy it. Unconstitutional makes it sound like it’s a mistake. But it’s deliberate. I’m a linguist, words are power

I feel the same way. However, don’t you think that this is a tactic? I mean people like to project things that is what is wrong with them. Don’t listen to this hater. He’s poking us and laughing. Ignore him. Not worth the conversation. The rest of us are feeling it. They are probably is some child with no job. The point is. That person is irrelevant. There will be people out there just trying to poke the bear. Stay in your line of work. We have people in the right places doing what is right. We picked these fields because we see a future in them. Don’t give up because some people want to change that. If we struggle with the funds, let’s find a way to make those funds. We are s a community. Let’s not give up on ours! We believe in what we choose as a field of study. Let’s not let uneducated haters make us feel bad. They hate us because they are uneducated. Just laugh it off. We got this. You all are smart people. Haters are going to hate. Things will get better. Believe in the fight.

Oil pipeline workers, coal miners, and refinery workers felt the same way you do when Obama and Biden systematically and outright eliminated their livelihoods. They had to find new ways to survive. Your side lost the election this time. Why do feel so entitled to a life without difficulty? Move on.

It’s gonna be ok. VCU won’t even get you a job. You will need to do multiple degrees. Good luck

Touch grass

If we have too many federal employees than is needed to get a job done, then we need to cut the waste. Among all the great federal employees we do have, there are as many and possibly more that are mediocre performers. Spend a few months in the military, as an example, and it is very obvious.

Americans put too much emphasis on politics. There’s companies everywhere that are hiring. It’s just difficult to get a job with little to no experience. That is your battle. How can I prove my worth so that I can get hired. The jobs are out there. Private and public.. nothing last forever. The same way things change under Trump; they will change under whoever is next.. the only thing no one can’t take away from you is your education, skills, abilities, or talents. I have faith you will do well!

Lol go be a CO at a prison, they need employees. Use that degree. Stop being a baby. College is a joke and money pit. Hard labor jobs!

Thank God other people realized you're wasting their time and tax dollars, get a real job instead of scamming your way into one through government over reach and brainwashing

Well, if you can't compete why waste tax dollars on it?

They are doing this to cut unnecessary govt spending. “Doing this to make you feel hopeless” get outta here with that nonsense.

I'm interested in the Intelligence sector 🫠

Go private or go home, anarcho capitalism for the win

Dude college has gotta way worse since then, they might as well be voting for kamala or Obama with their time and other people's money

At least you can go international.

There shouldn't be "sides" in America. We are all Americans, why are you so set on pitting us against one another? It wasn't Obama and Biden who ended coal mining, it was the companies. Don't come and try to lecture me on hard labor when I've worked it. Also don't try to lecture and pit me against the two major industries of where I came from. I am Appalachian and both put food on my table growing up. I went to get the education I am to help the people of where I'm from, not continue their suffering. Individuals like YOU are what is wrong with this Country.

You’re an asshat!

Probably would've worked out for you if you focused more on academics rather than tugging on your ween in an attempt to make it bigger.

My degree isn't suited towards corrections. I've also worked hard labor jobs and went back to school to provide myself a better life as well as provide for my family. Maybe instead of viewing everyone in the same boat as ane enemy, gain some empathy and realize we're all in this together.

Just because you work a hard labor job doesn't mean that hard labor jobs are better than white collar jobs

Why are you here? You have no idea what you're talking about and regurgitating absolute crap.

Go ahead and come comment on your actual account. Own what you say with your chest.

Are your comments on here an excercise in agitation

Overreach is one word in American English.

Take some deep breaths

Who's getting tax dollars? I don't get any financial aid.

According to your post history you're the guy who gives people spare change on campus. You said you give close to 20% of your paycheck away. You're wasting more of your money on VCU students than the government would through taxes. Not to mention that you're apparently pro-KKK and pro-fascism. Your beliefs are honestly just confusing and you seem unwell.

it has nothing to do with competing, i have had multiple projects funded and grants awarded. Not pressed about that, and the order doesn’t reduce the number of awards. what concerns me is those awards also paid for electricity to the lab, shipping of materials between labs, janitorial services for the building the lab was in, journal subscriptions to keep up with current research, maintenance on boilers for autoclaves, travel to present research, and ethics and hazardous waste training. All of those are indirect costs and without that research will not be able to move as quickly as it has.

It’s always a throw away account that does nothing but show up in spaces they don’t belong just to be contrarian out of malice. GFY.

Oh if you truly believe that you are extremely gullible. This isn't left vs right it's up vs down and you have corrupted millionaires and the richest tech autocrat in the world digging his hands in United States government that he has effectively BOUGHT. You can't seriously be that naive.

If they were worried about government spending, they'd look at how much taxpayer money Trump's Superbowl visit cost.

Please, live in reality.

Oh I don't have too much info for you with that sector. I wish I could help more! I'm not sure if this is similar to my field but my only advice is to ask how the position you're interviewing for is funded. For me (public health) you can ask how much the job is grant funded/federally funded. You would want to accept the jobs that have less of that. I hope someone else responds who knows your sector better!

What were they protesting in the original picture?

This template is amazing lol

Doesn’t Rao get paid a $1M salary? It’s not even a VCU problem it’s just a school problem in the US. It’s fucking ridiculous the school administration gets paid so much fucking money in this country. $500k salary for the top leadership in schools is pretty reasonable and it’s incredible that our tuition is funding some millionaire.

I'm not gonna share the kids name because he doesn't deserve the time of day, but he's a person with some obvious problems in his life, this day he was at the compass with a message including the n-word on his poster, and he did it to get attention. That cop had to stand by him to protect him from getting his ass kicked until eventually he did something that crossed the line of peaceful 'protest' and got taken away by vcu police. The dude has claimed to be a vcu dropout, is a frequent poster in the VCU class of 2020 facebook group where he posts provacative, sexist, racist, alt-right type shit

it was something racist, idr what

The dude is just an annoying racist dude to tries to provoke kids at the Uni to fight him, which is unfortunately a bait people are willing to take, which is why police is there to ensure the only thing exchanged is words. I haven't seen or heard from him around town, likely since there isn't anyone to piss off right now. Probably would be the same if people just ignored his ass even during normal operations.

What’s great to think about is for every firector or figure head for any department making an outrageous amount of money there’s at least 1-2 people directly under them making something similar. Sure vcu was nice to go to but higher education used to be just school and not a resort you went to for 4 years

There were a bunch of things, but he threatened to be a school shooter at one point on his now-deleted Youtube channel.

The second highest paid salary in VCU is making around 400k I believe. All their salaries are made public. I agree university is a resort compared to education in prior years but anyone can agree that an $1M salary for a public state school employee is outrageous.

My mom tried to say that was a reasonable salary cause of all his responsibilities. What??

For my trans pals. Don't freak out about the VCU Hospital announcement. Planned Parenthood has your back. They're on the bus line.

Is anybody else really struggling with their classes I feel like all I’m doing in my free time is reading and studying and doing homework and I’m still falling behind and struggling to get decent grades. I’m just starting to feel depressed and unmotivated.

Feel like I’m not learning a thing and just making sure to have assignments submitted by 11:59pm or 8am

I feel ya, in the same boat but gotta keep going

I keep telling myself this is test to my tenacity of my student career. But also fuck this semester. Suffer some, it's almost October.

Same here like at first this was nice, when it first started. till it got worse and worse as months went a long. Like i literally wanna drop out and do something else, school isn't even catching my attention anymore, i keep trying to convince myself to do the work, but it's usually half assed and last minute when i turn it in, cause like my bed is in the same room with me and tbh only time i willingly leave it is to get food or go to work. I think i got so used to doing homework in the library between classes when covid first started, that doing it at home and being here all the time sucks. Then going somewhere else to do homework is out of the question cause I'm unmotivated asl rn and still fearful of Covid cause older parents. Then though I don't like being around others much, i miss seeing so many people motivated to come to class or library that were around my age at VCU (pre-Covid times). I don't even play videogames any more literally only thing i do is lay down watch youtube, vape, drink sometimes, and text my friends. Feels like only enjoyment of my days, cause i got so used being at home now, then my gf never wanting to hang out anymore then breaking up with me didn't help either, seeing her on the dating apps randomly annoying me further.

I’m doing great and managing my time well, it’s just that the motivation to do stuff is pretty much gone when you’ve pretty much been on spring break since March and jobless/furloughed and you’re still accustomed to the “wake up at any time and just play games or other hobbies all day” lifestyle.

If you’re having trouble keeping track of classes, I recently downloaded “calendars” on my iPhone and it’s been a life saver. I have all of my class due dates color coordinated on it and it also sends notifications when stuff is due.

I feel it big time, I’ve been losing interest in my major over the past year and a half. This semester has hit the nail on the head. Not one of my classes has actually peaked my interest since freshman year. I want to drop out and do something completely different because this college life is not for me. It literally feels like it will kill me if I don’t change something soon.

Make sure you schedule some time to relax. Literally schedule your time to relax and play or you'll sweat about studying all the time

I feel you on that man it's hard to keep up with classes that I like and don't like and ik deep down I might have to readjust my gym time just for the sake of busting my ass for the first year but I don't think it's worth it

I can relate. Since all my classes are online, it feels like x2 the homework, since you have to make sure to watch all the recorded lectures. It’s hard for me to focus while watching those.

I’m struggling to do coursework at all. So many missed assignments already. It doesn’t help that I don’t like my major but I can’t even go to bars or join some clubs to take my mind off that.

I'm doing badass because of one thing: Recorded lectures. I can review the lectures as many times as I want from the comfort of my own home. I can take efficient notes without feeling rushed. Motivation can be an issue - it's a little hard to hit the books in your underwear when you could be playing Dark Souls. But I get through it. Whatever you do, get over the depression hump. That WILL turn out to be a cyclic spiral and you will crash and burn. Learned that the hard way last year.

I feel you in just laying down and texting

I just feel like my brain sometimes doesn’t want to retain any information no matter how much I read or study

Are you me? I hate mine so fucking much.

im so glad im not alone in this, the only reason im still taking classes this semester is bc i’ll have enough to just minor in my current studies and then switch majors

I’m with you, it’s just so hard to catch up once you start to fall behind especially if you don’t have any motivation. I’m just trying to push through it and grind at the work but it’s hard stay motivated when your stuck inside the same room all day

Hi doing badass because one thing: Recorded lectures, I'm Dad👨

i’ve just accepted that im not gonna learn anything this semester, and frankly idec anymore. all my tests are open book anyway who why spend even more time trying to study

I’m like 95% ready to drop out, move to the country side with my partner, and start a bee farm with a mushroom farm on the side lol.

Oh my god. I look at photos of beautiful places on Pinterest. I’ve been daydreaming of floating on the water in a clear blue lake in the mountains for the last week. I can’t even swim.

Bruh, there’s a twitter account that films VCU students in the restrooms.

Hopefully someone can report this to the school.

Omg they have 16k followers?? Super creepy account.

Most of the videos are filmed at the library. A lot of them are just of guys using the bathroom without their knowledge or consent. I made the Library and it’s dean aware of this account this morning (I write the newsletters for the lib). They said they’ll send maintenance to fix any glory holes & will send the account to VCUPD to see if they can identify or stop the person running this account. Honestly though, VCUPD could give a fuck about sex crimes on campus, so who knows what will happen. Y’all stay safe out here

That's an incredible way to end up with a broken nose

They have a “backup” account too, same @ but with a 2 at the end

Wtf I’m reporting all of this. This is beyond disrespectful. How can 16.7k people think this is an ok thing to do???

Worse yet, they're actively profiting from others' being spied on in glory holes. That's not just a dick move, but dangerous as fuck.

This is sooo gross... Reported :/

This is absolutely disgusting and such an invasion of privacy!! How is it still running. It’s even worse that this guy has a justforfans. I can only hope he isn’t selling videos of other people without their consent or knowledge, but unfortunately I wouldn’t be surprised given this account.

What the actual fuck

this is disgusting. people in compsci — see if any white hat hackers in the are willing to try and trace the phone operating the account and then hand over that info to VCUPD

I really want to report this but dont know whom to forward information to...

Just did that

Just reported it with the form someone linked. This is fucking disgusting

Yeah, I’m not a VCU student but I thought I’d share this here.

they could be fake (bought) followers to make it seem like they have a large following

This is what I used: [https://police.vcu.edu/services/report\_crime.html](https://police.vcu.edu/services/report_crime.html)

Thank you so much

Thank you, gonna use this as well.

What category of crime is this under?

You are welcome!

I think Peeping Tom or Obscene Material/ Pornography

I lost my emotional support shark Hey guys, I know this sounds sounds stupid and trivial, but I lost my emotional support shark, Phineas. I might have left him in my therapy room, but if anyone finds him let me know. Edit: Nvm someone took him and didn't even turn him in to the front desk (WGN). If you're the person that has him and I see you with him, I want him back.

Fuck whoever stole phineas. Return him

Good luck and best wishes getting him back! To the person who took him: you will get yours.

omg were you in wgn last time you had it? im pretty sure i saw something that looked like that on the floor by the entrance earlier but idk if its there anymore

Phineas looks awesome and I hope you can get him back.

Thanks, I hope so too, but I doubt it. I got this from an artist so maybe I can just get another one? Idk I miss my emotional support shark though :(

ugh i should’ve given it to the front desk 😞 i hope you find it somehow!

I didn't, someone just took him. Thanks for telling me though

VCU Minecraft server I’m working on making a vcu minecraft server just thought I would tease it here

That's pretty cool :D

yayyyy :DDD

i will be there

Lemme in gang

Had to take a break for it

100 pieces of candid advice about VCU, college, & life from an alumni who had to learn the hard way **Preface** I graduated in the late 2010s. I have a younger family member going to VCU soon, so I decided to write up advice for him that I ended up just making general advice for anyone coming here. I thought it’d be a good idea to post them here in case they can add any value to any current/future student's lives. This post isn’t a victory lap about how I succeeded in college, it’s lots of hard lessons I learned as a first-generation college student who had no role model for how to set myself up to achieve long-run success during college, and despite having good intentions ended up making a lot of bad decisions that led to (currently) having a mediocre career, limited social life, and poor mental/physical health. I also learned a lot from watching the successes and failures of my friends. Posting in the hopes that people who read this don’t make the same mistakes and be stuck in their mid/late 20s having to put their life together (it’s so much harder now than it is in college when you actually have free time). I’m sure some of the points will be universally agreeable, and others will be hotly debated. This is just my very biased point of view, take everything with a grain of salt, and take in the opinions of others with an open ear. I felt writing this really gave me a lot of closure surrounding the lingering regret I had from my college days. I hope you all enjoy reading it as much as I did writing it. **Health/Mindset** 1. Mental health is the most important thing. Fix it ASAP. University Counseling Services is a great resource (might’ve saved my life when I was having a panic attack my junior year), make use of it. Don’t be ashamed to get therapy, it’s literally the best thing you can do for yourself. 2. Physical health is a close second. Cary Street Gym is amazing (the indoor track is goated). Find a buddy and start hitting the gym. Focus on cardio and calorie counting if you are overweight, focus on weight lifting and refining your diet if you’re normal size/skinny. I can not stress to you enough how difficult physical health is to fix once you’ve got a 40-hour-a-week job, make use of your abundance of free time in college to form long-term gym and eating habits. 3. Your mindset should be that you’re here to meet as many people as possible and take advantage of the 4 most fun and social years of your life. Your routine should be very public. You don’t meet people or get opportunities chilling in your dorm with one friend playing games all day. Studying at the library will get you more opportunities than studying at the dorm. Hell watching Netflix in the Commons will get you more social opportunities than watching it in your dorm. Getting out the house is a must. 4. Actively seek discomfort, it’s the only way you grow. 5. Challenge the beliefs your parents instilled in you. I came into college a Conservative Christian sexist/basically incel who loved conspiracy theories and racist jokes. I left a Liberal-leaning person questioning his religion, with more classy interests and a respect for women. Not saying become a liberal atheist, I’m saying challenge your beliefs to see if you actually believe them. I built my whole social life in college around being Christian and it had profound social ramifications on me when I started to question my faith… my college experience would’ve been so much more congruent with who I am if I had come to these conclusions my Freshman year rather than my Senior year. 6. Delete your video games during the semester. People who level up online don’t level up irl. 7. If college feels easy for you (it did for me), you aren’t challenging yourself enough and need to add on things **Choosing a major/career** 8. Evaluate if college is even the right path for you. It’s expensive and time-consuming, and you do not want to go to school and drown yourself in debt and not get a job making enough to pay it off. Ask yourself what sort of job/life you want and if college can realistically get you that. Ask if that dream job pays well enough to reach your long-term lifestyle goal. DO NOT come to college if you have no specific answer to the question: “what’s your goal in coming to college?” And the answer can’t be “I’m just figuring it”… go figure yourself out somewhere you aren’t going into massive debt and come to college when you do (if that’s the right path). 9. It’s completely ok to put off college for a few years after high school to soul search. Coming in with the right major/career path in mind will make the time off worthwhile. 10. Have an idea what job you want to get with your major. I used to say “pick a job, not a major” but I actually prefer to advise picking between a shortlist of majors with good stats and then back engineering that to a job. The exception being if you have a very strong passion for a certain career path and the academic strength and discipline to distinguish yourself in that path. 11. Ideally, study a Technology, Engineering, or Math major if you are capable. These are far and away the best majors for long-term financial success and work-life balance. Not all these degrees are created equally either, I know BME for example is generally pretty bad for an engineering major. 12. Finance/Accounting and majors leading to a Health field career are good too, though I’d call them second tier. 13. If you want to study anything else, make a damn good plan about what job you’ll get, what additional education/experience you will need, what grades you’ll need, etc. Fields like Psychology, Mass Communication, Marketing, Criminal Justice, Education, Art, HPEX, anything Liberal Arts (these are a slight exception because they develop good long-run skills), Political Science, Sociology, etc… lead to poor on-average job prospects because they are extremely interesting fields and hence popular. You basically have to compete twice as hard for half the pay compared to the fields mentioned above. **If it’s truly your calling then go for it, I’m not here to completely crush dreams**, just really think hard about whether it’s a calling so strong that you’ll turn down less cutthroat competitive fields that lead to much more stable and predictable financial outcomes for future you. I just know some people who studied these fields who can’t even get an entry-level job making more than they could’ve made without a degree and it’s incredibly sad considering how much debt they went into and how hard they worked. *There’s always the option of double majoring in one of these and something TEM/Finance/Health. That way you get the passion + the fallback financial plan.* 14. STEM is a dumb acronym because Science major's stats are heavily inflated by people who go on to any form of professional or grad school. As just an undergrad degree it’s extremely mid. These are great for preparing you for more school, but if you want a job out of undergrad, study something else. 15. Don’t be pre-med unless you are an exceptional student who truly feels a deep unwavering calling to medicine. I met an insane number of freshmen/sophomores who were pre-med even though it was obvious to any third party observing them that they had 0 chance of ever making it in this cutthroat competitive path, and somebody needs to tell them to stop wasting their time on an impossible dream and be practical. If you aren’t ready to hold a 3.8, volunteer, scribe, work as an emt, and research, all while studying for the MCAT in the background, then this isn’t that path for you. Even one of my most intelligent and hard-working friends has had to fight his ass off 3 cycles just to get a shot at getting into med school before his 27th birthday. Most people (myself included) are not smart and disciplined enough for this path. And most who are could make similar amounts of money with less debt and better work-life balance in other fields. So unless you feel a deep unwavering calling towards the career path, do something else. Don’t just do it because mom and dad pushed you. There are so many great health career fields that don’t involve going $400,000 into debt and being a student for 11 years after high school (PA, nurse, pharmacist, etc…) 16. Don’t be Pre-Law either. It’s another all-consuming path of high debt, poor job satisfaction, and hyper-competitiveness. 17. If your major isn’t working out, the sooner you change it the better. Don’t be afraid to admit failure and find a path you can succeed in. Or even drop out and find a completely alternative path. Be honest with yourself about how you are doing in your field and pivot if the answer is bad and you can’t fix it by working harder alone. **Academics** 18. GPA isn’t everything. It opens the door to good internships and scholarships, but past that it’s low-key useless. My 3.9 got me nowhere, my friends with more well-rounded resumes outran me in the long-run. Extracurriculars and work experience matter so much more for securing a nice job. Don’t get tunnel vision for grades, there is so much more in college. 19. VCU Academic Advisors are (generally) mediocre. Use bulletin to get a good idea of what courses you need to take and which ones to take each semester (you could make a 4-year plan and run it by a trusted older student in your major… that would be a million times better than asking advisors who don’t know shit and don’t have the nuanced knowledge of your specific field. 20. Scope out your profs on RateMyProfessor. No sense taking a course with an asshole who grades hard when you can avoid it. 21. Go to class, even if lectures are an idiotic way to learn in the 21st century. The value of going to class isn’t learning the material, you do that when you study. The value is meeting the people in class, and more importantly: the professors. Professors are generally former industry professionals with insane networks. Get to know them, they're a golden resource to your career. 22. Office hours are an even better way to network with your professor and get them to go easy on grading you 23. Learn how to learn efficiently. I wasted a lot of time overstudying inefficiently. Seek Academic Coaching (this is a thing at VCU) if you need it and watch some YouTube videos on the science of learning. 24. Frontload your semesters. The harder you work the first few months, the easier life will be the rest of the semester. Do all the assignments and extra credits well and ace the first exam and suddenly your set up to be able to do b/c grade work the rest of the semester and still get an A. 25. Track your grades for classes on spreadsheets so you know where you are at and what you need to do to get to your target goals. Professors give the weight of each assignment/test on the syllabus and it’s really easy to plug them into excel and keep track as you go and back engineer what you’ll need on x exam for y grade. 26. It’s ok to plan in advance to just get a B or C in some classes. Prioritize your focus on classes where marginal effort can push you from one grade to the next… choosing to just get a C in your hardest class so you can get As in the rest would still get you a 3.6 for the semester. Raising 3 87s to 90s through marginal effort is better for your GPA than raising one C to an A through insane effort, and letting those 3 87s stay as Bs. 27. Keep a calendar and stay organized. Denote major deadlines on the calendar. Don’t try to plan every second of your day though, just set aside time for the important stuff. Trying to micromanage your schedule will lead to you not being flexible enough to enjoy the spontaneity of college. 28. Don’t schedule all your classes in the afternoon. Force yourself to get up around 8 most days, adult you who won’t be constantly late for work will thank you. 29. Google Docs are great for taking notes, as they auto-save and you can access them from any device you have (or print them after class for a paper copy). **Getting Ready for a Job** 30. Group projects are the most accurate simulation of corporate work life that exist in college, take them seriously and learn how to lead people and work together from them. 31. Don’t commute. Live on campus freshman year then room with friends each year after. Sure you’ll go into more debt (which won’t really matter if you followed the picking the right major advice), but learning to be an independent adult and getting to be immersed in the social life of a college campus is priceless. 32. Networking is the name of the game. It’s not what you know, it’s who you know (well it’s actually a bit of both, but it’s really hard to show what you know if you aren’t introduced to the right people to show it to). 33. Intern early and often. The more internships you do, the better. Don’t waste a summer waiting tables or bagging groceries, get your foot in the door in the industry, even if it’s only tangentially related to your field. 34. Join student organizations and aim to take on leadership roles. Professional societies, cultural associations, religious organizations, interest clubs, sga, etc.. Join as many as you realistically can. They are crucial resume padding items as orgs function very similar to the way corporations do. They are easy networking and also a way to meet like-minded friends or even potential partners. 35. Don’t end up in Richmond for your first job. The access to culture (sports, music, theater, etc…) is limited, most of the 20-somethings are service industry workers, and the cost of living is rapidly on the rise. The good job prospects and the exceptional young people are elsewhere, so follow them. **Financials** 36. Consider going to school 5 years rather than 4. You can stretch out your Pell Grant and other FAFSA/financial aid this way. College is also the best time of your life, and older you will be glad you got the one extra year. This will allow you to take lighter courseloads (hence better grades and more time for networking/internships/clubs/etc). Sure there’s some lost opportunity cost in one year of not making a salary, but I think it’s worth it for the added value of two extra semesters on campus developing yourself. 12 credit semesters are a vibe. 37. Limiting debt, not eliminating it, is the goal. I limited my debt to less than $10,000 by commuting, getting lucky with having poor parents and getting lots of FAFSA money, working a lot during the semesters, and luckboxing some big scholarships. I put so much effort into limiting my debt that I missed out on a lot of the opportunities that being on campus and available would’ve presented me. If you’re coming to college while working 40 hours a week, you might as well just not come to college (exception: you’re an adult making a career change). You’re wasting the opportunity. In the long run, it will absolutely pay off to take a few thousand dollars per semester out in debt to facilitate you to be able to get involved in your studies and on your campus. As long as you are studying the majors I said or have a strong plan on getting a job from a different major, $30,000 extra debt isn’t going to matter than much to you in the long run. 38. Shoot your shot at scholarships, the worst they can say is no 39. Submit your FAFSA on time for priority consideration every year. I once forgot to do it and had to take a gap year. 40. If your parents are willing to pay for things, let them. Don’t let pride get in the way of a free education. If only I could’ve been in this spot. 41. Create a budget template and stick roughly to it 42. I used to advise two years of community college to limit costs, but in hindsight that was poor advice because it inhibits you from maximizing the networking opportunities at VCU, and also in the majors I suggest, it’s better to get a higher quality education at VCU. 43. Don’t get addicted to Starbucks **Social Life** 44. Read the book How To Win Friends and Influence People by Dale Carnegie 45. You are judging yourself 100 times harder than those around you are. Most around you don’t give a shit about what you’re doing. 46. Your social life should develop organically from the student organizations you join and the people you meet in your dorm and classes 47. Start intramural teams with your friends, it’s a nice competitive outlet. Meeting friends through shared sports/exercise interests can happen too (I know rock climbing is a bit of a craze at VCU rn). 48. Be the person who’s willing to plan events and connect with friends who don’t know each other 49. Talk to everyone. It pays. Money. Every appropriate setting you go, be the person who’s willing to start the casual chit-chat. Never know where this might go. 50. Grab the IGs of everyone you meet. Getting that follower count up creates a good first impression for people who meet you and sharing stories of you doing interesting things makes it easy to filter in people interested in doing similar things. 51. I think social media in general (REDDIT INCLUDED) is a massive productivity and mental health drain. Delete stuff like TikTok & Snapchat, only use Reddit from your computer, and don’t mindlessly scroll on IG (use it purposefully to present a good image of yourself and your personality). 52. Don’t be anti-party. Go to ones you are invited to and meet people. Be responsible though. 53. Frats and sororities are underrated on Reddit, they are a social/professional network hand-delivered. Just be careful to check the vibe before you join and don’t let yourself be pressured into stuff like binge drinking on an initiation. Not saying they are right for everyone, just that they have some value to the right sorts of people. 54. Try to meet an older student in your major you can trust that will mentor you. A “big” so to speak. 55. Don’t wallow in how you’re an introvert. Just keep putting yourself out there until you start enjoying it. Ofc you’re going to think you’re an introvert if all you’ve ever done after school is Reddit and video games, try another way of living. Like it or not, people with good social skills and large social networks make it further in life. **Dating (advice will have a straight male skew)** 56. Your dating life should also develop very organically. I made things way too complicated for myself in college, hyper-obsessing over trying to get a girlfriend, when in reality my first relationship came pretty simply through just starting a convo with a girl in a student org I was in and hitting it off. 57. That being said, you still have to shoot your shot. I can think of so many times where I just naturally met girls who were showing signs of interest in me (emailing me out the blue to study together, offering to give me a ride across campus, smiling and waving at me every time they saw me outside of class), and I was too timid to ask them out. The fear of building a negative reputation stopped me from doing what I thought was “shitting where I eat.” Don’t be like that. If there’s someone you click with naturally, go for it as soon as you can. Be direct in your intentions and ask them on a DATE (saying the word, because I can’t count the number of times I ended up on platonic hangouts because I didn’t specify my intents). A simple template: ask them what their favorite food is, then say “we should go on a (insert that food) date (insert evening you have some free time).” First dates don’t need to complex, I also fucked quite a few chances up by going for these elaborate first date requests that were just too much of a commitment (ex: bowling, mini golf, concerts, etc… these are better second dates). 58. Stop blaming your height and ethnicity for your lack of dating success. Relentlessly pursue your best self (especially with fitness), and you will find dating success. 59. Don’t get in a serious relationship without first analyzing if there are any clear incompatibilities that’ll turn into dealbreakers. Don’t ignore them if you see them, cut your losses early before the relationship wrecks your mental and physical health. 60. Don’t get in a serious relationship and then immediately get complacent. Most people I know (myself included) gained weight and stopped hanging around their friends the moment they got in a relationship. Others lost focus on their career ambitions. Don’t do this, grow together instead. 61. If you're afraid to talk to the (insert gender you’re interested in) go to a local mall and start 10 convos with someone of that gender asking for directions. Then do 10 more, complimenting them on something about their clothes. Congratulations, you’re not afraid anymore. Exposure therapy. 62. Class can also be a very good place to get dates. It’s really just as simple as getting to class early enough on day 1 to make sure you can grab a seat by the cutest person and then just start a convo about the class and go from there. I’d urge you not to go the study buddy route, I tried that way too many times and it’s a ticket to the friendzone, honesty with your intentions is key. 63. Fashion + hygiene goes a long way in making you appealing to romantic prospects 64. Guys, don’t be too frustrated if your dating life doesn’t pop off Freshman year. On average, women mature faster than men and hence prefer slightly older guys. When you’re the junior (or even sophomore) who’s been putting in the work on yourself, you’ll start getting chances. 65. Don’t be that person who refuses to date in college. I met a lot of people like this talking about how they’re too busy with their grind or just not interested in dating, and I think it’s a big mistake. It’s literally the last time in your life you’ll be surrounded by like-minded people of the same age group who are generally open to meeting new people. Take it from a dude in his mid-20s, it is rough out here in the post-college land, take advantage of the abundance of options constantly surrounding you. Get some experience and maybe even meet your life partner. **VCU/RVA Specific Tidbits** 66. VCU is an urban campus, which imo makes it by far the most fun and stimulating campus in Virginia. It’s basically intertwined with the city at this point (for better or worse), so you get full access to all the fun stuff the city has to offer. 67. The GRTC Pulse is free and can take you pretty much everywhere interesting in Richmond 68. Richmond is a nice concert city (The National, The Broadberry, The Camel, Canal Club, VACU Live, Browns Island, house shows, etc…). Expand your music taste by looking up some bands coming to town soon and go to a few shows. It’s super fun, can help you meet people, and it’s also something you can invite existing friends to. Most of these venues are just a Pulse ride away. 69. Circuit Arcade + Bar is my favorite date spot in RVA (it’s over 21 after 9 though), there’s an easy pivot to food or a movie nearby. 70. Carytown is a close second. Classy area. 71. VCU basketball games are an incredible experience, especially if you go with friends. The student fan group (Rowdy Rams) also does a trip to the A10 tournament every year that is insanely cheap and gets you to a new city with other students for a good time. 72. Belle Isle is the ultimate beautiful fall/spring day destination with your friend group 73. The VMFA, Maymont, and Canal Walk are three other awesome spots to get away from the stress and see something beautiful. 74. Floor 2 of the Commons is the best spot on campus to get away from the hustle and just relax. I’ve even gone there to cry before, it’s just the perfect spot to be calm and invisible for a bit. 75. There’s plenty of free Parking at VCU if you go down Harrison St past the gym. Can avoid a parking pass entirely if you’re willing to walk a little 76. The Campus Learning Center is a great resource for FREE help in your classes. 77. The renovations they’ve done to Monroe Park are amazing, and it’s a great spot to chill and get work done or hang out. 78. Richmond is a really easy drive (if you have a group) to just about anywhere on the east coast. Would be super easy to do a trip with friends to VA Beach, NYC, DC, the mountains, Philly, Baltimore, etc…. Travel a bit if you can find people who are down. 79. Short Pump is hyped up a lot, but honestly, it’s not worth the drive. There’s not much you can do there you can’t downtown, and the vibe of it is very much adult. 80. Look both ways when you cross the street. You are in a city with lots of traffic. 81. I think the safety concerns at VCU are really overexaggerated by anxious people, but yeah be vigilant and don’t wander too far off campus alone at night. 82. Make Cabbell Library your home away from home, it’s such an amazing lib. Floor 2 was the sweet spot for getting studying done for me, but I’d advise you and your friends to all find a spot you like and have it be the spot you constantly come and go. Can lead to lots of spontaneous social interactions. 83. Run the Monument Avenue 10K every year, and maybe one year get ambitious and try the hm or marathon. Supports the fitness goal and gives you a nice photo op at the end. 84. Try the many restaurants of RVA. I personally stuck heavily to Taco Bell (rip), Chipotle, Panda, Hibachi Box, Christian’s, and Subway… and I regret it. Be adventurous with your eating and invite people to adventure with you. The one spot I’ll recommend is Sushi King at lunchtime. **Post-Graduation** 85. College is over, so get over it. I spent way too much time in my post-college depression phase where I desperately wanted nothing but to go back to the college environment. I’d even drive back to campus and just chill in my old spots just to be there. Don’t do that, it’s not healthy. When you’re done, move on. 86. If you’ve done the work I said before this point, you’re basically set up to coast with a few minor adjustments. You’ll have the requisite major, fitness, social skills, and experience to quickly excel above your peers at work and in life. 87. It will take time to adjust. Corporate life ain’t easy nor is being under true financial pressure. But once you build a 6-month emergency fund in savings and get through your first annual performance review unscathed, you’ll start to calm down and enjoy this new lifestyle. 88. Get in a disciplined routine. Time is your biggest asset in college. You don’t have that as an adult, a bare minimum of 40 hours a week will go towards your career (more likely even more). You need to manage that time exceptionally well to be able to find a balance between work, fitness, and hobbies. Wake up early and exercise before work. Work. Do some studying for career development after work. Do your chores. Then be free to enjoy your hobbies and social life. 89. Dress for success 90. Find your adult social circle (and set reasonable expectations for what role they will play in your life). I wanted that How I Met Your Mother style 6 person tightly knit friend group who hung at the bar every night despite having awesome careers. That’s a bullshit fantasy. You will probably at best see your friends 1-2 times a week, and that’s ok. Learn to make use of that time to do life-enriching activities rather than just chilling and shooting the shit. 91. Save money & budget strictly. You got to get that 6-month emergency fund or the financial anxiety will eat you alive. Put 20% towards savings (you should be able to afford to do this if you studied the right things like I said). 92. Meal prep. Saves an ungodly amount of money and helps with fitness. 93. Max out your 401k contribution, the employer match is a 100% ROI investment. 94. Keep networking 95. Continue your education (I’m not saying go to grad school, just keep learning through industry certifications and adult classes) 96. Travel. You’ve done the hard work and got the big bucks, so go see the world. It just gives you a whole new perspective on life, especially if like me you were a poor kid who barely left your hometown. 97. Dating is going to be a lot harder if you don’t wind up with someone you met from college. You may have to look beyond your social circle for options. 98. Stay in touch with your family. Mend those broken bonds. I am being forced to spend my early 20s living at home because my parents are broke and my mom is dying. Do I regret it? No. Family are the people who matter most at the end of the day, and you will regret it to your core if you disregard those relationships until it’s too late. Obviously, if your parents are truly abusive or irredeemable people, ignore this, but for 90% of you who don’t get along with your parents, it’s over petty nonsense. Or maybe you’re just upset because they pushed you too hard as a kid (the world is a tough place and they were pushing you so hard because they know what it takes to succeed and wanted what’s best for you in the long run). 99. Share your wisdom with younger family/community members. Way too many people are completely butchering the way they live from 18-25, myself included. We need to educate more people on what it takes to actually set yourself up for a successful adulthood. **Other** 100. Lastly, and most importantly: **HAVE FUN**. College is truly the most fun time of your life. You will never again be surrounded by this many intelligent, like-minded, and friendly people of a similar age who have the free time to enjoy life with you. + at VCU you get all of this + you’re in a real-world city with lots of things to do off campus. I met someone recently who was telling me about how college is the bane of their existence and my heart broke a little bit for her. Your classes are not designed to be difficult to the point you don’t have time to enjoy things. Learn to manage your time and prioritize mental, physical, and social health and these years will be incredible. Life isn’t all doom and gloom after college, don’t let anyone tell you that either (you’ll actually make enough money to take trips and do the expensive stuff you like), but college is just a unique and magical place where the youthful energy combined with lack of responsibility and abundance of free time people have create this hyper-social environment where life is amazing. Enjoy it. Adult you will daydream of going back.

Regarding 35 - i don't know that you did during undergrad but you're just completely wrong dude and that's shit advice. In the city you have The National, The Byrd , Altria, VMFA, Maymont, First Fridays, The Coliseum, The Diamond, The Kickers, James River Park System and other venues/events periodically that provide a wide access to culture (sports, music, theater, etc.) sure it's not like the DC area but to say it's limited is a complete lie. Regarding jobs yeah most of the 20 somethings are service industry workers because a) they're college kids (undergrad/post grad) or b) really enjoy that type of work/are working on another job and this is temp. There are good jobs in Richmond (Medical/Finance/Marketing) and really awesome people, if you find a company you enjoy and enjoy the area, then ride it out and see how you feel in a year. But to say the job prospects aren't here is a total lie. >Don’t end up in Richmond for your first job. The access to culture (sports, music, theater, etc…) is limited, most of the 20-somethings are service industry workers, and the cost of living is rapidly on the rise. The good job prospects and the exceptional young people are elsewhere, so follow them.

Understand the career prospects of your chosen major, study, go to class, make friends, don’t die of alcohol poisoning. No need to MinMax your college experience, no need to totally not give a shit either 🤷.

As a fellow alumni, they need to send this out as a pamphlet to all incoming students. Very good advice here, lets just hope these kids listen up haha.

working my way through reading this. just want to say thank you as a rising freshman I'm nervous for school and things going wrong. thx

I’m getting pretty tired of the rhetoric that you won’t make friends or have great experiences if you don’t completely tear down your private life. You’re going to spend an average of 3 hours every day with people inside the classroom, collaborating with your classmates in and out of class. You’ll at one point be in one or more students orgs to collaborate and make connections there. You’ll probably be eating with these people as well, but even if you aren’t who cares. You’re going to be surrounded by a myriad of people and have plenty of options. If you like to study by yourself or want to watch a show alone, go for it. You’re not a hermit for valuing some alone time. If you like to play video games, probably have an online selection of friends, than there’s nothing wrong with that either. That’s still socialization. College, believe it or not, shouldn’t be your peak. You shouldn’t go into your adult years wishing you had a time machine. You shouldn’t feel like you’re on borrowed time because all you’ll do is stress yourself out more than you probably will be from class, homesickness, and general life. And if you want to talk to everyone you’ll cross paths with and sleep in your dorm with the door open, by all means, that’s okay too. Just don’t subscribe to a notion that your college experience should pan out one way and anything else is inherently wrong.

As a fellow alumni, let me just say that this is an excellent post full of really good advice. Everyone should save and share this with people.

I'm here two years later, browsing Reddit as a freshman at VCU, and as the first generation of immigrant parents, boy am I glad I found this—thank you. College is such an exciting but nerve-wracking experience, and while I’m past the first month, I’ve been stuck in a comfortable bubble with my one close friend. We’re both pre-health, so grades and studying are our top priorities. Reading this genuinely widened my perspective. I’ll take your advice with me for the rest of college. Hope you're doing well! I’ll be starting *How to Win Friends and Influence People* tomorrow. Again, thank you—I'll definitely come back to refresh on your advice.

Bro settle down Lmaoooo this is cringe

One of the best things to do in school is to take advantage of office hours and get to know your professors. Even in a large lecture, if you have questions, go to the professor afterwards and ask. Being an interested and connected student is important on several levels; the most basic being greater knowledge and higher grades, but also the more intangible ones such as getting to know your professor (I keep in touch with several of mine after 30+ years), or having a relationship with someone who can later write you an informed recommendation for graduate school.

I think Richmond is a great college city (you can read in my RVA/VCU tidbits section how much I love almost all those activities you listed), wouldn't recommend another school in VA over VCU, but I think it becomes less enjoyable (but not completely unenjoyable) after graduation, at least in my experience. It's going to completely depend on your personality and what you value though. I personally value live entertainment (concerts (arena and niche bands skip RVA for DC/Raleigh), sports, theater, comedy, etc...), meeting a high volume of new & diverse people who have similar goals/are in the same season of life as me, ambition, weird new experiences, not having to drive, amazing restaurants, fun activities, etc... Basically, I like to be hyper-stimulated and be in a walking/public transport distance of everything I do so I don't have to save energy to drive home (and so I don't have to get way too much sleep so I don't die during my morning commute) Maybe that's the difference in our perceptions of RVA's access to culture, I've just set a really high bar for the amount of access I want, and it can't keep up. Richmond has a lot of these things to an extent, but bigger cities completely blow them out of the water in these areas. If you're a more even-keeled personality who's looking for comfort & stability, then Richmond is 100% a great city to wind up in and start a life for yourself. Personally, I'm just really bored of it and really wish I could go move to NYC with a friend of mine who's really getting to live that high-flying 20s lifestyle I want. I can't though, my parents are poor/sick and need the financial support, so it's just a fantasy (also had to turn down the chance to pursue huge jobs in my industry because I had to confine my search to RVA, which ended me up in a dead end entry level job). And it's also not that the 20-somethings in RVA being service industry workers makes me want to not be their friends, it's that it's hard to be their friends because we usually run completely different schedules and have little in common.

Yeah I was a little thrown off when I read the part that went along the lines of “If you find college is easy, then change it up.” If college is easy, then you’re one lucky mf

Oh, and the whole “you won’t find true love, there’s literally never a chance to meet someone after college” schtick is total bullshit. Just another artificial stressor.

You don't have to completely tear down your private life, and taking time to get away from it all is advisable (maybe an occasional Saturday back home or locked away in your dorm), but I stand by that the best way to generate value out of your college experience is to put in a lot of effort to be involved & social. Again, my advice is just based on my experience (analyzing why my college experience was largely a failure, and things I'd change about it if I had a mulligan), so take it with a grain of salt. You absolutely can succeed in college being a total hermit, or even just being modestly involved, but I'm just saying you'd succeed even more if you incorporated lots of socializing/networking/orgs. From my vantage point, the people who are living the best lives as adults (have nice jobs, get to travel a lot, have a large social and professional network of people all across the country, have hobbies they are proud of and maybe even can monetize) are the ones who were focusing on being involved in different communities/interests across campus, and seldom went a day without being on campus and socially active. And yes, college shouldn't be your peak, that's the point I'm trying to make. You need to put a lot of effort into laying the foundations for successful adulthood during college. These things which are relatively easy to fix during college (fitness, career, finding friends/a partner, etc) become immensely more difficult to fix when you're thrust into a 40+ hour a week corporate job coupled with massive financial responsibility. Not to mention that as an adult, there's no just walking outside your dorm and seeing 30,000 people your age with shared experiences who are ready to socialize with you, you've got to look really hard and be very forward if you want to try to work your way into pre-defined social circles as an adult. And a college semester is like 16 weeks, with a week worth of breaks worked in. My advise would be to just push yourself really hard in all areas during those 16 weeks, then go really hard at your non-social hobbies during the break when people aren't around campus. 16 weeks of study/networking/gym/etc followed by a month of binging Netflix, video games, etc. I'm just saying that as an adult who spent a lot of time in college on Netflix & video games especially, that I have plenty of time to play those now if I want to, but I don't have any way to live that sort of a hyper social lifestyle again.

What makes this cringe?

Yep. Office hours is great for networking w/ the prof, and showing them you're putting in effort (which can in turn lead to a better grade in the class).

I value the same level of entertainment (grew up in the DC Area) but you're still in a central point where you can drive/carpool or take a train/bus to DC or Charlottesville or Norfolk to catch a big name concert, but also you have to look at Richmond being a small city so there are gives and takes, you're never gonna get the DC, LA or NYC or Chicago experience but to say Richmond doesn't offer: >high volume of new & diverse people who have similar goals/are in the same season of life as me, ambition, weird new experiences, not having to drive, amazing restaurants, fun activities, etc... is completely false, you get all of that in the city and campus. "You get back, what you put out" applies to that above and below: >And it's also not that the 20-somethings in RVA being service industry workers makes me want to not be their friends, it's that it's hard to be their friends because we usually run completely different schedules and have little in common. You'd be surprised how much you actually do have in common and when you actually make time for your friends, most of my friends/roommates were service industry people and we always made the effort or time to see each other/keep in touch still to this day, I'll drop by and visit them at work whenever I am in town or driving through. I'm sorry your situation had turned and I know it's tough especially with sick parents and being the sole provider but you'll overcome and prevail, just remember "the grass isn't always greener on the other side".

Also feels like this person has built a life for themselves that they don’t really like considering they end with “Enjoy it. Adult you will daydream of going back.” 😬 Instead you should be using your college years to lay the foundation for a current life that allows you to not yearn for 4 years in your younger life you will never get back.

Depends on what the activities you're doing are. If you're studying a great major you have a good plan for, working out consistently, on leadership in a couple student orgs, and have a great internship lined up for the summer, and that feels easy for you, great! I'm not saying burn yourself out trying to do too much. But what I'm saying is that most people probably aren't pushing themselves as hard as they could be, and that'll be a regret for them when they reach my age. Me personally I thought I was pushing myself hard because I got top gradesand had an ok job on campus, even if my life felt like a total breeze and I had like maybe 30 hours of responsibility a week. So when you're life feels easy, ask yourself if it's because you've actually built sustainable habits that make the inputs to the success you desire just feel completely natural, or if it's because you're simply doing easy activities. If I had pushed myself with just a harder major, more involvement in orgs, applying for ambitious internships, and developing a gym routine my life in college would not have felt easy. It would've been a struggle. I'd probably have had a 3.0 rather than a 4.0 most semesters. But in doing so, I'd have learned so much more and pushed myself so much further, that I'd be way further along as an adult. Cruising to a 4.0 every semester is a telltale sign you just don't have enough on your plate. So I guess I stand by what I said. If college feels extremely easy to you, you're probably missing out on valuable growth because you're cherrypicking activities that are too easy.

I never said it's impossible, it's definitely not, I just said it gets more difficult. In college, you can meet people through orgs, classes, parties, or even just randomly on campus. In adulthood, you have to start relying on shitty apps, drunk interactions at bars/clubs, and workplace crushes that you're afraid you'll ruin your career if you take action on. Your social circle as an adult (especially if you didn't establish a nice college friend group), just isn't giving you opportunities on a silver platter like it would in college. At the very least, college is the right time to get a lot of dating experience to make yourself more ready for the more infrequent opportunities that you come across in adulthood.

“Don’t study STEM if you want a job out of undergrad” “Delete your games. People who level up online don’t level up IRL” Aside from the common sense financial advice and “don’t get a degree if u don’t care about the major”….It doesn’t read like “a victory lap about how I succeeded in college”. It sounds like a huge list of oddly specific advice that nobody asked for from some 30 something person who truly believes college was the best time of their life Becuase they walked in a Christian sexist and came out an educated yuppie lol

Well, yes. But apart from grade-raising and networking, one hopes you are actually interested in your classes and want to know more about what you are learning. I just got an email from my dean for first year some 37 years ago; these friendships can last a long time.

"I value the same level of entertainment" I don't think you do (and that's why we are disagreeing), because if you did you'd recognize the massive gulf in quality/quantity between entertainment access in RVA compared to the biggest cities. We've got two 3rd tier sports teams, these cities have 5+ big league teams. We get a Nascar race twice a year, they get almost every major sporting tour every year. We get lots of great mid-tier concerts, they get every single band gigantic or niche that tours on every cycle. We've got some great restaurants, they've got many world-class ones. And with career choices too. We've got 8 Fortune 500 companies, NYC has 65. Not trying to shit on Richmond, it's a great city, but let's not understate how much more entertainment & career chances bigger cities have. If someone is very ambitious and loves that sort of stimulating lifestyle, why not go find the biggest job in the biggest city this can and try out that lifestyle? There's always the choice to later come back to RVA (with a much-inflated salary offer).

Yes, that's what I was trying to say, the whole post was a reflection on how my experience in college failed to set me up for successful adulthood. Which is why I recommend doing a lot of delayed gratification activities in college (study a TEM major, networking, working out, etc...) that will help set you up for adulthood success. But at the same time as doing the hard work, you can acknowledge that the environment of college (being surrounded by like-minded people in your age group who've got an abundance of free time and are generally really social) is a once-in-a-lifetime phenomenon and should be enjoyed while you're there. No one I know who's an adult is living a more fun or social lifestyle than they were in college. There are plenty of silver linings to adulthood (being able to afford amazing vacations, financial stability, expensive hobbies, etc), but college is definitely the last chance to live that hypersocial a lifestyle.

*Edit: you all are going to give that many upvotes for quoting things I didn't even say or taking them so drastically out of context that they completely lose the tone of the message?* Not sure why you are being upvoted for this when you are literally misquoting me and editorializing my quotes to make my advice sound a lot more ridiculous and me sound very arrogant. I'm all for constructive criticism on this, as I said it's a very biased POV and I originally made it just to help a family member out, but ended up with something that felt worth sharing. But if you're going to criticize, at least understand what I wrote first. *“Don’t study STEM if you want a job out of undergrad” --* (I did not say this) **I said don't study** ***Science*** **if you want a job out of undergrad. TEM I recommend highly (I rate them the best majors). I've known many people who study science and can't find a quality job without going to grad school.** *“Delete your games. People who level up online don’t level up IRL”* **Just my opinion. You also conveniently left out the** ***"during the semester"*** **rider to the advice. I found my video game addiction really hurt my social life. People who are less addicted and able to play casually might not need to worry about that so much. The family member I started writing this for also has a serious video game addiction.** *"Aside from the common sense financial advice and “don’t get a degree if u don’t care about the major”….It doesn’t read like “a victory lap about how I succeeded in college”* **Paragraph 2 of the post starts with: “This post** ***isn’t*** **a victory lap about how I succeeded in college, it’s lots of hard lessons I learned as a first-generation college student who had no role model for how to set myself up to achieve long-run success during college, and despite having good intentions ended up making a lot of bad decisions that led to (currently) having a mediocre career, limited social life, and poor mental/physical health.” This was a failure lap, not a victory lap, and I acknowledged that, so stop trying to paint me as this arrogant person bragging about his success (I'd have to be delusional to do that with my current life situation).** **I also did not say "don't get a degree if u don't care about the major." In fact, I said the opposite. I said to pick a high-quality major, and back engineer that to a job, unless you have a truly blazing passion for a career in a less high quality major and are smart/disciplined enough to distinguish yourself from the competition.** *“It sounds like a huge list of oddly specific advice that nobody asked for from some 30 something person who truly believes college was the best time of their life Becuase they walked in a Christian sexist and came out an educated yuppie lol”* **Yes, it’s oddly specific advice because it’s my biased POV, which I acknowledged. Someone did ask for it (my family member) and I just thought it ended up being worth sharing. And, I’m mid 20’s. I don’t have a well-paying job or a fashionable lifestyle (at least relative to what a college-educated person should have). This wasn’t a “How I Succeeded” post, it was a “How I Failed” post. Yes I do think college was the best time of my life, and I explain thoroughly why (because social life is on easy mode compared to adulthood).** So like at least read and try to comprehend what I wrote if you’re going to flame it. You're completely misrepresenting my argument. I don't know if you're intentionally misrepresenting what I said to be a douche or you just have the reading comprehension skills of a 6th grader, but either way it's an unfair way to argue. Literally, the only things you got right in 4 paragraphs was me shedding religion/sexism, giving oddly specific advice, and advising people to not play video games (leaving out that I said just during the semester). If you want to offer points that I actually said without editorializing them and offer reasons why they are bad advice, please do.

Settle down dude. Im very obviously paraphrasing, and telling you how what you said came across. And it came across as wack lmao. Sorry you disagree that it was cringe. Most ppl who post cringe usually do.

You were paraphrasing me very incorrectly. It's quite disrespectful to take 30 seconds to skim through a large document someone put a lot of effort into making, and cherrypick 3-4 out of context lines to misrepresent the tone/content of it. If you want to actually go through and takes actual points I made in their proper context and give reasons you dislike the advice, please do, that would be very helpful to give people more perspective.

If you're going to say oopsie, actually fix what you said rather than leaving your lies up. >“Don’t study **S**~~TEM~~ if you want a job out of undergrad” > >“Delete your games (**DURING THE SEMESTER)**. People who level up online don’t level up IRL” > >~~Aside from the~~ common sense financial advice ~~and “don’t get a degree if u don’t care about the major”~~….~~It doesn’t read like “a victory lap about how I succeeded in college”.~~ (*wasn't supposed to read like a victory lap, as I said in paragraph 2, rather a failure lap*) > >It sounds like a huge list of oddly specific advice ~~that nobody asked for~~ from some ~~30 something~~ person who truly believes college was the best time of their life Becuase they walked in a Christian sexist and came out ~~an~~ educated ~~yuppie~~ lol There. If you disagree that science majors don't go get good jobs out of undergrad, that video games harm productivity/social life during the semester, and that college is the best of your life, elaborate on why and we can have an actual sincere discussion, which I welcome. And if you convince me, I'll edit the OP and remove the advice. Just misrepresenting what I said isn't adding value to anyone.

I will defend this library spot with my life, I’m going to miss it so much when I graduate

Put up a commemorative plaque!

Become an alumni patron, if you’re staying in Richmond. It’s free! https://guides.library.vcu.edu/alumni

Dude if that’s the place on the third floor that’s also my go to place at night!

Phenomenal idea

Yeah it is!! Stay away it’s my spot >:) (jk)

imma keep it warm for u

Thank u ahahah, hopefully I’ll bump into u and I can introduce myself!

Mike Rao says campus is safe, freshmen. Why would he lie? What would he have to gain?

“What inspired you to [reopen VCU in-person and put every student at risk of getting COVID-19]?” Rao: “Money.”

Rao is a massive piece of shit. Once it's safe to gather we need to protest until he resigns in disgrace.

I'm so tired of VCU's panic porn daily emails. Sheesh. Dr Klink just sent one around 3 PM "expectations and consequences". Kindergarten here we go! It really is insulting how little the VCU leaders think of the VCU members Get over it. This isn't Ebola and chances are you and everyone else has probably already gotten it but you did not have symptoms. Go lick the door knobs and stairwell railings. herd immunity is where its at, Rammmmily! LMAO

Dude raises our tuition 106% over the last 11 years and his own salary 109% Forgive me for accusing the man of being greedy

It is tho, look at their username

wrong subreddit for covid debate sport

As someone who commutes for school and lives with an immunocompromised parent, bringing the virus home has very real and possibly devastating consequences. Not everyone in the VCU community can just “get over it”, some professors have kids or are immunecompromised themselves. It’s not herd mentality to listen to science and try our best to avoid it so we don’t make our community sick (or die for some). It’s that mentality that leads to its further spread.

Hmmmm a 1 day old account

Everyone says they think they had it. Myself included until I had a negative antibody test. But I still don't want that shit, even if it wouldn't kill me.

ow the edge

Thanks for your input!

VCU is not isolated, so spread at VCU affects the entire Richmond community. Call us crazy, but some of us actually want RPS to reopen on February 8, 2021. We can’t do that without the community - which includes VCU - stepping up.

I meant the opposite of what you think

I'd skip class the first two weeks if I were you. It'll probably move online after that.

i’ve been thinking about this all week

The library has bedbugs? It that why there was all that caution tape up when I went there yesterday?

I just want to say that I’ve had bedbugs, and I didn’t see a live one until a week and a half after my bites stared. You can’t ignore the problem just because you don’t see any crawling around. Y’all don’t want to pick them up, **trust me.**

Supposedly a bedbug was sighted, but there haven’t been any seen since and they’ve brought in exterminators. I have a friend who works there.

on the other hand, i heard that they found bedbugs, fleas, AND lice.

I can 100% assure you that is not the case. They found *evidence* of bedbugs - like droppings or a corpse or whatever - but no live bedbugs, and certainly no other vermin. I dunno where these rumors are coming from but they're totally unfounded

thank god, i’ve been avoiding the library so this gives me some peace of mind.

Yeah, I wouldn't worry about it, nor would I avoid the library. The situation was more or less completely resolved two nights ago when they had exterminators come in, and now it's just taken on a weird rumor-mill based inertia. The library is completely clean and useable now, no more signs of any kind of infestation. Its actually kinda funny to hear people have been talking about fleas and lice as well, since knowing library employees I've been apprised of whats actually happening, and it was really a very small incident.

Congrats to all the December grads!

Congratulations! The journey was long and was by no means easy!

Nice. Enjoy the ceremony?

Congrats buddy

Congratulations!

Aye! Congrats, PK! lol

Speaker wss much better than my undergrad ceremony so many years ago.

Photos from tonight off twitter: photo credits @jahdkhalil

If you are looking for more updates I would suggest Twitter and the local news:

I'm sorry for my ignorance, but I'm not a student. Can I get some more context on the second picture? What building is that? Again, my apologies and thank you!

This is exhausting to hear and look at.

That would be the main VCU library.

Imagine tuning into what's been going on in Palestine every morning for years. This kind of exhaustion really can't compare to those living with apartheid

We’ve all got this. Finish strong! It’s okay to be stressed as we close out the semester. Just hang in there and do what you can! Good luck everyone!

we got this 💪

Some photos I took of the new Ram City Market in case anyone’s curious. It just opened this week.

I wish we would’ve had this on campus when I was there. I thought it was groundbreaking when we got a Chili’s.

wow and I thought the walmart on campus when I was there was good. I would have loved to have vegetables and meat walking distant from my dorm

Ah, it opened just in time for the majority of the student body to leave campus. Good timing! /s

What is Ram City market and why does it appear to carry higher quality meats than the grocery stores ever have?

ima be so so real . when i go in there i feel like an npc

Wait it opened last week. Regardless here are some pics

I wonder if it will stay open during breaks. I’d imagine it would have to because the food could go bad, lol.

If they had better milk I would get it from there. But probably not after seeing the price.

This looks so much better than the Walmart that was in campus. They didnt have meat or produce so this is a nice change :)

They also have rotating meals which is great!

Crazy , that place used to be a Walmart.

I might go check it out tonight but so many people on the 2026 Snapchat story were telling us about the long line and someone talked about how one lady was accusing people of stealing

Nice. This is on campus?

I hope they are registered with snap but don’t have much faith ://

All the prices of Whole Foods and none of the quality!

Update that the chilli's just unfortunately closed down.

Why leaving campus? I personally still have 4 finals

RCM is part of the dining operations on campus, so they take dining plans. Meat comes from same supplier Whole Foods uses.

Yep yep, it’s near the Panda Express

Looks like they’re in the process of applying, here’s an excerpt from the news article about it: Ram City Market will accept swipes, Dining Dollars, cash, debit, credit and RamBucks. It is also applying through the U.S. Department of Agriculture to accept payments through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).

Makes sense - those without cars can get non junk food. Shouldn’t it be the Ram express? 😁😁

Wow!! That’s exciting :) thank you for responding!!🌸

apparently Grace and broad is down too

Am I abouta become homeless 💀

My dorm had mold allll in the carpet when I was a freshman. It's really not a big deal, be greatfull.

Has mold too, not shut down

I phase this poorly, there are reports of black mold, but they haven't shut down the dorm

U tellin us to be grateful living in black mold? 💀

Anyone who has read anything about mold could tell you that it is a big deal. What are you telling people to be grateful for?

Oh yeah my apt has hella mold

There are so many homeless people in Richmond. Think before you speak.

So we’re not allowed to be angry over the adverse health effects we’re experiencing? Mold kills people.

I did think before I spoke and I don't see what your point is

I know this is a joke, but I'm pretty sure RRTC is about job training for people with disabilities (that kind of rehab, not AA)

Ah, I feel at home again

curb your alcoholism

fucking pick up after yourselves

Alcoholics don’t drink Smirnoff...

Empty alcohol containers might as well be part of Richmond’s ecosystem

yeah that wasn’t directed at you just assholes in general

I’m well aware, that applies globally pretty much. Doesn’t mean you shouldn’t tell people to pick up after themselves. Fuck having broken glass everywhere and fuck having microplastic in the water.

Haha yeah I got you ! I completely agree

Dear drivers, please don't stop at green lights to let people cross I know you think you're being nice, but you're going to get someone killed. Not only is that a good way to get rear-ended, but you're fucking up the traffic pattern for everybody. Just yesterday I saw a student almost get creamed at the light in front of the Temple building, because someone someone stopped at the green light and waved them across, and a car in the other lane (rightfully) drove through and almost hit them. If they had gotten run over, it wouldn't have been fault of the driver that hit him, it would have been the fault of the car that stopped, and of the pedestrian for not paying attention. TL;DR, If you have the right of way, USE it. You're not being as helpful as you think you are.

how is driving so hard for some people? truly a mystery to me.

In the same way that crossing the street is hard for some people.

The biggest problem is I see alot of students cross when they shouldn't. It's annoying.

SO MUCH THIS. I’ve been crossing main st in front of Snead every god damn day of my life for the past 2 years and I shit you not, every other day some wayward samaritan stops in the middle lane during rush hour to let a flock of students by. Just today I saw a girl nearly get flattened. And yes, of course use common sense and don’t cross when this happens but SO OFTEN when you don’t cross the person gets mad as hell. I have been cursed out for not accepting an offer to cross. Literally had them roll down the window and flip me off, call me a bitch or to gfm. I think in that period of stillness—pedestrian locking eyes with driver—they realize how idiotic they look stopped dead in the middle of a four lane road and become distressingly insecure, lashing out. So I can see how some students could feel intimidated into accepting an offer to cross without thinking. Especially kids coming from rural/suburban areas that aren’t used to crossing busy streets. And even if the person isn’t glaring daggers at you for UNDERSTANDABLY HESITATING, it’s just an awkward situation that can cause a lapse in judgement. For that I can’t blame the students crossing too terribly much; the driver’s at fault for being a moron first. Good lord, if this isn’t my hugest pet peeve. Sorry for the caps, I’m passionate and also on mobile.

The problem is that by the ancient laws of Virginia when you hit a pedestrian, unless there's a suicide note involved you are going down.

An issue that is the dumbass kids don't care and cross regardless, so not letting them cross involves running them over. And that's fine, because I could use the entertainment and something to gossip about, like when that one broad got splattered by the bus. Sometimes I really do think that people are looking for free tuition or something from a lawsuit.

I'm not saying blow through the intersection with your eyes closed lol. But I see people stop and wanna pedestrians across when the light is green. I saw someone make the next two cars behind them have to sit at the red light because they wanted to sit at the green. If I had been stuck behind them I would have lost my damn mind

The car that hit the pedestrian would have man slaughter chargers at least but, Richmond has some stupid fucking drivers none the less.

Checking In Hey there friends. I’m trying to find the person who posted on here a few weeks ago that they were willing to pay someone for a hug. I can’t find the post anymore so I assume it was deleted. If you made that post please know how much you matter. Your kind energy is palpable, even through the internet. If you need anything there are one million and four people that are here to catch you if you need. Your community is all around you I promise.

i was trying to find that post too!! i really hope they’re okay, if i wasn’t out of state i would’ve given them a hug for free 😞

i don’t even go here but this is actually so nice i’m so happy there’s people like this in the world and likely there will be people like there where im about to go too . i love you all 😭😭😭

Mental health. As you may have heard there was recently a student who ended their life in the honors dorm on campus. I want to put this out here because I don’t want anyone to feel like this ever. Mental health is real and does matter, please take care of yourself especially as finals come up. Talk to those who are close to you and you can trust and if you feel you don’t have anyone use a help-line a service, if you don’t feel comfortable with any of that and cannot reach out to someone, reach out to me, my messages are open and available, you are never alone I promise.

Student counseling is 24/7. Their number is 804-828-6200 and option 2 is if you call after hours. There is also 988 available to you.

Im so upset to hear about this. I pray for his family.

These are amazing!!

Seconding this! VCU’s University Counseling Services is open for in-person walk-in crisis/support from 9-5pm. You can call that number (804-828-6200) and press option 2, if it’s after 5pm or if you would just rather receive support over the phone. All VCU students also have free access to the TimelyCare app, which has a 24/7 crisis support chat service

As do I. I hope everyone stays safe and takes care of themself and look out for others especially as finals come around the corner because they can be incredibly stressful but it is important to remember that your health is also important.

It's a resource I wish more of us realized is given to us. It's completely free as well

As do I, I have bad experiences with high school counselors but I didn’t know they were still mandatory reporters, as are VCU counselors I believe, however they are so much more well equipped to handle things.

Being a mandated reporter isn't necessarily a bad thing. It's there to keep people safe. I understand that being uncomfortable about it because people are mandated reporters, but at the end of the day, it's with your well-being and mind and so that you can get the help that you might need so that something like this won't happen.

It isnt always a bad thing, it just wasnt what I needed at the time, it made my personal situation a lot worse but also I know it is their job and they don’t have much of a choice. I know many people that have benefited from mandatory reporters and I am appreciative that they still did what they thought was best

New COVID-19 numbers. It's only a matter of time before we're gone.

Just gotta wait for all the room and board payments to clear

Well it’s been a nice 15 days

Notice how it does not list the numbers for people who live "off campus" I know someone who is in Isolation/Quarantine off campus. I wonder if their counted.

Heard 20 positive tests from Mens Track alone, not to mention almost every team can’t practice for at least rest of sem, definitely more than 58

I'm so sorry guys, if you're a freshman what a shitty experience to come to college for =(

The school is committing a sin. Greed. I’m one of the lucky ones fully online (for the next three weeks afaik) but hopes and prayers for everyone on campus.

The scary number is the entry number. That's on a volunteer basis and most of those folks are just doing the test to do it for research. And we had 15 people who found out they had through this test

Sorry for the poor collegiate experience all the new students have to deal with. VCU should not have opened in person this semester, but the business model demands it. I'm skipping this semester. Hopefully things look better in the spring.

Shame on President Rao.

It's only a matter of time before the entire campus is dead.

And for add/drop to be over so they can keep the tuition.

the super-weird thing is that from everything we've heard and read, it actually will end up costing schools *more* to send students home than it would have never to have brought them here in the first place.

Probably only if they reported it to VCU themselves through that daily check.

Yeah I hate this.

Feels bad for anyone looking to graduate too

Same. I’m glad to be studying 2 hours away from Vcu

I thought testing was mandatory before the return to campus

It seems (reported by [richmond times dispatch](https://richmond.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/faculty-challenge-credentials-of-covid-19-testing-company-working-with-vcu-two-other-schools/article_42da3127-9327-5b63-bb49-eadd4a3bf589.html)) that the company running the testing was very recently established and not approved by the FDA, so the results of those tests are questionable

Yeah that’s concerning to say the least. Still, the voluntary basis comment is inaccurate according to the requirements to move on to the campus (does not mean off campus students aren’t facing some challenges)

idea to stay connected during fall sem.... opinions & how to go about it?

This is such a great idea. I bet it could be done at Marcus David Peters circle! There’s been a little radical library, clothing swaps, community prints days, so this would fit right in! And reasonably close to campus..otherwise maybe contact the VCU free store and see if it’s something they’d support over there

Someone’s boutta show up with a marijuana plant lmfao

You could probably ask the Free Blockbuster RVA people on Instagram how they did their program and take some ideas

I love this idea and would definitely participate! Perhaps you could post on the nextdoor app or a vcu facebook group if you’re targeting more students?

On campus? Lol thing would be empty in 5 minutes

Yesssss super cute

VCU Police: OK SHOWS OVER NO MORE PLANT STAND

No complaints here

maybe it has to be a plant exchange then, idk i’m gonna post it in a fb group and see what happens!

We got pass fail

Yes!! and I think the deadline to get the pass/fail grading system is after finals/ May 15 too!

I'll gladly take me, my broken sleep schedule, and 3.29 GPA in comp sci and accept this blessing.

So it’s my understanding that you still have to have at least a C in the class for it to count towards your degree is that right?

Lmao feel like this is some damage control for that video. Anyways I’m excited that calc won’t be destroying my gpa this semester

[Link to email](https://orange.hosting.lsoft.com/list/ov8ia944/200326AT/edag6tcecl2q.vib?a0=7360)

Wait does that mean there’s no way for me to get out of academic warning this semester

For classes we have A's in, are we allowed to count those towards GPA while choosing pass/fail for the other classes?

Now can we get partial refunds on facilities fees?

It depends on your degree and the class. If your major accepts a D as a “pass” for the class and you don’t need a C in the course as a prerequisite to move on to another course, you’re good with a D if you choose the pass/ fail option (D= PS). There’s a lot of info about this in the webpages that are linked in the email. Also, the withdrawal deadline got pushed back again, to 4/30.

Yeah, no. This is thanks to a faculty committee who met (virtually) several times in the past week and sent out 2-3 versions of a proposed policy to faculty/staff for feedback. The first version was much less flexible for students. The committee listened to the feedback they got and made the final policy extremely favorable for students. The video came out towards the very end of this process, probably after the policy had been all but finalized. The vast majority of faculty and staff (literally, probably 99%) had no knowledge of what was going on at the honors college until that video came out.

What video?

Pass/fail is optional so if you’re in the process of bringing up your grades right now, you can leave them as As/Bs/Cs/whatever. All of this is completely optional, so you won’t be forced to use pass/fail. Good luck, you got this!

No, a fail still negatively affects your GPA.

You submit a p/f form by May 14th and you get to choose whichever you want to make p/f

Thanks for clarifying for students. There was no way that a resolution/policy could have been turned around in a day.

What was the first version?

The honors college one

My understanding (as an advisor) is that your current academic standing won’t change if you choose to make ALL of your classes pass/fail, and then you pass all of them. Otherwise, academic standing will be calculated as normal: you will roll into probation if your cumulative GPA stays below 2.0, or you will go back on good standing if your cumulative GPA increases to 2.0 or higher. But yes- please also talk to your advisor!! They can help you figure out how to run the numbers on your GPA calc to see what makes the most sense for you specifically. It’s especially important to speak to them if you’re doing historical repeats this semester.

Nicee. But does that apply to every single course? Like professors can't say "No you have to receive a grade for this class." ??

I’ll dm you.

it's literally in the q&a but yes its for all courses https://gyazo.com/b5cdf47e5c26a4074b0388757a06dbf1

Hell yea. I can keep my 4.0 gpa

Sama haha. I honestly don't think I would have been able to keep it in one class, but that won't be an issue now

Offering parallel parking lessons for $100 Joking, but for real watching some of you guys try to park hurts my soul lol

Hurts my bumpers too.

Simply turn your wheels 90 degrees and slide into your spot. Smh it’s not hard y’all. Also joking.

Going to VCU helped perfect my parallel parking. When you spot an open space on Cary St on the left side of the road with other cars coming up behind you, you learn how to parallel park mirrored really quick.

Yeah my bumper is royally fucked because of 3 years of street parking at VCU. One person put such deep scratches in my bumper that it's likely a $500 fix. I love my car, but I just can't afford that. So, fuck whoever did that and thought it was okay to just bail.

i was about to take you up on this :(

Parallel parking is 100x easier if your car has a rear view camera and rear proximity sensors to warn you before banging into the car behind you. Students in 20 years will think nothing of parallel parking! Of course, by then, their cars will drive themselves.

That's why they call them bumpers </3 Edit: last night someone left me a note with $15 and said that they bumped into the back of my car in the parking deck, when there was little to no damage whatsoever. I still maintain that this is why they call them bumpers.

I know this was created for jokes, but as a former valet I can provide some free advice: 1) Use your side mirrors: barring unusual circumstances, you likely have a car with side mirrors that enable you to alter the angle being shown. When you’re parallel parking these are your friends because they will help you gauge how close your tire is getting to the curb as your backing in. Please use them. 2) Use your rear tires: sounds silly, but heat me out. People forget that tires are heavily rubberized, and therefore quite strong. If you’re backing in slowly and paying attention to how close the front and back of the car is to the vehicle you’re in between, it’s okay to tap the curb with your tire. Just make sure that it’s the rubber and not the rim (the scratchable/breakable part). I’m also happy to help out on the weekend or something in exchange for a Chipotle bowl or something along those lines. Feel free to reach out if you’d like!

You just gotta put that blinker on with plenty of warning and then give no f*cks. Don’t let anyone pressure you. They’re driving in a city, they know the rules.

[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4LcfZeS4qw) does a really good job of explaining it. I can do it but still kind of scary, especially with people behind you. Best to practice on a weekend (especially in the morning) if you can manage though!

I was gonna type out how I do it, but [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4LcfZeS4qw) probably will explain it simpler and better than I can!

I saw a :( so heres an :) hope your day is good

I actually don't like rear view cameras. I don't like the fisheye effect

Excellent advice. Rule of thumb is to put the back bumper off the front car next to your rear most side window, cut the wheel all the way, start backing in, then ease the wheel back as you pass a 45 degree angle

This comment should not be getting down voted! Too many cars in RVA pressure you, honk, zoom around dangerously, etc. when people are parking....no wonder driversare scared to do it. Then they rush and mess up, making the process take longer. No one WANTS to be behind someone parking, especially if they're slow, but RVA is lucky to have so much parking available. And be honest, 99% of the time you're just going to get pick up a pizza or go watch The Office for the fifth time, so most of us aren't doing anything important enough to freak out over the wait.

1.5x the body length to parallel park is a lot. I feel like 1.25x is plenty easy with a bit of practice.

You know a total ban on "greek life" would probably be better.

I hate “Greek life”

all they do is rape and kill and the school is still like "Ahh no they do community service though!"

Anyone can do what ever. The question should be asked if taxes/ tuition should be used for covering, funding and supporting organizations that have a long history of alleged issues and allegations not to mention a number of deaths. The university has a entire office set up for these organizations. Why? That's a lot of funding for such a risky investment based on all the news reports of issues.

Never really understood the purpose of the Greek stuff. Wasn't my cup of tea.

School sponsored binge drinking and r@pe clubs.... Yes there are good dudes within some of them but in this case the bad apples heavily outweigh the good ones.

So because one frat was bad they should all be banned? I don’t understand

I can understand the disdain for fraternities, and yes there are problems that they introduce, but it’s narrow minded to say they should just be banned. Many of the problems that come with “fraternities” are more or less just problems that are exacerbated by alcohol. Though I expect if VCU became a dry campus and started punishing students over 21 for having alcohol a lot of people would be upset even if they supported getting getting rid of frats. Not to mention all the other consequences that could come of that. That might mean sororities need to be removed as well, and frats and sororities that exist to support students of color. I just feel like that solution is overreaching, and I think it’s coming from a place of personal spite

Sup. I live in Richmond and have an anecdote to share regarding frats, and propose a potential idea for a solution. I started college at Southern Illinois University - Carbondale. the year (or two) before my freshman year, there was a hazing incident where 3 people died by drowning in the campus lake after having consumed large amounts of alcohol. As a response to this, the university shut down ALL fraternities for 3 years. Sororities were left to operate as normal. During that 3 year period the university studied frat behavior and what led to this culture of hazing. When frats were allowed to restart it was under much more scrutiny from the school with a lot more limitations on what was allowed. I feel a similar idea could work at VCU. shut down for a year or two, study what is fueling the bad culture, attempt to re-start under higher scrutiny/supervision with objective outcome measures. Just a thought

Y’all think there wouldn’t still be college house parties with straight men acting like apes if we got rid of frats?

not all frats are like that... I've never really gotten the whole pay to have friends, but they do connect you to people. Some are more specific to certain things like majors or careers. I've never been in a frat so I dont know that much, but a total ban on all frat life seems a bit ridiculous since some have nothing to do with dont haze and follow the rules perfectly fine.

I fucking wish.

As someone who was in a frat at vcu, a total ban is not necessary. Delta chi used to be a top tier frat but was known for heavily hazing their pledges they used to beat their pledges with phone books and just recently got reinstated which is vcus fault. Their are always dark horses, pike, fiji, theta chi, and pi kapp are examples of groups who put people through the process but aren’t hurting them.

Also let's arrest the fucking nazis who've been harassing the chabad house too?

No one even talks about the girl who was hit by the car though… but everyone is still talking about the straight white man who died. :/

Real answer is bringing back beer into the equation and limiting liquor. Liquor is 10x more dangerous to get drunk off of than beer

Social fraternities/sororities should probably be banned, or at least the ones that host parties involving any alcohol/drugs/etc. I’m in a coed professional fraternity that doesn’t sponsor or promote any use of alcohol since the main focus is professional development, so I’d hope that would be an exception in a hypothetical mass ban. I came into VCU knowing I didn’t want to join Greek life but ended up in this one by technicality lol

He was in my graduating class in high school- he was a really kind person. He hung out with the “popular” crowd while I was your stereotypical shy awkward kid with not a ton of friends, but even though we were part of two super different circles, he was always really sweet and nonjudgmental whenever I talked to him. We were never close, but he had a big impact on a kid who felt like they were invisible, and I hate that something so fucking unnecessary and cruel happened to such a genuinely good person.

You act like Greek life is some sort of training ground for ISIS.

If there were no office, who would keep them in check?

The real purpose is alumni fundraising

training men to abuse

It's so you don't get pregnant.

this isnt tiktok you can write the word rape

I don't know how I feel about them all being banned, but it's def not just one bad frat lol .. one has the nickname of the pike spikes ..

its like saying we should close every bar since some are sketchy.

How many people have chess clubs killed?

I dont think you understand what the terms wet and dry campus means. VCU is a dry campus because it doesnt provide alcohol at student events nor do they allow drinking in any of their dormitories even if you are above 21. Wet campus would be for example during Welcome Week at Casino night they provided alcohol for students if over the age of 21. Fraternities/Sororities, even though they are 100% associated with the school, throwing parties is not a VCU sponsored event so providing alcohol doesn't make VCU a wet campus, using that logic every college in the country would be wet campus. Now if a fraternity/sorority were providing alcohol at an official recruiting event that they have in the commons then that would definitely be a big no no because again VCU is a dry campus. You have to think of wet/dry campus as the actual institution providing or allowing drinking in school housing or at official school sponsored events or vice versa

Anyone can do what ever. The question should be asked if taxes/ tuition should be used for covering, funding and supporting organizations that have a long history of alleged issues and allegations not to mention a number of deaths.

I think most of them would agree that they wouldn’t be thriving in a greek environment 😂

What an odd story to tell when you are ostensibly defending frats

Plenty of people are talking about the girl who was hit. There was literally a news story today in local media. Adam Oakes came back up because his parents are hosting a remembrance next week. Not everything is about race my dude.

Come on bruh

Don’t get rid of collegiate athletics lol? Just because you don’t enjoy sports doesn’t mean everyone else feels the same way. It builds community and the people who play genuinely have a passion

Yea college athletics that provides jobs for the community (coaches, graphic designers, maintenence, IT professions, tradesmen, etc), gives students a chance at a free Bachelors or masters, and supports charities for cancer patients, people of color, women, military veterans, etc. Not to mention boosting student moral about VCU and networking with other VCU alumni. It's not perfect every so often someone gets into some bullshit but it's far from terrible.

They're gangs of men that use their power to terrorize people, especially women. They're less like isis. More like the cops.

There you go! See if they need a office to be kept in check... you have problems.

I think i got that down pack. I'm a dude.

I mean it’s difficult to know if it’s true or just people talking crap. When you see the degree of people that dislike frats and fraternity guys, it’s very easy to see people will make nicknames based off stereotypes and rumors rather than necessarily reality. Hell even within the sphere of Greek life another frat could easily make up a rumor in order to convince girls to go to their party and not the competition.

Should we ban the gym? The rock wall? Our lacrosse team? People get hurt all the time doing those things?

How many frats at VCU have actually killed someone? Lmao

Thanks for clarifying that, I acknowledge I misused the term dry campus. I’ll keep the original comment as is to keep this comment relevant

>Anyone can do what ever. idk i dont think gangs of young men should be allowed to rape and kill ¯⁠\⁠_⁠(⁠ツ⁠)⁠_⁠/⁠¯

Cuz everyone on this Reddit clearly isn’t in a frat. People think frats all about rape culture and paying for friends, when in reality their just like the popular groups we had in high school only bigger. Ive heard of multiple cases across all fraternities of any brother being accused of SA, and if the evidence is valid they are pretty much blacklisted from all Greek life. You guys can judge but don’t be mad when someone provides a different view

Am I wrong?

I hope you can learn to be less narrow minded ❤️

It’s clear this is something personal for you. I hope you can let go of the anger at some point.

There’s a Sonic open on campus :) Idk if there’s any sonic lovers here but there was a new one in construction and it just opened up today (right next to mojos, behind GRC) If you’re gonna go, socially distance, stay safe, and enjoy those great burgers and milkshakes :))

Their mozzarella sticks are the bomb.

Burgers? You gotta get the bacon egg and cheese breakfast toaster with tater tots and a slushy with nerds candy in it. Edit: slushy, not milkshake

I went there today. It was pretty nice.

What street is it on? I’m curious

Can I drive in?

I thought you were messing with me because I live over there and I would have seen one of those Sonic drivethrus but nope there's really a Sonic (without the drivethru)

can you walk there and order without a car?

Y’all should go to pita pit as well

Does anyone know the hours?

I believe most of not all Sonics have half priced drinks all day when you order through the app

that sounds super good gonna try it next time thank you!!!

For additional info, it's at the first floor of the new 805 W Lofts

No, pretty sure. Only cash/card. Maybe rambucks? Not sure though, but since it’s new I don’t think you can use rambucks just yet

No, it doesn’t have a drive thru

Yes! It’s walkable (I live right next to GRC) and there’s no drive in so you don’t really need a car. You can walk in and order. They have an indoor seating area too!

Oh and disregard the milkshake part, I meant to say slushy lol

Only at VCU 😭 GRC shenanigans

I love how this tradition hasn’t changed no matter the generation haha. We did this exact thing when I was there 10+ years ago

there was a window across from mine that had a cat in it and we made notes to tell the owners that we love the cat lol

hahah when i was a freshman 8 years ago we did the same thing, actually our class got in so much trouble that we got an email from the dean to take down the sticky notes or we'd all get strikes on our records lol. i made a big wiener in my window <3

Those damned vcu art students.(sarcasm)

wait that’s my dorm

acceptance !!! i know vcu takes almost everyone, but i got my acceptance letter today and i’m still really excited !! i’m a decent student (3.5 gpa, 8 aps, rho kappa) and i really don’t know why i was so worried about not getting into any of my colleges, but nevertheless getting my first acceptance letter was so exciting !!

Its always an exciting accomplishment to get admitted to college! Definitely feel proud and excited for yourself 💜🥳

Congratulations!! Sounds like you earned it!

amazing job!! ;)

when did you apply? congrats

Congratulations 🥳🥳🥳

Congratulations! What a great and optimistic post. I wish you to "cash out" well your future degree!

CONGRATS!!!

Congrats!!! It’s definitely exciting getting acceptance letters! I hope you have a great experience with wherever you choose to go :)

Congratulations!! I hope you enjoy VCU as much as I did :)

Congrats. Assuming you are in state, you now have a very affordable option. Good luck with the rest of your applications. Sounds like a good excuse to break out some ice cream!

Congrats 🎉🎉🎉

Congratulations 🎉

october 31 — i submitted all my applications that evening because i figured it’d be easiest to just knock out all of them when meeting the nov 1 deadline for some places.

thank you, i’m actually right outside of the city ! vcu is the closest school i applied to; also applied to jmu and tech. i definitely celebrated with a couple twix bars :)

VCU is more expensive than Tech. There’s nothing affordable about it.

did they send you an email? or was it through the portal? I submitted mine the same day haven't gotten a response yet! I thought they cane out April 1st 😓

i got it through the portal, i assume because it’s rolling people just get letters as they process them — but someone at admissions could probably tell you better than i can !

ahh okay that makes sense, I was just curious! congrats on your acceptance ✨️✨️

Reading Days VCU: "We canceled spring break but we're giving you reading days to make up for it!" My professors: "it's called a reading day so you better read" - and assign extra work... If you're behind, you're doomed...send help.

This no spring break is some type of bullshit Honestly, like most of the classes are online so let’s not act like this would be difficult to institute a spring break.

I have Wednesday online classes and even tho it’s a reading day today, my prof is still holding class...

yeah this is fucked. Florida is the move

most of my professors cancelled classes this week to give us some semblance of a spring break and i’ve still somehow managed to do more work this week than any other smh

I mean, I could go do homework from another location but if I took a week off my grades would go in the toilet

I'm sorry to hear that, it sucks. I have a pre recorded lecture to watch "at my leisure"

You’re saying that if you got a week off, then your grades would suffer?

Plus I doubt most people would actually be doing work if they went on spring break anyway. I’m tryna relax and have fun lol, not worry about class work.

Ohh, no, I thought you were telling me to take my own spring break and ignore work for a week.

Oh helllllll no, we’d all be fucked. I’m saying teachers acting like they can’t push this shit back a week because it’s soooo hard to change a canvas due date. I’ve never understood why some teachers deem it necessary to fuck kids in the ass with gargantuan amounts of work and others that respect our lives outside of school.

Ohh exactly! A couple of my classes are asking for extended due dates just to get a proper break! I understand that we have to fit a certain amount of work in the semester, but as long as we finish it, I wouldn't mind having a more heavily weighted week here or there or self pace the work to give myself a real break.

Ya seriously. My math professor says to the class yesterday, “Tomorrow is your last break for the remainder of the semester so don’t burn yourselves out.” As if that is up to us.

Totally up to us. Great. Woohoo. It's alright. A few weeks and it's over and we have summer...just gotta survive till then!

Pretty sure this is about the kid from VCU who died while rushing Delta Chi

Also gotta love the r/selfawarewolves -esque comments [like these ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Frat/comments/lu2ags/if_a_pledge_or_brother_gets_hurt_constantly_check/gp41jku/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3)

It is about a kid from VCU, his name was Adam Oakes. For some reason the reddit mods here deleted the post. Don't suppress this mods, Adam deserves to have his story told and for justice to be served. Someone's kid died because he wanted to make friends and rushed a frat, he didn't do anything wrong. He didn't deserve this, and honestly this could have happened to anyone at VCU. **I WANT JUSTICE** https://www.reddit.com/r/vcu/comments/lu0beu/alleged_vcu_frat_hazing_death/ The reddit post links to this twitter post https://archive.vn/cuUuN

haze with boots not booze

When was this?

Can do, thank you! And sorry for blaming you guys. It went from being a post to saying removed and that only normally happens when mods remove it.

Thought this would fit here for ppl in the dorms

*screams in poor*

I fucking knew this would happen

I been applying for multiple funding due to covid from vcu and then they hit me with the latest application requirements that I need to be attending summer / fall classes in 2020. Doesn’t really help if you’re a senior

How did they contact you?

I think they just sent me an email saying they havent got back to me bc of the high volume a few weeks later then i received a billing statement from vcu w a negative balance and my bank account then after an email saying something ab it, i forgot what exactly but I can look it up if you care

Were they able to offer you any assistance? Or should we just assume it's a bust at this point?

They offered me all the money I asked for, I applied relatively early, so maybe the issues are starting now that the funds are running dry since I’ve seen so many people complain about it. Just make sure you send them all the documentation they ask for and more, include a formal well written letter explaining your documentation and why you need the assistance including why you don’t have any documents they ask for. Edit: also by negative balance in my last message i mean they owed me money that’s how it reflects on your billing

Hands down the best professor at VCU

Be sure to say something to the chair of your department about how great this professor has been!!

He wishes everyone happy birthday on linkedin every year. great guy.

[So wholesome :’)](https://youtu.be/X2Qzc2-EBnY)

I met him once before. He’s the head of the Formula SAE team here.

Just chose VCU Mech E, entering for the class of 2024. Hope to have him as a professor soon! Seems like an awesome guy.

I had him his first year at VCU teaching. I believe he was also teaching at J. Sarge at the same time. Awesome all around guy!

He is my boss, and has shown more interest in my future and success than any other boss I have had to date. Great human being all together. 5 out of 5.

As the college takes your tuition and sends you into the corona dust bowl job market.

The struggle of trying to find somewhere quiet to study

Portable battery gang

Don’t forget the fourth factor. You also want to find a place to study where you won’t be noticed by the proselytizing evangelicals looking for converts to join their “church”. These people usually approach you in a very innocent way asking you if you can take their “survey”, so you think it’s for class or something, and then within about 5 minutes they end up trying to pray with or for you.

Fourth floor cabell library if you want somewhere quiet.

Or even trying to find a clean table sometimes! I can’t count how many times I’ve almost put my laptop or notebook in someone else’s old lunch

If noise really distracts you I'd also consider purchasing some noise cancelling headphones. Dont even have to connect em to music if it distracts you. Also causes people to leave you alone.

Keep a power strip in your backpack. People don't seem to mind sharing outlets when you're also providing an extra outlet for their phone. Tempted to bring a power strip and a six-foot heavy-duty extension cord and sit wherever the heck I want. I wish someone would make some little signs -- "The 4th Floor is a for Quiet Study. Continue your conversation in the lobby" by the entrance to the 4th floor. When people do the extended whisper conversation, you could just walk over and hand them a note. Print them on yellow paper so it's like getting a yellow card in soccer.

4th floor of MCALC is also really quiet. Take the elevator up and head to your right. Follow the hallway all the way to the back. There’s a couch back there too if you ever need some rest.

Engineering school study rooms

I could sign you as a guest in GRC. PM me.

That shit is annoying.

Wat. I've never seen this, where is this. Edit: Well i mean outside yes I've seen them but it's usually pretty obvious they're with a church.

It's really busy though, and there are still people whispering to each other in the large room. If you want any privacy you need to reserve a room. The problem with the room is that you only get it for 2 hours and you can hear people having normal volume conversations through the walls. I know I am nitpicking but I find it extremely annoying and try to avoid going there if possible.

I get it. There’s also the third floor of Mcalc. It’s the social work floor. We’re a small department so there are few people. It’s where I would go if I lived on campus.

I didn't know about that! I just found that SEAO lets students use their office and its really quiet. I like it a lot. I also use the top floor of the engineering building

Yeah! There’s also outlets near the tables and some comfy chairs to sit on. There’s also large tv’s if you want to hook up your computer. Pretty sure you can use them. People might look at you funny but I don’t see why not. Now you have another option!

Did I miss something? I’m a virtual student but live in the area. I received this email and I’m confused. Did I miss something important?? Is this related to *last week?*

My theory is that it’s due to all the threats other universities have gotten after the Charlie Kirk shooting, but I could be wrong. Very sad that we’re living in such evil times

Students being lynched in ga probably had something to do with it along with the threats after the kirk shooting

I agree that I think it’s just generally related to the recent threats at universities, but I think there could have been a bit of a preamble so that people weren’t left wondering if there was a specific threat to VCU…

It is in partly a response to multipule medical students getting robbed walking to the hospital in the mornings

I was wondering what happened too

We received a similar email over here (I’m a downtown vcuhealth staff member). Glad someone asked; I was also wondering what might have prompted it.

Same I saw it. Theres just been some accidents in the past week and that might that’s what I assumed but the head campus security makes me wonder lol

They send a similar mess every single year.

An email was sent to faculty from the governor's office telling them to shut up about Kirk (or else). The police email is to freak the students out of protesting VCUs complacency.

It started with HBCU’s receiving threats. I am alum. Graduated 2013. My freshmen dorm doesn’t even exist anymore. (GRC) This is sad. But also a canned response. From even a decade ago. When Obama won etc.

VCU started increasing its police presence especially when trump increased police presence in D.C. As a student I’ve lived on campus for years, VCU has always aligned itself with Trumps views. I feel the recent death of Kirk is also apart of this but the increased presence of police here picked up before this as well.

So when is it officially civil war?

Love seeing emails written by ChatGPT 💀

Waiting for more students to be expelled for acting on their liberal views while celebrating openly about the death of Charlie Kirk. Police are the enforcement of the elected officials that govern each locality. Behave children before expulsion.

it was in mississippi

That was an unwell person committing suicide via hanging, not someone “lynched” …

In front of One Capitol Square no less

happens to the employees as well , been like this for a while idk why they haven’t taken pro-cautions to fix this

I saw something recently about how we (the country as a whole) are too lazy to start a civil war and tbh, I agree… I think it’ll be a digital civil war and that feels like it has already begun. Look at the idiots doxxing and getting people fired.

Not chatgpt, this is the same email they’ve been using since like 2015 when I was in school.

Where do you think gpt learns it from though 💀

Two wrongs don’t make a right, however it is important to note that CK called for the death of thousands and celebrated the death of many in his spoken and written words. His career was based around inciting violence with divisive rhetoric. It is all out there and can be found with a simple internet search. This whole situation is a mess and the federal and state overreaching response is alarmingly fascist (just look up the definition and you will see our country is following that playbook step by step).

i mean, all of the schools that i heard of getting bomb/shooting threats were hbcus, hard to see how that’s not a direct response to the kirk shooting

Did anyone see where this man fell? Because that limb would've cracked the second he went out on it

black people don’t hang themselves off trees in the forest

found the yt apologist

Yep, I know a couple of nurses that have been held at gun point and gotten carjacked.

That is so valid. Found some interesting facts: 1) civil wars in America are not officially declared. The president can issue the Insurrection act, but neither congress nor the president can declare war on the people. It’s determined that a civil war previously happened, not announced that it is happening 2) they consist of two+ sustained and organized opposing groups [one side being the government] 3) goal is to assume control over the state or nation, not simply riot/protest 4) 1,000 battlefield deaths must occur to rule out political unrest. With all of that I’d say the daily/weekly massacres, senator executions, “political public figure” assassination, assassination attempts on the president, murder by police, all the cyber warfare you pointed towards, and talks of murdering all the mentally ill homeless people seem to be pretty on par with the criteria 😶 I don’t even want to know what we don’t know. I feel like if we are in a civil war though, and it’s a very “metro vs rural” civil war, not a simple “north vs south” civil war

Can confirm, they've always been formatted in concise bullet points like this.

And any school that has a reputation for being “liberal” majority. I’m in the social work masters program but we have alot of curriculum on the history of racism, misogyny, homophobia and oppression in general. Now of course it matters that we’re a social work program lol but even some of the other programs that people I know are apart of have been having a lot of conversations about what is going on in the world and I haven’t seen many that agree with it. I’ve met several die hard republican students that said they were uncomfortable claiming it because of how badly the extremist have painted the party. So if these extremist are students talking about what is being said, I’m thinking maybe schools that have spoken up against it are also being targeted. Just my opinion tho I’m not on campus regularly so it could be something else.

Such a sad(but true) commentary on country in which we live. The far right(wrong?!) are not able to abide by the thought that women and minorities need to have seats at the same table, occupied since the founding of our nation, in order that we truly form, "a more perfect union". The charlie kirks of that gang need reassurance that the old guard white boys network will still hold sway as the white race shrinks.

Especially publically.

man what the fuck is wrong with people 😭

Oh yeah, that one. Delete.

while I'm glad to see a public servant realizing they answer to us, this is not fucking it otherwise. ugh

Excellent points. I’m just tired of living through one “unprecedented” after another and if in 20 years I read about this time, right now, being a part of Civil War Pt. Deuces… I’m not even sure I’ll be allowed to read by then so idk what I’ll do.

Dont disopoint your 8 million bosses (even though most of them aren't nazi sympathizers. Like that vest wearing dummy, or that no tip butter allergy university president).

The fact the VCU library is not going back to 24 hours is a shame.

I've always been a big advocate of 24-7 hours for Cabell, at least during the last month of the semester. You can still just feel that there are fewer people on campus and in the library. I'm sure they've cut staffing as a result. Not sure what's the solution because Cabell 24/7 is a godsend for folks who have a crappy roommate / living situation. Wish VCU would staff an alternative 24 hour study space. They could use one of the commons ballrooms, the ones right at the top of the stairs in the foodcourt?

First Week of Class Good luck to everyone this week!

Correction: last week of class

we all gon die

Came here for this

“You’re not concerned that’ll put your health at risk?” “No it will. But I wanna party.” Scum.

Literally had no shame. But who can blame the person? The college DLC is really hyped up to be party city and class of 2024 is not getting that unfortunately

Lol I just watched this and there are dozens more with that same mindset

Are you talking about those spring breakers in Miami vid or is there another vid?

Thats cute thinking they will graduate in 4 years.

Why do you even have to ask

Recent news. Wait for the last person https://twitter.com/sierra8news/status/1294162932859731968?s=21

You stay classy, Temple building

Natty Nice, the classiest.

I would say that's mine, but I didn't show up for class this week. I'm the epitome of Lazy College Senior.

Hate to be that guy, but... Come on, VCU. A world-renowned university should not have grammar or spelling mistakes in their official websites. "Apart" and "a part" mean very different things, please someone update this.

and its the biggest text too, clearly they got a new design guy

I had applied for the position that covers this and didn't get the job, despite always checking over my professional copy.

What?! Spell check came back clean!!! 😂😂😂

world-renowned is generous. nonetheless, not surprised by this lmao

honestly wouldn’t be surprised if it was AI VCU uses so much ai

World renowned is a wild thing to say lmao

Honestly you should follow up on that email thread

This is a serious problem especially with how aggressively VCUArts recruits only to throw us to the wolves and offer no support after graduation. I only found out after graduation that the average earnings are like $27k which is literally just a retail salary.

That's a whole different issue, especially if AI hasn't been trained on grammar, spelling and orher language basics as a baseline.

There wasn't supposed to be any charge even five years ago. VCU has been actively getting more expensive.

VCU is now claiming that students attacked officers with nondescript "chemical spray"....

The claim that the officers didn't use tear gas sounds pretty inaccurate to me

Also, VCU PD is lying; tear gas was definitely deployed last night

If you look up what’s constitutes an unlawful assembly you’ll quickly find out that the definition is VERY loose and can be applied WAY too liberally (as is likely the case last night). There are many issues with what happened last night, a lot of them are in legislation (both the Youngkin directive and the legal definition of an unlawful assembly). I know it’s frustrating to hear over and over, but voting IS important and things like last night should NOT happen and we can lessen the chances of it happening in the future with “good” legislation and leadership.

I would love to see what proof the cops have for those bogus claims compared to the hundreds of videos from dozens different angles that were taken by the students and others who were there

Don’t let them try and change the narrative, there’s plenty of videos and witnesses to what actually happened

show us the body cam footage then

VCU has cameras everywhere. This could easily be confirmed by video. But don’t expect to see it if it doesn’t fit the narrative wanted by VCU administrators.

I heard somewhere that it’s basically just vcu covering it’s ass, basically saying yeah maybe VCU police didn’t use any tear gas, but RPD and VSP sure did.

Cops probably used pepper spray and aimed it at themselves instead. Or the wind blew it back into their faces. What a group of cartoons lol

They need to show the footage or pipe down.

the truth is out there, its not like every second of this event wasn't filmed and uploaded or live streamed from about 150 different angles. just search VCU protest on twitter. there isn't enough time in the day to hit every account.

Do they think there isn't video?

https://x.com/samuelparkerrtd/status/1785111802289832027?s=46&t=bGEVONddSV_OcftbcnVJTw this video shows tear gas smh

Me and a few of my friends got tear gassed last night, we’re analyzing the remnants on our clothes in one of the chemistry labs. One of the perks of being a stem student

Probably trying to steer away from admitting to it after the debacle where they got sued for launching tear gas during the BLM protests and they had to walk back all their “violent protestors” claims on Twitter and the police chief stepped down soon after https://x.com/RichmondPolice/status/1542974646009700355

VCU didn’t use it; VSP did

It's carefully worded to imply that no teargas was used, while not being 100% incorrect as long as you interpret it that VCU Police themselves did not use teargas. There are a couple of other instances of clever wording there.

Also I think they're blaming the protestors for the cop who was sprayed by... Another cop...

It’s not a full lie, it’s like a half truth. They are wrong in the sense there was tear gas. They are telling the truth when they say VCU PD didn’t deploy it. VSP deployed the tear gas.

considering there /can't/ be laws to prevent the use of the first amendment, there weren't laws broken. public spaces are just that, public spaces. unless there is a curfew involved, or some other ostensible reason as to why people can't be in that public space, then there is no law that prevents people from protesting. this was not a violent protest. there wasn't any violence until the police showed up either.

as a citizen u also have the right to protest Without being arrested or gassed 😮

All I see is pepper spray in that video...

That specific video doesn’t but there are other videos that do show tear gas. Nonetheless, spraying any form of chemical towards peaceful students is unacceptable

If tear gas is positive pls send this to the news

please keep me posted on this

they didn't report it being used!

I fully support the cause behind the protests, and I stand with those exercising their right to peaceful assembly. However, when demonstrations escalate into violence, vandalism, or trespassing, it ceases to be a productive form of protest and becomes a disruption to the community. While I empathize with the frustrations fueling such actions, we must recognize that they undermine the integrity of the cause and necessitate police intervention. Let’s uphold the spirit of peaceful protest while remaining mindful of the consequences of crossing that line.

Where? I’d like to see the video

same, reply to me when you find out

There's a fair distinction on the effects and long term symptoms! Pepper spray may lead to blindness and will cause chemical burns where tear gas is an abortifacient, will cause you to vomit/tear up. Both were used last night

I’m trying to FOIA the body cam footage but idk the cost yet

Annnddddd guess who made it violent.

At 1:24 here https://twitter.com/GoadGatsby/status/1785112806980747488?t=qnAfK9egV8wlDnkdVNg1bA&s=19

I took down my post. I was being very ignorant and has mis information as well.

Just got accepted into VCU!!! It was my top school choice! Maybe I’ll see some of y’all next year.

Congrats!! I came into VCU determined I would transfer but i was so wrong I love it here and the people are amazing. Your gonna have a blast 🤩

Does VCU do rolling admissions? Just wondering because I have a friend who applied. Congrats!!!

Yay, congrats!!

Congratulations!! I love it here ^-^ it was my top choice as well

Congrats!! I’m still waiting for my decision for fall 2022 ahhhh

hey!! Just got accepted yesterday! I’m gonna be a psych major . Hit me up !!

That acceptance letter feeling is great until college fucks you up and you just slowly become jaded. But congrats nonetheless. Your freshman year will always be the best year

Congrats! I've been going crazy waiting on my spring 2022 transfer decision. When did you apply?

congrats!!!!

Congrats!!!! Welcome to the ramily 💛

i applied 10/5 and still haven’t heard back??

yes they do

I applied rolling, yeah

omgd i applied for psych major waiting on the letter ahhh

accepted as well ❗️

Applied early october

I applied for spring in August and haven't heard anything back. I'm not sure they actually know what rolling admissions means.

Omg yay !! Hit me up

definitely, dm me

I applied like October 03 or smth. Did you apply rolling?

Classes are kicking my dick college is hard

same and it’s only the 3rd week of classes rip

i thought i was doing ok bc im getting less assignments than last semester and then i checked my grade for my first test...jesus im fucked

Glad I'm not alone on this

make sure it's not a class that accumulates total points instead of an average. Accounting was like that for me, just counts up points on assignments and tests.

[https://youtu.be/ndL7y0MIRE4?t=95](https://youtu.be/ndL7y0MIRE4?t=95)

I faff around too much since everything is remote. The courses haven’t kicked my ass (yet) but it will come. I’m emotionally dead inside.

you're not alone bud, ironically I did a ton of work for my bio class only to get a 64 on the test

I know everyone says this and it doesn’t make it feel any better, but you’re not alone. struggling is normal when you basically have to change everything about the way you’re used to learning. I wish you better luck in the next weeks though!

Better kicking your dick than kicking your balls.

Ground and pound to my privates as well.

What'd you get on it?

Is the semester over yet

if i had a table to myself at cabell maybe i would actually study

Hearing my own breathing on the 4th floor makes me anxious

Book a room

Fresh out, we got loud ass table with five people at best. Fuck Cabell.

2 hours later: "Hey uh I had this room reserved"

Two hours is better than no hours

I made a meme

Do those things ever actually happen? I’ve been going to VCU for over two years and I have never in my life heard one of those siren drills.

i think ive heard like 2 in 3 years so yes but depending on your schedule you could just miss em entirely

Yes, I hear every single one. But you’re only supposed to hear them outside. They don’t have them inside buildings cause that’s what those loud AF Alertus boxed are for.

WOOOOOO GUESS WHO GOT DOUBLE THE QUESADILLAS FOR FREE Twisted taco for life(im gonna throw up if i eat more quesadillas)

I cant tell if yall are joking. Ive never seen food look so unappetizing in my life

That looks solidly white

My mouth taste dry just from looking at this

Twisted became mid the moment I was unable to order a plain cheese quesadilla

Wtf is this crap

Personally I think you got the double quesadillas for free, idk tho

Sad ahh quesadilla

Is it even cooked?

I'm Mexican, and I'm deeply offended by this 😭

This shit was awful and they just gave it bc the other guy didnt pick up his order

Cherry trees at peak the other day by Harris and commons

Nice! Miss the campus so much :(

Are these Cherry Blossoms? They are beautiful and I love to look at them, but they are awfully white.

Aren’t those Bradford pears?

Best time of year on campus. Miss it

Yup, one type of them

Not exactly a tree expert here, personally, tbh. I just assumed they were cherry trees. If anyone wants to correct me, though, go right om ahead.

Lol i always thought they were bc of how bad it smells walking past them on a hot day 🤢

Oh wow that's really cool! Thank you for sharing. I'm gonna appreciate them even more now.

mourning the loss of 24hr cabell :’( any of you remember pre-covid when cabell being open 24 hours was a given, except for fridays and weekends (i think) ? and during finals, even the starbucks was open 24 hours. vcu “extending” hours during finals to close at 3 am instead of 2 am is so cheap. there was something so empowering about absolutely crushing a paper until the sun came up. i’m currently at the library and having to leave at 3 is going to kill the momentum that i’ve built. genuinely at the very least they could be open 24hrs during finals season instead of all year. on that note… are there any campus buildings accessible all the time? i’m in need of any workspace that isn’t my apartment. i’m assuming all of the buildings with classrooms are locked this late.

I was just thinking about this as well. :(

Isn’t this like a basic function of a university? Surely we could fire one administrator and fund 24-hour operation for the main campus library

I too remember the 'glory days' of nocturnal paper-writing fueled by the ever-burning lights of Cabell. Yet, I discovered a curious artifact during my academic excavations — a strategy so ancient it might as well have been etched in stone. It suggests the radical notion of 'daily effort,' a mysterious ritual involving short, 30-minute daily sessions that somehow reduces stress by a factor of 1,000. While the adrenaline rush of a last-minute marathon is the stuff of legends, this arcane practice of consistent work might just be magical enough to keep one's sanity intact till dawn :)

Student housing is a joke. If you’re considering coming to VCU and living in student housing just be aware you’ll consistently be breathing in black mold!! :)

Look, the 2nd most important job of a university is to build new buildings. Nobody said anything about maintaining them. The 1st most important job, of course, is intercollegiate sports

how the fuck is this able to keep going on? like genuinely, a class action lawsuit needs to be filed by students who have had adverse health effects from this.

Hello, I have sticky this post as this is the 3rd post in a bit about potential mold or something that. [https://www.reddit.com/r/vcu/comments/xrtdbc/mold\_problem\_in\_the\_dorms/](https://www.reddit.com/r/vcu/comments/xrtdbc/mold_problem_in_the_dorms/) Another post was made about potential mold. There is was good information about mold in general and landlord tenant laws. Here is the CDC information about mold [https://www.cdc.gov/mold/default.htm](https://www.cdc.gov/mold/default.htm) Ineedlawnwork left this comment: [https://www.reddit.com/r/vcu/comments/xrtdbc/comment/iqgv3ux/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/vcu/comments/xrtdbc/comment/iqgv3ux/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) &#x200B; >Saw this comment in another thread. I am not a lawyer and this should not be taken as legal advise. Your landlord owes you a safe place to live that means no mold. https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/virginia-rules-regarding-mold-rental-properties.html Read this. You must send them your landlord in writing to send notice notice to start the clock. https://oag.dc.gov/sites/default/files/2018-02/Sample-Mold-Notice-Letter.pdf You can find other sample letters online. Short and sweet. Send your land lord a email with photos, video's, letting them know you see mold or suspect mold. Ask them about where they plan on relocating you Ask they to pay for a hotel or provide you a new place to live while they fix your residences. Ask them to conduct a mold test an an sample to determine if the room is safe. Ask them to preform mold remediation so they are not in breach of the land lord landlord tenant law. When you send a email email CC everyone under the sun. then send a certified to who ever your landlord is. Everyone person you CC can be called into court if it ends up there. You also might want to get a lawyer involved now if you have found mold. The following is information you should review. Ask them to respond immediate. https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title8.01/chapter3/section8.01-226.12/ "Notice" means notice given in writing by either regular mail or hand delivery, with sender retaining sufficient proof of having given such notice, which may be either a United States postal certificate of mailing or a certificate of service confirming such mailing prepared by the sender. However, a person shall be deemed to have notice of a fact if he has actual knowledge of it, or he received a verbal notice of it. A person "notifies" or "gives" a notice or notification to another by taking steps reasonably calculated to inform another person whether or not the other person actually comes to know of it. If a notice given is not in writing, the person giving the notice has the burden of proof to show that the notice was given to the recipient of the notice. https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/environmental-health/public-health-toxicology/mold/ Mold can be bad for your heath. General Information Health Effects from Mold Exposure Some people are affected by the presence of mold while others can live in places with a large amount of mold and not experience any symptoms. Allergic reaction is the most commonly reported health effect of mold exposure. If you cough, wheeze, or have difficulty breathing around mold, you may be sensitive to certain molds. If continuously exposed to mold, some people may develop symptoms such as watery, itchy, burning or red eyes; nose or throat irritation; sneezing; coughing or wheezing; constant headaches; memory problems or mood changes; aches and pains; and in some cases, hives, welts, or skin rash. Mold spores cannot be seen but can be inhaled, which can cause irritation or infection in the lungs and make it harder to breathe. Those who are more likely than others to develop symptoms from mold exposure include young children, the elderly, pregnant women, and people with asthma or other respiratory diseases. People with suppressed immune systems (e.g. HIV/AIDs infection, organ transplant patients, chemotherapy patients) should avoid heavy mold infestations. If possible, susceptible individuals should not live in buildings where mold is growing, and should consult their family physician if symptoms develop or persist. Black Mold One species of mold (Stachbotrys chartarum), known as black mold, may cause more serious health effects to people who are sensitive to mold. For more information, you can view our Freqently Asked Questions about Black Mold document here. So here we are. OP please let us know what happens.

omg what building

Man, you should have seen GRC 1 and 2 before they got taken down. Place was a petri dish in more ways than one

i lived in GRC (recently moved out) and i’d start violently coughing everytime i stepped in there

Why the mold gotta be black tho? 🙇‍♂️

How do I get somone to check mine? I’m in west grace north

What building???

mannn, i was really considering attending vcu what is this

Unless it has to do with Engineering or basketball, the university doesn’t give a single fuck

Im already having health effects from it. But hundreds of people at different universities have tried suing over this same issue and they lose every time. Also find it comical how grace and broad residents were forced to move all of our stuff out over the summer so they could do maintenance. Like wtf maintenance was done ???

Grace and broad.

Yeah I've heard GRC is really bad

GRC has only been around for like 5 years. How did it get that bad already!?

It’s absurd bruh

Idk but i want it out of my apt and airways 💀

U could call maintenance and ask if they can check. My dad drove to Richmond and brought a ladder to look for me tho cause I had found mold on ceiling in my bathroom

Sports bring in a lot more money than any other department can. VCU seems to be loading up to build a football field with their new plan for the sports complex in Scott’s Addition.

same shit in rhoads

1 or 2? Or are both likely infected

really? i live here and i havent had any mold issues (though one of our vents is very dusty🙄)

The old GRC, talking like the one built in the 60's. That one is gone now; no experience with the new one.

exactly!!!! ikr i thought the same but the upper floors have mold worse :(

Thats....That's..... Understanding 😁

Yikes ok thanks

I think that comment boils down to,1) since it's a complaint about student housing it's likely the first place someone has lived outside of their parent/guardians home, thus "kids" or new to the world of rentals 2) while others are very right you to have a legal right to a clean rental, the fact this is coming out in October as opposed to pre-move in means the university is unlikely to be held legally responsible for damages as long as it's addressed quickly (within the legally prescribed time) 3) this is a lesson learned for the majority of housing you'll be able to afford during school and for a decade or so after... For-profit housing (and unfortunately non-profit housing) put as little money in to maintenance as possible often ascribing to the old adage "it's better to ask forgiveness than permission" + "a dose of prevention is cheaper than an ounce of cure"(the prevention is the lease agreement saying you're responsible to tell them if they missed something) which = more money for the landlord. If you don't check before you move in, they're off the hook (in most cases) and most people don't tear out the air vents before moving in... There's a reason VCU is putting out studies linking social violence to "slum lord's". Sure student housing isn't "great" but wait till you compare it to your other options Please don't take this as victim blaming, unless you have a trust fund, most of us have been there and feel the same rage... Unfortunately the great American corporation favors the business over the plebian and the laws reflect that.

I mean like go off I guess. But maybe if VCU spent less time getting scammed out of half a million dollars and more time maintaining healthy living conditions they wouldn’t be getting shat on so much.

The vents in my living room were 100% times worse. Start taking pictures of everything!!! Document document document.

I would say both are likely infected, from comments I’ve read on other posts seem like all dorms have this issue. Mold is to be expected, especially in a dorm. But the fact that the walls are starting to rot is just not acceptable. Especially for how expensive housing is.

Have you looked inside ur vents though? Cause the only reason I discovered just how bad it was was by taking vent covers off.

ohhhh, yeah that would make sense

I understand where you're coming from and I hear what you're saying, I certainly don't have a trust fund, and I know others understand how frustrating this is. Mold is common, and even more common in dorms. However, less than a year ago a freshman housing hall was shut down due to toxic black mold. VCU has been in the media and received complaints about mold and unsafe living conditions for decades, and it's never properly addressed. I've reported mold to housing in the past, and all that was done was them wiping it off with a dry paper towel. On top of that, several housing halls with 12-month leases were required to move everything out over the summer so they could do "deep cleaning and maintenance." Yet, the wall surrounding my air vent is visibly rotting due to mold. So, that means one of two things, either they 1. Actually addressed the mold, and it grew and developed to this state in the span of two months. 2. The mold was never addressed over the summer, or they just did a spot clean/painted over it. I knew what I was getting into when signing up for student housing. But I also pay $5,000 a year to live here and expect safe living conditions. My health has been severely affected by this as I have a mold allergy. I hope I'm not coming across as entitled or snotty in this post. I'm just extremely frustrated.

I mean yeah, I was just saying personally I’d prefer sports over adequate living conditions football>

That was 2014. NCAA landscape has changed so much since then. Having a football team also completely changes the dynamic of the school as well. I wish there was a study looking at depression rates at d1 football schools vs non football schools. Also even if that sport loses money, the university will get more publicity and in turn ends up helping their academic departments as well.

Question: how do you know it’s mold? As a landlord, I’ve had tenants complain about the black on vents. I got it tested and it wasn’t mold. I think for like $50 you can get it tested at the place across the street from PBR - Schneider labs? It’s bright blue building on the corner.

i cant reach my vents in my room at least :( i’ve been in this room for 2 years w no issues so hopefully they actually cleaned when they said they did this summer. i am gonna go submit a maintenance request to get the really dirty one fixed!!

You're not coming across snotty or entitled at all... But I can see youthful and optimistic 😁. The fact that they shut down and relocated students points to the university attempting to address the problem (whether they did or not is uncertain as you stated), spot cleaning and repainting with a fungicidal paint is a common remediation technique, and if you think your vents are bad for a place your paying 5,000 a year for just wait till you see the vents and state of the rest of the apartment in a rental in a similar location (though not as prime) that you pay 8k to 14k for. Again I'm not saying you don't have a right to be upset, you do, document everything and rage against the machine... When the machine spits out the same bullshit it has for decades then it's time to buckle down, understand the parts of the machine that work and the parts that are broken, and use this frustration (and the frustration to come) to fuel the effort that's required to fix it. If you figure out another way feel free to keep me in the loop!

LMAO what??? Please look up the effects of long term mold exposure. I’ve had recurrent tonsillitis that’s resistant to antibiotics, severe rashes, tingling/numbness in hands and feet, and much more. This shit can literally cause psychosis, MCAS, mood disorders, cancer, etc.

Just because you have a sports team doesn't mean it's generating publicity/revenue in a meaningful way, especially enough to outweigh the costs. Your team really has to be consistently near the top; which most aren't. The vast majority of programs are going to be huge financial drags on the University; picking on Football, just think of the amount of coaches, support staff, scholarships, building maintenance, travel, etc that it goes in to field a team. Unless you are playing on a big TV network every week, you aren't coming close to breaking even. Ever. Even schools like Virginia Tech and UVA subsidize their Athletics departments with student dollars. They suck now, but both these programs used to be consistently good, and their basketball teams are both pretty good. I'm not sure what is exactly helping an academic department. Faculty certainty aren't choosing which school to teach at based on it's sporting team; they're choosing 100% based on pay, location, and if they're able to do their research/get tenure. These are academics after all. Maybe enrollment? But once again, making a huge assumption on publicity and popularity of sports. I like watching some sports, but not everyone does, and a lot of people don't watch at all. I mean hell, I'd say a very sizeable chunk of VCU's student body doesn't give a shit about the basketball team. I'd bet if we did have football even fewer would care about that.

I know it’s mold because I did a mold test kit from the air vent and it grew an entire colony. Its funny you mention it, I’m actually taking my mold kit to Schneider labs tmr to get it tested. Also, VCU has had horrendous black mold issues in the dorms and academic buildings for decades. They just don’t care to actually address the issue.

Lol I seem to remember, oh so many years ago, every room on my floor had removed their fire alarms, wrapped them up in sheets and shoved them under a pile of clothes in their closets...I'm pretty sure there were a few skunks living on the 16th floor too... 🤷😂

Yeah I had to use a 6ft ladder to get to mine :/ That’s another reason I’m so pissed off though because why did they make us move all of our stuff out over the summer only for me to come back with vents looking like this ??

its a joke, calm down

Let us know what your test comes out to in a new post on RVA subreddit I’m guessing it will be positive but would like to know and let others know. Afterwards, contact CBS6 “on your side” or whatever news station does that stuff! They’d be all over this Edit: I have a buddy who works for them… maybe he can help. You just gotta get all your ducks in a row - witnesses, tests, pics, etc. to make it a serious thing for them to pursue.

Nothin about this situation is funny but thx

Oh trust me I’m doin all of the above.

For the first time in my life got above a 3.5 for a semester Was considered "gifted" as a kid, but ever since middle school my grades had always been mediocre to subpar. Never failing but ended highschool with a 2 .7 I thought I would change in college but a whole bunch of different things like laziness and general isolation always made it hard to feel motivated to improve, I mean, I got into college so what's the point of trying to go above and beyond right? I told myself I was satisfied even if I didn't reach to what my goals were. So for a solid 3 years if I got at least a 3.0 I patted myself on the back said "good enough" But idk if it's the fact I'm graduating next year, or that I finally am starting to get an idea of what I want for my life but I got a real fire this semester to try and actually push myself for the first time since I was like 11. And it ended up with me getting a 3.8. It honestly feels like a rush I haven't felt before and it makes me not wanna go back to that sense of satisfaction I had before. I don't wanna say I've "leveled up" but damn it feels good to give it you best and succeed. So if anyone needs a story to give them a fire to try you best, take this one :)

We have similar stories. G&T all throughout my life, but I stopped giving a shit in middle school, when the bullying got bad and the schoolwork extra dull. Graduated HS with a 2.8. Never learned how to study, so college was a shock. I failed 8am Astronomy my first semester, despite having taken it in high school; that kicked my ass into high gear. Was on the dean’s list every semester after that, and graduated with honors. Good work, and keep it up!

Definitely had some gifted kid burnout as well, but it wasn’t until college that I finally accepted I wouldn’t get an A in everything and honestly it felt really good. Some of my worst grades are actually the classes I enjoyed and learned the most from. That being said I just finished a 4.0 semester and it does still feel pretty good lol.

If a university professor’s entire class structure consists of fill-in-the-blank worksheets and Netflix, should they still have a job? I'm studying Homeland Security, and I've now taken two classes that used the same Netflix documentary and textbook excerpts. One of them was an upper-level course. At this point, the quality of education feels nonexistent. I'm paying $8,000 for this semester, and tuition has doubled. I don’t receive financial aid or student loans, and I worked my ass off to afford this $2,000 class-- watching Netflix. I want my money back. I'm honestly considering opening a Go-Fund-Me to get my money back. I could spend it on a Netflix gift card and popcorn.

honestly, I would make sure to include this in the course evals

Education as a whole is going into the gutter tbh

I’m not in the homeland security program, but I’m also dealing with an adjunct professor who so far has also been nothing but lazy and unprofessional in their teachings. I don’t feel like I’m learning anything, and I don’t feel like the school cares as long as they’re getting their paycheck. It really really sucks that we have to go through this. Why is VCU hiring so many people who are just in it for the paycheck and not to teach?

Would probably be worth switching majors, I don't think "homeland security" is gonna be used for anything good for the next few years.

No, I will not really open a Go-Fund-Me.

Adjuncts make about $3k per semester per class.

Email your professor now and don’t wait to put it in the evals. Give them a human chance to address your needs.

course eval!! and put this on ratemyprofessor

VCU is a business first and a college second. I went from 2009-2016 with a gap that lasted two years in between. So I can’t really speak on what it’s like now.

I would say something to someone. Could you go to the department head? This is just a suggestion, but if it were me, I would supplement your course work with books from the library. That way you don't end up hindered once you get to the job market.

Ahhh America

I know some other professors who shouldn't have a job for basically the same behavior("go look at some tutorials, I can't help you").

Have you thought about or inquired as to why you're covering the same materials in multiple classes? Have you asked what learning outcomes these instructors are meeting? Or are you just sitting there and complaining? If I was spending $8k and feeling like I wasn't getting my money's worth, I wouldn't be complaining on reddit. I'd be figuring out wtf. Don't talk about it, be about it.

So you mind telling me the classes?

When I got my BA in HS&EP the program was great. I heard they got rid of all the professors with field experience and hired academics. It’s sad to see this is where the program has gone

Is the issue that two professors used the same content? In that instance, maybe the classes are related or cover similar topics, so perhaps the content is relevant for both. Most professors don’t confer in detail with each other on every single item/assignment. They may not even realize two of them are using it in a similar manner, unless they shared it with each other and in that case it’s probably intentional because they like it so much. Or is the issue that they are showing videos entirely in lieu of teaching? We’re 3ish weeks into the semester. Was it just 1 class so far this term or a repeated issue? Interspacing videos, questions, discussions, exercises, and other items is an age old education method that goes back to your elementary school years. They do it to keep you awake and/or vaguely interested because honestly when I sit in class about 1/3 of the students are half asleep and another 1/3 are just playing on their phone/laptop. Anything that breaks up a monotonous lecture is usually welcome to me.

What course is it? I'm HSEP as well.

I was a homeland security major and had a ton of great professors. I would bring this up with the department chair and definitely make sure you mention it on your course evaluations.

Me as a professor

Adjunct professors get payed less than Costco cashiers. They are also really smart people. Effort in (pay) = effort out (course quality).

homeland security=round up all the people we don't like and throw em into jail

who’s ur prof, i’m the same major

They now make just under $4200 (at least in the College of Humanities & Sciences)... It's still peanuts compared to hiring full-time faculty, but quite a bit more than the $3k they made when I started working at VCU

They cut costs by replacing expensive tenured track positions with adjunct positions that are basically rent a teacher.

No lecture. Every week the assignment is to watch a Netflix episode and complete a worksheet.+ a reading every other week. It is a five episode series. There's also a single 1,000-word essay and in the other class we we did the exact same reading and (although only instructed to skim it) and completed a crossword puzzle. And we only watched the first episode of the Netflix series. Together, that comes to $4,000 worth of Netflix.

Don't use names. This is not just a private chat with your classmates. 22,000 people have seen this post. People are crazy and violent. Edit the name out. Also, that's a completely different problem. You describe your class as being 'content heavy' In my class, the information is not there. Everyone is getting A's. The upper-level classes do not provide the rigor expected of sixth-grade classes. Our textbook is a novel and the only other major source material for the class is a Netflix documentary. That documentary only covers one major event. This is across classes and with different professors. My diploma will just be a piece of paper if I don't get some harder classes than this.

Yeah, I was gonna say, adjuncts make about 16-20 an hour depending on how much prep and grading they're doing. The job requires about 6-10 years of education and 3+ years of teaching experience just to be able to make cashier money. Embarrassing on VCU's part. I worked at a public university in CA that pays adjuncts 3x what VCU does and VCU has the larger endowment.

The one gender studies class I took for a single class session was like that. Prof's "service dog" went after my throat and she called me a slur.

I mean. That's still like $40k a year, likely without benefits. They'd be better off teaching public K12, which isn't known for being lucrative, but still. It at least has insurance, a pension, and summers off.

Correct-ish. Adjuncts could likely make more money doing just about any other career field if they were full time because adjuncting is not meant to be a full time job. At VCU it's far less than $40k a year because adjuncts are limited in the # of classes they can teach (because teaching more would require the university to pay things like health insurance, retirement, etc.) Nobody should be a "full time adjunct". Universities should do better by not relying on adjunct labor as much as they do, but at some point adjuncts need to drop out of the higher ed labor market if they can't get a full time job as a professor. Adjuncting should be for ABDs and grad students who are recently on the market, for professionals who teach very specific courses that focus more on specific professional skills than scholarship, or for retired faculty with PhDs. My previous reply was not meant to insinuate that $4.2k is a lot to be paid to teach a course; it's not and (in my opinion) students *should* be more upset at the # of courses they're taught by adjuncts (like the OP). But it's still quite a bit more than the $3k somebody cited, which should be pointed out.

Agreed on all that. Some (many?) universities have no problem giving adjuncts 3-4 classes a semester, plus summer. Varies by university and department, but I absolutely agree it's terrible. I've had one good adjunct. It was a technical course and he was from industry; very clearly he's made all the money he needed, but I appreciated his rigor and hands-on experience.

40k if you're teaching 10 classes a year, which basically no adjunct is/ can do even if they want to. And if you're a student in a class of an adjunct teaching 4 classes per semester, I'm sorry for you. But most adjuncts are probably teaching 2:2, as are the professors who are considered full time for that effort. So the adjuncts take home about 16k per year. Obviously they have other income, like teaching at a CC or freelance or waiting tables, etc. But saying adjuncts should drop out of the job if they can't get it full time job is pretty silly sounding to me. It would wreck VCU and would lead the lecturers away from the career they want and in some respect have, even if it's not very renumerative. It's like saying teachers should stop teaching at public school if they don't get paid more and go into education administration or another industry. Such a sad solution. The school can just alot more money to teachers. If they don't, they will go on strike eventually. And it will be very costly for everyone--students, adjuncts, and the school. And yeah, the school will probably "win" negotiations like they did last time, but they're shooting themselves in the foot, I think. The adjunct/grad student strikes are happening all over the country, school by school. VCU is just kicking the can down the road.

I'm going to assume the first half of your post is directed at somebody other than myself, since it just repeats what I said and I agree with your math. But I absolutely think that "career adjuncts" should not be a thing ... I consider those to be the adjuncts who consider the job as professor to be an important part of their identity because they have PhDs but were unable to land full time work, and so they rely on teaching multiple courses to help make ends meet instead of getting a regular full time job in a different industry. Fortunately, we don't generally have these types of adjuncts in CHS, but I understand they do exist in other units at VCU. Still, there is an over-reliance on adjuncts to teach courses that ideally would not be taught by adjuncts. You're right that this is because VCU views it as a more cost-effective way to staff their courses, but that really just makes adjuncts a fancy word for "scabs" in many cases (again, I think there *are* times when using adjuncts to staff a course are appropriate, but they are limited). (Also, I refuse to accept the narrative that fully staffing departments with highly qualified full-time faculty is what would "wreck" VCU and not some of the other decisions that are made by upper-level admins that prevent them from appropriately staffing their classes).

Yeah I was talking to the person above you for a bit there. And I feel like I agree with most of the things you're saying. I guess I'm just saying, adjuncts are not choosing to be "scabs," they're forced to be scabs. Plenty of the adjuncts are fully qualified to be full-time faculty, but VCU decides not to staff them accordingly because they can, because it's cheaper and they don't have to deal with tenure. There's intentional scarcity in the "professor" market to force folks to take adjunct spots in the hope that they accumulate enough experience to get the tenure slot some day. I realize that's not the case really with the "career adjuncts" but it's the case with many of us. Some people want to live in Richmond, and teaching is what they want to do, and there aren't many other alternatives. VCU is comfy with this set up. As for the decision that admins everywhere tend to make that I think is flawed, it is hiring more admin instead of more faculty. I also don't really know what I'm talking about here. Just venting as much as anything

Yeah, I appreciate all that. As you point out, it's definitely not the case that there's a scarcity of qualified PhDs to be hired into full time academic positions; it's completely manufactured by higher ed because they know they can. I suppose it's easy for me to say that they should stop teaching when the university will only hire them as an adjunct (if the university is trying to take advantage of them b/c of the manufactured scarcity), but I've been fortunate enough not to be in that position. Our unit is very fortunate to have some excellent adjuncts who can offer students some of the access to the "real world" that the academics on faculty cannot, and to have some excellent retired PhDs who just want to teach a course per semester to stay "in the game" a bit (not necessarily for the money). We've also made a number of questionable adjunct hires out of desperation over the years simply because we don't have enough full time faculty to staff them ourselves. That's a bummer for the students and waters down the value of higher ed in the eyes of the public. We have politicians who want to undermine and dismantle higher ed; it makes me mad that sometimes the threats are also coming from inside the house!

Happy first day of spring, Rams!

Those pear trees stink balls

I’m out Took my last exam today and can finally say I’m done. Wanted to say good luck to everyone and say if I can do it anyone can. Good luck rams!

i'm proud of you, UsedCondom6.

Aww, thank you, good luck with your future endeavors.

Good luck to you wherever you go. May your life find many good endeavors

Congratulations 🎉🎊 I hope your opportunities are endless!

Thank you ☺️ and good luck to you in your future endeavors !!!

Team, it's here.

Man I really dont want to die this young :( Edit: Okay fine, fuck all of you.

You won't die young, to covid-19 at least, like over 90% of the deaths are 70+ and that number is taken out of the already 2% fatality rate. As long as you don't have an auto immune disorder, you'll be fine, worst case you'll be out with a flu for a couple weeks. No worries everything will be closed during that time as well. Enjoy reading the news articles of the world pretending it's ending while out with the flu though.

I dont understand why you're being downvoted

Someone that is highly likely to be a healthy young adult is concerned about dying from a flu dubbed "boomer remover"

Anti-abortionists by the Compass I mean, this goes without saying but just avoid them. They’re just there for rage bait.

one time i was walking home from class and one of them stuck a mic in my face asking me what i thought about abortion, i just completely ignored them lol

I remember going by their tent once and seeing a dude dressed up as a trash can calling their views trash. What a great day that was lmao

A classmate was approached by one. Her response: "What makes you think you can talk to me?" Power move! I just gave a thumbs-up to the counterprotestors and moved on.

Kids these days with their “rage bait” What ever happened to the good old fashioned trolling of my Youth 😔

they suck so bad but they feed off attention, whether negative or positive. ignoring them is the best way to get under their skin

I wonder if they are actual vcu students or just come to our campus?

No fr and they’re set up at each corner to be as in the way as possible

Thought this said anti-arborists lol, “trees have feelings” etc

This is getting out of hand how many religious organizations I have to swim through to attend a state school. The separation of church and state is getting thinner and thinner.

I thought they were called pro life or is this different

My favorite response when they absolutely push to drag one out of me is "Man, I wish I was aborted so I wouldn't have to deal with your shit" which the couple of times I've had to use it stunned them enough for me to then walk away...

“Your mom should’ve had one”

Got stopped by one today. Vague answers don’t work on them unfortunately-

get with the times grandpa 😂

They’re not students. Just some group that goes out to college campuses to rile students up and then demonize them on social media. That’s literally it

It’s the same thing. If a person says they’re “pro-life” it usually means they’re against abortions

You can be pro-life and pro-choice at the same time. Many people are what they call “pro-life” not seeing abortion as an option for themselves, but believing people should have the right to choose.

...well damn, didn't expect this to get that much traction. Wish I could take credit for it but it was my buddy that taught me this one which so far has worked quite well for me. One of his other ones that I haven't used (yet) was to jump back a little with a shocked expression on his face and proclaim "Holy crap dude, you look like your mom had a failed abortion", if they kept pestering him then he'd whip out the abortion/dead baby jokes, which I really can't share here. Mark, I miss you buddy, may you rest in piece like all of those aborted fetuses that preceded you...

I always wonder if they think they change minds by doing that. Surely they know it just pisses people off?

Sweet ty I am pro life

Like I said, it’s likely done to bait a reaction from us and then demonize college students (and the left by extension)

Like OP said, they're using it to make propaganda. The VCU students aren't the ones they're harassing are the ones they're trying to reach

nice moment told someone i’m a 1st yr grad student and they unironically said “welcome to the ramily”! ngl made my day!!

An uncommon response!

I never had anyone say that to me. Lol

Why are we letting Youngkin to speak for us when he vetoed minimum wage increases? Does anyone have have an opinion on letting Youngkin speak when his controversial politics is the giant elephant in the room? I did not find paying for college easy as both of my parents make minimum wage so his decision actually impacted my family's lives. They work in the food industry and my dad is a waiter and mom is a sandwich maker. I really cannot celebrate my own graduation knowing the kind of suffering that my parents have to go through in helping me pay for college, how hard they saved up so that I could have the opportunity to graduate from this school.

"We" don't get to decide. Our shitty admin makes that decision for us.

In [this thread from a few days ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/vcu/comments/1bnfta1/va_gov_glenn_youngkin_to_be_2024_university_wide/), as well as [this one from the RVA subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/rva/comments/1bnhrtj/gov_youngkin_named_vcus_2024_commencement_speaker/), you'll find a better option than going to the university-wide ceremony where he will be speaking (hint: it's your departmental graduation), and a good discussion on the topic (and it's not going in Youngkin's favor)...

No no no let him come it’ll be funny

A couple weeks ago, Youngkin demanded to see the syllabi of classes taught at VCU (I'm not sure if it's specific classes or all classes). I suspect that he intends to try to push for regulations regarding what is taught in universities if he doesn't like what he sees. I think him being invited to speak at commencement is a way of appeasing him to try to prevent him cracking down on public universities, but that's just my opinion.

Because he appoints the board of visitors… and he will be setting the budget and vcu needs $ after their recent development fiasco. I was on the fence about attending the university wide commencement, but the decision to have him speak made my decision to not attend easy. Just go to your department’s commencement, that’s the one where you actually walk anyways.

I hope only 10 people show up

Youngkin needs to take a hike with his whole shakedown schtick.

Governor Robert F McDonnell - who I did not vote for or support - spoke at my graduation in 2012. I simply didn’t attend. The Business School ceremony, which I did attend, was far more intimate, and had an uncontroversial business leader (from a bank?) as the keynote speaker. Make an adult decision for yourself; he’s not going to be disinvited no matter how “upset” his policies makes you feel. He is, after all, a duly elected (lame duck) Governor, and you attend one of the largest Public Universities in the Commonwealth. Enjoy this moment; don’t let the Governor take your joy over his (unpopular) stance on minimum wage of all things.

People graduating college shouldn't be earning minimum wage >both of my parents make minimum wage So you should have gotten plenty of aid >I did not find paying for college easy And yet, you are considering $90k/year out of state most expensive school instead of VCU that you apparently don't go to. How do you do, fellow students? https://old.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1c87oqb/is_usc_considered_as_prestigious_as_uc_berkeley/l0d0cg2/

Boo that man

And cannabis rec market

The school/admin doesn’t really have a choice and basically has to invite him to speak since as a public university he’s ultimately the one that signs their checks. Whether or not there’s pushback after the fact is a different story

It wasn’t admin who make this decision. VCU is a state institution under the Governor. President Rao reports to the BOV which reports to Youngkin. He basically appointed himself and unless there is an enormous petition by the public that influences him to give up his commencement speech, VCU really has no choice but to just go along with it.

FINALLY, they add symptomatic testing numbers to the Dashboard. And they don’t look good.

538 Negative test don’t look good out of the 789? I’m not tryna be rude or anything but could someone explain why this is big boy bad?

I’m confused, what’s is the difference between this and “Active Cases”

Waiting for /u/FishFingerLover to explain this shit to me lol

If you're getting a positive test rate over 30%, you aren't testing enough people, the virus is spreading out control, or some combination of both. Covid-19 has a number of symptoms that overlap with other illnesses, especially when the bounds are extended to mild versions of different symptoms. So, the overwhelming majority of symptomatic people who get tested for it *should* receive a negative result, indicating that their symptoms are likely due to something else. A positive test rate of 5% is often used as a threshold that we want to stay below, though even that is a little lenient. A positive tests rate of 31.8% is leaps and bounds beyond that somewhat lax threshold, so they are limiting who they are testing or a crazy number of people have it. Either way, not great. Note that for symptomatic people, we use 5% as a somewhat arbitrary threshold. If we are talking prevalence testing (where the testing is on a random sample of people, independent of any symptoms), the percentage should be much lower than that.

My guess is that 789 is not really a sizable percentage of the total students on campus

VCU has been bragging about their low positivity rate, but they were only reporting numbers for the prevalence tests (the asymptomatic tests). VDH (Virginia Department of Health) positivity rates combine asymptomatic and diagnostic tests. Doing so with VCU now gives a positivity rate of about 14.5%. Of course, we need to remember that a) this doesn’t include numbers from students testing off-campus who choose not to report results, and b) these are semester-long numbers, while VDH usually reports averages of the past seven days.

I’m guessing that this just tests if you have symptoms while active cases would be people confirmed to actually have coronavirus.

^^^^ same hahaha

Honestly, I've needed a break from the internet for a while. Y'all seem to have a good grasp of it, so I don't really see much worth explaining.

These numbers should be in line with the state average and they’re not which is very worrying. There needs to be much larger contact tracing going on at the university.

Athletic Department and COVID - Okay, maybe it's just me, but VCU admitted to a 44-person cluster in the Athletic Department. They continue to send us emails about not gathering in groups of more than 10, we are required to wear masks.... CAN SOMEONE PLEASE EXPLAIN WHY THIS DOES NOT APPLY TO THE STUDENTS PRACTICING SPORTS???!?!?!? saw 30+ kids on the athletic fields today playing lacrosse/hockey. NOT A SINGLE GIRL was wearing a mask and obviously they are all not social distancing. I'm failing to understand how this is fair???? They all get Covid from each other, and bring it on to campus and then we all get it??? This is ridiculous in my opinion, and I wanted to find out what others think. I really want to send an email to VCU expressing my concerns?

Why are masks not mandatory

Men’s baseball literally had a “Covid Party” where people shared cups, but the university only wants to focus on Greek Life bc it fits the narrative lol

Take a pic and send to the news reporter who posted on reddit last week, jk. But no excuses doesn't matter if they represent VCU,they have to follow just like everyone else. Maybe if its hard to wear a mask while doing sports, than at least wear a face shield/stay apart when possible. If they go down then we all go down -- no favoritism, follow the rules.

I don’t get how they allowed fall sports to continue, many schools canceled theirs. People on sports teams are in high contact to begin with, what’s the reason to continue to allow it now? Is anyone even going to the games? a whole mess...

There must be some way we can petition???

this is extremely fucked up

If you send them an email, you’ll get a generic bs thing saying “we take your comments seriously bla bla bla”. I’ve tried. But worth a shot.

As someone on an athletic team, we are required to wear masks in closed spaces, not allowed to hang out with other teams/people, cannot eat in restaurants, have to wear masks when in huddles, warming up, after practice, in cars, and whenever we congregate around a space, we all have individual water bottles, equipment, and other necessary things that used to be communal. Have daily checks and frequent covid tests. We have a bunch of rules you dont see or dont know. You are at a higher risk of expulsion and have a ton of guidelines. We probably are collectively more safe than going to walmart. Masks are mandatory except when physically active outside on a field/when directly preforming strenuous activity. We wear them when working out indoors. So youre wrong and just keep it to yourself next time. If youre concerned about getting covid then stay inside :)

Exactly my point. They are but the sports kids aren't wearing them to practice.

Do you have proof or article or something?

in a team meeting very early in the semester it was made very clear by the coaching staff that any thing like a party would result in "expulsion" from school. you sure you don't mean the track team?

If they were wearing face shields I definitely wouldn't have written this post! That's such a good option.

The A10 cancelled all fall sports so not really sure why the athletic teams are practicing tbh

U just admitted yall don't wear masks outside

I mean obvi "nerdee" needs to pay more attention in classes than to their sport. 1) others covered the testing part. 2) Walmart requires mask so no way in hell yall are safer than them. 3) doesn't concern me??? I actually am part of the 17% that went back to school. I am on campus three days a week because I'm in a field where its needs to be taught practically. You know.... a field that will actually give me a job. Also didn't realize you literally came back to RVa to live in a bubble. FYI GUYS: COVID only spreads in restaurants and people from sports teams, not going to the same grocery store or pharmacy or any other place in the city Finally. You obviously are exactly like anyone else attending a covid party. DUMB AS BRICKS. Clearly you more than any of us NEEDS to be in school.. regularly. Get educated about the facts of covid and how it spreads and I hope you never reproduce. Stay safe everyone. Except this person. Who thinks they are immune to the pandemic.

We’re also all negative.... how can it spread if you dont have it? Also it literally doesnt concern you. Us being allowed to practice isnt affecting the entirety of the university?

Are you being tested everyday?

right? unless you are tested every day & get the results that day, you don't know. that is what the pro teams are doing. & even then they are having problems. this is bizarre and frightening. unless you are being tested every day? and if so, where are those results being reported? they don't seem to be on the dashboard

Moonflower PSA Since the Moonflower Tent is back today, I wanted to make a post to let everyone know this is a reselling group. Moonflower claims all their jewelry is homemade, but many of their products are from AliExpress/Wish/etc and are being resold for wayyy more money than you can buy them online. I can't promise this is true for all of their products, but since I've found many of them to be able to be purchased for under 10$ each on wholesale sites, it is probably true that most, if not all, are not homemade. If that isn't a problem for you, of course feel free to buy from them! I just felt scammed when I spent money on rings from them when I was a freshman, only later to find the same rings for so cheap, so I thought I'd spread the word!

One time I got a ring of theirs stuck on my finger and they ran out of lotion so I ended up just buying it 😭

Alternatives in Carytown sells similar products and \*actually\* give back to indigenous communities that help make their products. 10/10 recommend going to them instead. Sometimes they have a booth on the corner of Brandt/Rhoads and Monroe Park. edit: they also have a booth out this week by the compass

Wait, people are reselling Wish items? 💀

damn their instagram feels so fake now, knowing this😂😭 I bought a ring for me and one for my partner

Welcome to late stage capitalism

Damn that fucking sucks, i once bought a pair of earrings there for my mom. Shit like this sucks and is so disingenuous.

Wooks gonna wook. Don't buy shit from hippies, especially ones that post up on college campuses with business names like "Moonflower". Come on y'all.

You can literally Google image search every single thing on their Instagram and find it immediately

this is sooo funny😂😭

I was with the director/owner of Alternatives. She runs a ecological/medical mission trip to Guatemala. I bought some hand woven pillow covers from the indigenous women. 10/10 recommend

“Always has been” * space man shooting meme format *

this is a good lesson for me lmao

Please actually be *quiet* on the quiet/silent floors of Cabell Library. Guys I’m literally begging you to be quiet in the library on the quiet and silent floors. Please utilize the collaborative floors + the basement for group work. It’s extremely frustrating for a lot of students who purposefully go to these floors for quiet study. Thank you! Edit: I know Cabell can get full sometimes. You can also do collaborative work in the commons basement + first/second floor, MCALC in empty classrooms (or common areas), outside, and the new engineering building just to name a few. :))

You can chat with library staff on the website, instant-message style I think, might be a decent way to snitch quick without having to go downstairs. Never never never feel bad about telling security, the quiet floors are there for a reason!

never thought id say it but rat them out lmao

i recommend just reporting loud groups of people to security

every time i go up to the 4th floor theres always someone talking loud as hell like are you new here??

Sad that you gotta say this

What is MCALC?

People should definitely shut up on these floors, but if it bothers you to that extent there's the option of going all the way up to the fourth floor where there is a dead silent room where you could literally hear a pin drop. It's silent to the point it's almost unnerving, I recommend it.

Lmao...this was a problem 12 years ago when I was there. It's never gonna stop cuz ppl are dumb. My advice...ear buds.

I didn’t know you could do that, tbh. Thank you!

They likely are new here, lol. Or they can’t read signage.

Monroe Park Campus Academic Learning Commons! It’s on Floyd Avenue, right next to Cabell Library. There are classrooms/lecture halls, common areas, and a few rooms you can reserve for studying. The Writing Center is also in this building on the fourth floor!

Say hello to security 💅

When I was in that situation I’d just text a number and they’d send someone to do the shushing. Can confirm it was very satisfying.

I've had to do this before. You can chat with the front desk on the library's website, they'll send a security guard up to tell whoever it is to shut up.

i mean you’d have to be blind illiterate and stupid to miss the signs. also they never shut up ab the library floor system on tours and at orientation so you’d think they’d remember. or they’d figure it out from ppl being SILENT

Lmao 22 downvotes. Was just joking

Who else has burnout? I do not feel the energy to do anything academic anymore. And it sucks because I really need a strong gpa for graduate school in my desired health profession. Canceling spring break was so dumb. I know they did it bc of covid reasonings but it ended up being unnecessary. And in the email about reopening in person classes because virtually learning impacts our mental health and learning success, it only benefits a small proportion of students. If they cared about our mental health they would’ve gave us a virtual break and kept classes online. And when we relay this issue to professors and ask for some leniency on assignments, they dont care and continue to pile stuff on us with full expectations like multiple students havent told them that we’re suffering. Sorry this post is long and all over the place, my brain is fried and i’m not coherent TL;DR: students are suffering from burnout but vcu/vcu professors dgaf

I'm sorry you're having a hard time :( I used to suffer major burnout but at this point I've figured out what works for me... if you haven't already, I really suggest making a routine and sticking with it and check out Bullet Journaling for day-to-day tasks. Also, even if you have a lot of work, make sure to do things for yourself <3 It can be as simple as taking the time to make your favorite meal or setting aside 30 minutes to watch a YouTube video you've been meaning to watch. Keep your head up <3 We're just over halfway through this semester and you've survived it so far. You're stronger than you think!

I graduated recently, but as an adult, I'm still burnt out. Focusing on work, studying for career development, and even just keeping up with personal goals involving things like fitness and hobbies is becoming difficult. Turns out being mostly isolated for over a year will wreck your motivation.

I've got burnout paradise, does that count?

I feel you. I am burnt out as well. I am putting grad school on hold for a while and will most likely take a gap year or two when I graduate in August. I amprobably going to work in a national park and spend some time in nature before returning to the academic world. Hang in their friend, the home stretch for this semester is in sight. If you get a chance once the semester is over, make sure to care for your mental health and give yourself a break.

Literally was thinking about this just this morning. I didn’t realize how necessary spring break would really be for me :/

What are your zoom stories this year? I was in a zoom class today and had my first "holy shit" experience. The class had just been started, and no one was speaking really. All of us students are still being let in through the waiting room when someone does start talking. "I fucking hate this class. This professor is horrible. This is such a fucking bullshit class." The best part is we had a guest speaker who chimes in "We can hear you." No reaction from the teacher, or guest speaker other than that. The student then promptly exits the meeting. That is my mildly exciting zoom experience for the year. Any more you all want to share? Edit: a word

One of my zoom lectures got somehow got “hacked” by a troll last week. For context, this class is a hybrid course that meets two days a week where half the class comes in person one day and attends lecture on Zoom the other day. Our class is wired with speakers and microphones in the ceiling so anyone that talks on zoom can be heard clearly by the entire class. Anyway, I was there in person that day and everything seemed normal at first. However, a couple minutes into class, “WHAT’S UP, UGLIES?” blared out from some girl over the speakers and we all burst out laughing. I don’t remember exactly what she did, but she continued to interrupt several more times over the course of the lecture and it quickly became annoying. She even started blasting WAP over the speakers at one point. My professor, to his credit, stayed pretty calm and kept either muting her or kicking her out (not sure which since I wasn’t in the Zoom meeting), but she kept coming back under different names. Apparently, my classmates on Zoom were even arguing with her and asking her to leave in the Zoom chat. Eventually, during a lull near the end of the lecture, one of my classmates on Zoom decided to call her out over the actual Zoom meeting and told our professor what name she was using. She basically admitted it and then proceeded to try and accuse one of our classmates, who we knew was actually in the course, of being a hacker/troll as well. I don’t know if she decided to leave on her own after that or my professor found a way to permanently kick her out, but that exchange was the last we heard of her. When it was clear she was gone, my professor just remarked, “too bad she doesn’t actually want to learn about spectrophotometry” and then proceeded to finish the lecture. After class, he emailed out new, password-protected Zoom links for the next lecture.

Someone got into one of my zoom classes and set their name as someone else’s and they yelled “shut the hell up!” and kept breathing really heavily into the mic. Also heard someone take a phone call while unmuted where the n word was used and the professor called them out.

i was at an SI session for class, and only our SI leader had his camera on. without realizing her mic was unmuted, a girl said pretty loudly "DAMNN HES KINDA CUTE THOOO" and im guessing her friend beside her irl said "girl... ur mics not muted" and she gasped SO loud.. and our SI leader was laughing but didnt say anything about it

Left my mic on while taking a test, didn’t realize my roommate was watching King of The Hill, the teacher asked “Why is Bobby Hill in my classroom?”

Right before class started, while the professor was giving everyone a couple minutes to log on, one of the student video feeds came up with their webcam off, but their sound on. I could hear popping and crackling noises, then the sound of coughing, multiple times... So yeah, they were 100% taking bong rips on mic. I'm pretty sure the professor knew what was going on, but he just waited for them to finish before starting class like nothing happened. PSA to everyone using Zoom: always make sure you're muted as soon as you enter the room.

This girl joined the Zoom session talking about a pimple, saying, "puss and shit was coming out" then muted herself. My teacher started laughing and asked to please mute yourself when talking about stuff like that.

😂 oh my gosh that's horrible..

Nothing crazy has happened to me yet. I did get to see my art professors partners dog tho :)

I think one of the best zoom experiences I've had isn't even when I had a meeting. It was when someone described their zoom story, and spelled "hear" as "here". Educational quality has really decreased since the zombie virus.

>somehow got hacked by a troll last week >password-protected zoom links You know why this isn’t gonna do anything and how a troll “hacked” into your class? It’s somebody that’s *already in* your class that gives out the code to other people. That girl or another troll is gonna keep infiltrating your class as long as one of your classmates keep sending her the link and password. If you’ve ever seen those “crashing online zoom classes” videos on YouTube, it’s the same story. Youtubers tell their fans to send them links to their upcoming class and tell them about the class so they’ll be able to get in, troll, and recall certain basic info like “this is history 101 with Mrs. X, right?”

I was just about to share that story 😂

God I wish that were me

My bad. Thanks for the lesson. I will work on my comprehensn.

Oof imagine typing this out and then still posting it

gone are the days of Chase McDude https://youtu.be/xuOnJAtCsVc

>Chill out I wasn’t arguing with you, I was just letting you know what’s up.

if this post doesn’t scream UVA then idk what does

From Charlottesville. Can confirm, that is an issue a UVa student would have.

dont the cars/app on your phone literally tell you where the stations are??? why are they asking a whole subreddit

Wasn't it just like three years ago that some sheik's kid had a gold-plated car at VCU? Glass dorms amigos.

Also from Charlottesville, disappointed but not surprised

I thought the comments would be clowning them for both owning a Tesla. I was wrong.

Same, UVA students IK are going on a very lavish Europe trip this summer for about a month and a half. They literally did not understand that I couldn't join them because I have a full time job and they were trying to get me to spend like 1k every 2 days.

To the girl I saw in Coliseum Lofts today while touring Heyy! So my friend and I were touring Coliseum Lofts today around an hour back and the apartments and prices seemed suspiciously good. The leasing office had some decent units ready, then I saw you on the third floor walking by mouthing ‘Don’t live here Don’t live here’. I wanted to ask you what are all the issues you found living here :(( To anyone reading this post, where all are good 2b2b units available that are decent around a price range of $1400-$1700 for the full place?

Sister lived there. Bugs. So many bugs they dont care about. Her and her roomies were SO clean but the roaches still came for them. Neighbors were annoying. Rent was way more than the place was worth.

me and a friend toured the lofts back in july and the same thing happened to us but a girl showed us her phone when the tour guide had her back to us. the phone read “there’s roaches” and then literally 5 minutes after a roach ran by our feet in the hallway while walking to another unit. it was in fact too good to be true.

I have never lived there myself, but I had a friend who basically moved in with me to avoid their apartment at Coliseum lofts. I can't speak on them myself as my friend said his apartment was so cold, dark, and dingy he didn't let me visit. According to him, it always smelled bad and rain/snow would get into the apartment.

It's been a decade but my friends had an apartment there for 2 years. The halls smell like old bongwater and there are a ton of bugs. The only upside is price and proximity to campus.

Missed connectionnnnnnnnn

I lived there for two years in a 2bd/2bth. Honestly, there were bugs but I honestly feel like you’re gonna get them in any older Richmond building. For the price and having all utilities included as well as location, I think it’s worth it, but it’s up to you on whether or not you’re willing to go for it. My units were both quite spacious/had great windows too but there were def issues at points

My friend lived there for a year the big complaints were some roaches and wood lice. Their unit also didn’t have any windows only a couple of skylights and I’ve heard from others who rented there that the leasing office doesn’t always tell you which kind of unit you’ll get (windows or skylights) until after you sign

Lived at Coliseum Lofts for two years when I transferred to VCU (2019 - 2021). We had one of the 2bed 2bath loft units directly in the front of the building (it was actually the top unit right above broadway wireless). While we didn’t really have issues with our specific unit, there were quite a few issues with the building itself. First, management team in the leasing office changed about 4 times while we lived there which made things difficult. My BIGGEST issue were the laundry facilities. There’s 8 washers and 8 dryers and at least half, if not more, were consistently broken or gross (mainly from misuse by residents). Not only were they pretty expensive but the payment process was very inconvenient. They were supposed to accept debit/credit card but that hardly ever worked so you had to purchase the laundry card and the machine did not take coins for loading the card but the prices were like $1.29. We never had an issue with roaches in our unit but we did have a lot of house centipedes (evidence of roaches elsewhere). I did see waterbugs (still technically roaches) in the hallways and elevator from time to time. Building security was a joke half the time due to broken FOB scanners and I went to do laundry one day only to find a homeless man sleeping in there. Friends also had to deal with another homeless man sleeping in the stairwell to the parking garage. Said friends lived in one of the back units facing the alley and they had quite a few issues with rain water leaking in from the roof. The parking garage is also a NIGHTMARE as there are support beams everywhere and tandem parking spots. Every single one of us managed to scrape our cars on a pole at some point. All this being said, you get what you pay for and you certainly won’t find any better for the same price. Unfortunately, all of the apartment buildings in this city at that price range are going to have the same issues. For instance, the iron house apartments next to coliseum are even worse from what I’ve heard and don’t have parking.

I just want to say, that's a girl's girl.

i almost rented there bc there was a really nice unit being rented by a private owner, but the reviews for the building as a whole were so terrible we had to stay away.

I have not lived there but I almost did about 2 years ago and the reason I backed out was because they did the random roommate draw and I was in the units basically set up like a dorm so you are like a couple feet from your roommate ( I was very desperate) and I don’t recall there ever being a gender selection and they put me in a room with a guy who was way older than me and when I brought this to the leasing office attention they just told me that there is nothing they can do and I was lucky and was able to sublease it and it worked out but that alone put a very bad taste in my mouth also the reviews were horrendous

DONT LIVE THERE management is horrid and switched like 3 times in the one year we were stuck there. they lied about the place we were getting, and put us in a unit with a support beam in the middle of the bedroom and the only 2 windows were right in front of a wall. view was legit a wall. no sunlight. horrible. elevator was always broken. also the key fobs and doors barely work anyone can get in. we came in to a homeless man in front of our unit on the third floor. homeless people stayed in the stairways, we saw mattresses and garbage, and there was piss on the stairways every week. never got cleaned, also found a rat in the washer. parking garage was even worse. pls dont 🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻

I lived there in 2018-2019 and rented a 2B/2bath and it was fine and had no issues. Then rented a studio and my unit smelled so strongly of cigarettes but other than that no issues. Laundry was annoying because people would leave their stuff in for hours and then would get pissed if you moved it. I was once working out in the gym and thought a guy was just resting when I realized he was homeless and was sparking up a full blunt. The management team when I was there was good but I’m almost positive they’re gone now. Every apartment has something. I live in one of the “luxury” apartments in Scott’s Addition and maintenance did drywall work in my apartment without putting down any sort of covering so everything got covered, missed several spots of work, the elevator is constantly out (typical for rva) and management has been horrible about responding to my emails.

i lived there for a year around 2021-2022, DO NOT MOVE THERE, my room had the windows literally boarded up and that accompanied by lack of skylight or overhead lights alone should steer you away. the staff was absolutely useless, the amenities such as laundry were always filthy, and there was somehow construction noises 24/7.

I lived here for a year. The best part was this woman named CJ who was my landlord but she got fired. There’s cockroaches and it smells pretty bad but it’s livable. I had no windows like many others have mentioned, but I didn’t really mind. I kinda liked it for sleeping in. Some other apartments are super loud sometimes though, mainly on weekends. It’s good if you really can’t afford better, but there’s definitely better if you can afford better. You get what you pay for

The roaches can get ridiculous even if your apartment is clean or empty, and the hallways frequently smell of pet waste. The elevator breaks every few weeks, and the parking garage is very tight, especially when the trash piles up from one wall almost to the other. The washing machines are filthy due to the amount of pet hair and mold, and trust me, I’ve asked for them to be cleaned. Overall, it’s a place to live. From what I heard, you get roaches anywhere you go in Richmond, and living on Broad is an amazing experience for both the campus and easy access to nightlife and great food. Neighbors can be very nice and utilities are included, in the end I couldn’t find much better for the price but let’s hope that changes when the lease is up.

don’t do it.. my friend lived there last year and it was a complete shit show. I’m not even kidding. Her apartment was literally in the parking garage….. on top of all of that her bathroom ceiling caved in due to a leak and management refused to fix it and let her use a completely different apartment bathroom instead of fixing it for three months…. she literally had to go from the first floor all the way to the third floor just to shower….

I lived there up until a couple months ago, it’s horribly dark and dingy, and the roaches are everywhere. You can find a much better place for the same cost

lived there. people would park in our spot after hours and we had no way of getting them to move. power would go out when we were out and therefore garage door wouldn’t open. neighbors would either be fucking or arguing constantly which meant we always heard it because the walls are paper thin.

my friend got vitamin D deficiency living in coliseum lofts because her window was so tiny and was basically up against another building lol

There’s only a few of them, but the Jackson Street Lofts are pretty great for $1600. Everything is included except for electric.

That's too much for that slum lord dorm.

So many roaches

Check out the Biggs building just across broad. I lived there for my sophomore and junior years and had a great experience. Rent was reasonable, I think I paid around 600 for my half. It’s probably a little more now but still. I was not spectacularly clean, but I never saw a single bug or rodent. There a live in maintenance men who do fast repairs. Leasing office is in building so you can get in touch quickly to get issues resolved. Floor to ceiling windows and beautiful wooden floors in most first level units

The current in Manchester has been great

Also, living directly on Broad Street was NOT fun for them

Ahh! That was me! I try my best to warn everyone I see touring because we were lied to about the roach issue…and after talking to my neighbor about it, the leasing office always acts surprised when a tenant raises the concern. Coliseum Lofts suck 0/10 and I can’t wait until our lease is up!

I’m happy you heeded her warning 😂 she told me she wished someone would have done the same for us.

Bugs are an urban hazard, but my kid hasn’t seen any at Pine Court in the past year.

agree it’s def luck of the draw w the units

just make sure yall stay away from textile and miller lofts as someone who used to work there 😭😭

why is that?

hahaha thank you!! you’re saving lives!!

Yeah it’s super loud and if you have a car and don’t have a parking spot in the garage, parking is absolutely horrible outside

The bike and quad riders racing down broad every night for one.

Where on or near campus has these I just need some of this in my life rn and I’m not tryna spend an hour round trip to go to target. Is there anything walking distance from Monroe to get these. Thanks

maybe you are nearby a bus stop that can get you to kroger? i’m sure they have these in their bakery area

Lombardy Kroger should have them. Probably Halloween themed right now, but same diff

Kroger most definitely has them

lombardy kroger, it’s like 10/15 minute walk from monroe depending on how fast you walk. i was just there a few days ago and they were stocked up on these

Kroger ones hit different istg

Kroger always does in the baked goods section by the seafood

Food lion does them!

Just an FYI they are just frozen sugar cookies, that are thawed out in the container they come in. But they are tasty. As everyone has said Food Lion and Kroger Both carry them.

Whole Foods also has them

Take the pulse down to shockoe bottom and it will drop you off right in front of farm fresh

Carytown and Lombardy Kroger! If you have a kitchen, I have the recipe for these as well!!

Kroger ones are shit. Walmarts are pretty far but the ones they have are a lot better

This post is so real

Maybe the ram city market; it is next to panda

Shindigz may not have these exactly however they have lots of stuff!

I've never understood the appeal of these cookies

Dawg… every kroger

Thank yall for the Kroger and food lion rec, just wanted somewhere even closer bc im crippled rn like a smaller grocer or corner store but THANKS EITHER WAY!

Got some at publix

Aldis and lidl, both can be reached by the bus on broad st

Never been a fan of these. Then you got people like my buddy who ate one off of parking lot pavement that had been out there more than a day

Holy shit you kids are useless.

For sure Walmart.

Walmart delivery, they have them.

Walmart has these

I forgot, Target has these too!

Bus to target

Walmart has them all year long

Just get some insomnia cookies and get it over with ;D

Went to Kroger yesterday and didn’t see any but maybe next time LMAO they should have fall themed

The carytown one you could take bus 5 (cary/main/whitcomb) going westbound

They’re so good they’re nasty

You don’t like dry, dusty cookies topped with the best frosting that saves the day? Man.

It tastes like preservatives and the downfall of mankind, but damn does the body crave these cookies

Oh hell naw bru what ..

I have gone to Kroger and bought these from them, they do have them

They definitely have these all year round

I got some of these from Kroger yesterday.

I've just verbally been told it's a nostalgia thing. Eating these cookies reminds one of a 4 yr old birthday party. I understand that.

Apres les, le deluge

No lie. Saw it on the ground one day, next day he says he found and ate a cookie on the walk out to practice. It had rained overnight 😂

Yea honestly I didn’t look too hard but thank u mwa

If they’re not out in the bakery, just ask a worker if there’s any in stock. I used to work a Kroger Bakery and we always had a ton of extra stuff in the back and the freezer. Horrible company to work for, but as long as you ask nicely and respectfully, shouldn’t be an issue

Ofc, np at all!! If you can’t find it at lombardy Kroger, I’d check ramcity market(low chance, but on campus), or willow lawn Kroger💪🏽

Kroger, Wal-mart, and Target are the three best chances. Target is probably the easiest besides Kroger to get to without a car from campus

Triples in GRC I’m in GRC over the summer and figured someone might benefit from seeing the converted lounges as the triples they’re being used as. I wouldn’t freak out. Living with 2 other people in one room sucks but this is probably enough space for 3 people if you pack light. You could probably rearrange it to make the space feel bigger as well. You’ll get a closet with 2 doors (one having a bulletin board) and 2 drawers, a desk with 1 hollow cabinet space (?) and a lockable drawer, a 3 drawer dresser, and a bed.

the doors are glass?? jfc dude vcu needs to stop accepting so many people this is ridiculous

Actually, I would freak out- and I did when I moved my little brother into those exact rooms. AND his was a QUAD…..I can’t believe how much we paid and how much of a luxury we thought it would be. Cheap, liars. As per usual, fuck u vcu!!

This looks like one of the study lounges they converted to a dorm room. Sigh. Here we go again with converted spaces and forced triples and forced quads. 😡 Wondering if they are going to house freshman in the hotel again.

Off campus is cheaper too. Why live on campus?

This is crazy bro

This looks more like a hallway than a dedicated room. Wtf? Also are you trying to make this sound better than it actually is? That's some mad cope and I know they are still charging people like crazy for these spaces. Screw that and you too

# Triples makes it safe. Triples is best.

WHATT THEY DID THIS??

I swear to god this would be solved if VCU would just invest in making a new dorm instead of 5000 new stem buildings

You think this is bad? I lived in this exact same room set up in GRC but it was a Quad room 🥲🥲🥲🥲

oh my god the glass door is insane. how is that legal?? such a privacy violation. surely there are blinds?

I was a freshman in 2020, are these the movie theaters rooms converted?? I can barely tell what this was

Hey! I am renting out this property that has the option to be fully furnished. It is 3 bed, 1.5 bath and is a 10 minute walk from campus. Here is the zillow link [https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/1020-Kinney-St-Richmond-VA-23220/12527296\_zpid/](https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/1020-Kinney-St-Richmond-VA-23220/12527296_zpid/)

That is foul 😰

Oh my this is horrible they need to stop accepting so many students. I’m a senior now and currently still on the waitlist for housing.

why does anyone go to this school anymore lol they’re just gonna keep doing it more and more

Wtf. This is awful. Thank you for sharing to warn incoming freshman. Remember- you do not HAVE to live on campus if you don’t want to live like this. There are other options !

Lmaooo bro it used to be four class of 27’ never saw the lounges ever

I may be wrong but I don’t think this is gonna be a rooms. I feel like they are just storing stuff in there

I saw on the website they’re still accepting undergraduate applications for Fall 2025. Why are they taking so many students that they can’t house?

yeah, i know the lounges were used as room in the 23-24 year and there were curtains over the windows and doors. they got removed presumably because of the cum stains on the couches. so at the very least there will be curtains on the door ?

And no blinds on windows. What were they thinking? Maybe they haven't finished the reno?

exactly what it is, they where lounges for students on every floor now they’re all dorms. without proper ac btw….

I was in Johnson Hall when it closed down in 2021 (I got a converted study room in GRC) Are they still putting freshmen up in hotels?? Jfc VCU needs to get it together there’s already an overcrowding issue in some majors, can’t believe they are doing this AGAIN

It’s a requirement Freshman year. The housing issue in downtown Richmond is insane, so if every freshman VCU accepted tried finding a place off campus, every single crevice and alleyway would be taken. A ridiculous percentage is expected to drop out before Sophomore year though, which is why it’s manageable Edit: I guess it’s not a requirement anymore

I was in a Rhoads quad, I feel your pain

My son was in one of the quad rooms, it was rough. He had to use a chair to get into bed because they were pushed up right against the wall and wardrobes. Between that and the non-stop fire alarms, we got him moved. I hope the alarms have calmed down, he'd head to an exam with like 3 hours sleep. Hang in there, Rams.

There aren’t any blinds. During the 23-24 school year when the lounges got turned into quads I think they cardboarded and duck taped the glass doors

In fall 2020 they actually had the lounges closed off due to covid and you couldn’t use most of the amenities in GRC

It’s definitely going to be a room. They had these spaces utilized as forced quads in previous years when they accepted more first year students than housing spaces.

im an incoming freshmen for fall 2025. this sorta looks like my apartment ...

They're greedy and are horrible at managing money, so they accept everyone so they can get more money to spend on building useless stuff

I don’t believe they are using the Jefferson hotel this year (or any hotel) but it is interesting as they STILL have students on the waitlist for on campus housing as of this week. I haven’t heard of nor seen any notifications confirming hotel usage for this school year.

Living on campus isn’t required for freshman/first year students

It is not a requirement

Wasn't aware they made Freshman mandatory. I thought it was optional/guaranteed then but not mandatory. Sounds like everyone should just get some credits at community college to come in as a sophomore at least. Still it's dumb I agree.

meant dorm\*

Hope not! Also, The study rooms are only good for like 2 people max. I can’t imagine having a 3rd roommate stuck in that room.

ICYMI, the 220 workers who clean public spaces at VCU will have their hourly pay increase to $16.30 from $12, a HUGE win for their first union contract!

I mean I’m glad they got a raise but in this economy you need at least $20 an hour to survive in any capacity

Then get an education or learn a trade that allows you to earn that . Dont always expect to be handed something

As a milk drinker… post the link

this has the same energy as that lettuce eating club where they have a yearly competition to see who can eat a head of lettuce the fastest or something

You got a problem with Vitamin D, fam? You got a problem with me.

I think one should have to complete a gallon-challenge for admission to such an illustrious group.

Frats 🤢 Alliance of Milk Drinkers 🥵

Yummmm, I do love drinking milf.

oh my i am 100% joining this club

Isn’t this a Skyrim meme? Although, it’s meant in an negative connotation…welp, good for them. Guess we will be seeing milk drinking competitions in Monroe Park this semester.

sorry my dad never really returned with milk so i now have problems w milk drinkers 😔😔

plastic glitter blowing all over the compass. i know everyone wants a special graduation photo but at least clean up your trash afterwards like a decent person.

Gross and that stuff will end up in the James.

agreed. it's been going on for weeks now, if you want to have that sort of thing just use paper streamers or even seaweed glitter..

There’s something about the type of person who uses glitter that I immediately distrust.

This is all over the place, it makes me so angry. If you insist on using the plastic or foil glitter/confetti/streamers maybe do it indoors so you can sweep it up? Or like another person said, use something biodegradable. I just can't fathom the carelessness for the environment.

Had the misfortune of walking through a shower of that shit yesterday.

Be my guest

Seaweed glitter is a thing? Sounds delicious

hope you stretched well before jumping all the way to that conclusion

definitely isnt, but it definitely is biodegradable unlike regular glitter!

I bet everyone that downvoted me says things like “ fuck trump” lmao

Considering Richmond and Virginia as a whole has been a hotbed for protests and divisiveness, I wouldn’t call my analysis a stretch at all… just talk to anyone around campus like foreal.

I’m willing to bet my bottom dollar that you are maidenless

DO NOT GO TO THERAPY THURSDAYS hey so there have been multiple recent cases of people getting roofied/drugged at therapy aka old chas. people are foaming at the mouth and getting sent to the hospital. there are many recent cases of both girls and guys getting drugged. please watch your drinks and do not let a stranger buy one for you. it’s really dangerous there, i highly recommend going to a different bar.

This happened to people i know at cha cha’s a few years ago too!

Just a PSA to women to RVA beware of a man who goes by Jvon. His ig is @jvon_m. He frequents Therapy which used to be ChaChas in Shockoe. He is a sexual predator. Therapy in the last few years has also had several occurrences of women being drugged and SA’d. Hopefully one day he will be held accountable but for now, just giving a warning. You will always see him by himself no matter which space you see him in. Do not let him buy you drinks!

anyone else really bad with online classes? probably not a novel observation but it's fun to vent i guess. zoom gives me hella anxiety, and it's weird but i think the classroom environment just helped provide much-needed structure and motivation? meanwhile now there's nothing preventing me from starting every assignment at 11:30 pm the night before they're due and it doesn't really feel all that sustainable. kinda considering just dropping all of my classes this semester because of it

If it makes you feel any better a lot of us teachers and professors are also struggling. I normally look forward to the semester starting but this year I'm a ball of nerves and I already know I'm gonna end up getting things done at the absolute last second.

i zone out soo hard in zoom lectures, i hate it

Yea feels like im forcing myself to do khan academy for some of my classes

It's helpful to find a workspace and consistently go there with the mindset to get stuff done daily. Don't do your homework in bed, it drags on and you'll get distracted. A desk, good (or preferred) lighting. Make sure it's comfortable so you can get into the working zone. I can't concentrate if I'm freezing so at home I have a mini heater under my desk but in the dorms I just wrap up in a blanket at the desk. Fill out a calendar/agenda and work to stick to it. Give yourself awards, if you complete this, this ,and this then you will treat yourself to a cookie today or an episode of some show you like as your break before going back to work. I've been in online school since the 4th grade through my first semester of college, so I have a lot of experience of what does and doesn't work for me. Yeah it takes a LOT of self discipline but once you get down a routine, online will feel easier than in person at times. Being in a classroom does have advantages with giving motivation and structure but when you go online, you have to create your own motivation and structure your work yourself. Things will get better, if you work and have a positive attitude you will adapt faster.

yes, as someone who already has pretty shit discipline and motivation, the online system isn't particularly doing me any favors. I think it's better than last semesters shit-show though.

My roommate says its a little better to be in class in the library, kinda simulates the classroom feeling. I have yet to try it personally but its not a bad idea.

I’m here with y’all, I’ve absolutely loved college up until this point but I’m genuinely worried for this semester, I’ve never dreaded attending classes before now

If it's any consolation, that's exactly what work feels like too.

My professor had us read 50 pages of a textbook because he canceled one of our classes. This is cock and ball torture.

This summer I forced myself to log into my instructor's Zoom office hours once a week. I rarely had any questions/concerns and the class was not hard, but I needed to create structure and routine for myself so that was the best way I found to do it. Most of the time, I just showed up and talked about a part of that week's reading I found interesting or considered pros/cons of different project topics I was considering. I'm doing that again this semester and so far it's going well.

I dropped any intentions of taking classes this semester in part because I knew I couldn't handle online classes. They really are rough for some people, nothing to be ashamed of.

if I wasn't graduating this year I would've taken a semester off. On top of online classes, I have to study for the GRE and it's going miserably. I'm genuinely scared I'm going to fail this test

That does make me feel better.

Hi genuinely scared I'm going to fail this test, I'm Dad👨

A relaxing elevator ride in the time of covid 🤗

Everybody stand in the elevator corners like you're in the final scene of the Blair witch project

Do they really expect people to follow this? Lol.

can't imagine how long this would take to get down/up in buildings like brandt/rhoads, even with reduced residence.

Might as well just take the stairs for extra exercise!

No premarital eye contact. 😂

I’m thankful I’m only on the second floor of my building, so the stairs are a good option. But it makes me wonder how full the stairs are going to be at any given time as well.

RIP fat people

i got this reference!

It's mostly to avoid legal liability in my opinion. If someone tries to sue VCU because they get COVID while here they need items like this to prove that they did everything they could, within reason, and weren't being negligent or reckless. It's also something they can say they told you to do but you didn't. Hopefully I'm just being cynical.

Please return my shoe Hey I was using the bathroom in the commons earlier today and I usually take my shoes off to pee and some thief snatched one of my shoes. It’s a black adidas shoe. Please leave it back in the bathroom Thanks

bro...... why would you take your shoes off in a public bathroom??? i’m genuinely curious

😂😂 By far the weirdest thing I’ve heard happened on campus so far.

Bro if u take ur shoe off to pee i feel like u deserve to have it stolen

you HAVE to be trolling smh this shit cant be real lol

Can we get this thread pinned?

I’ll keep an eye out for the man with one black adidas shoe

There's a cost to being a weirdo. This is the price you pay

I’m confused. Did you leave your shoes outside the bathroom when you went in to pee??? Were you walking on the bathroom floor barefoot or in socks???

There’s so many things wrong with this

But where did you put your shoes when you did the deed? Did you leave them outside the stall or something? You must've known that you can't leave anything in plain view here if you don't want it stolen. Also, I respect your weird fucking devotion to shoe hygiene, but there are so, so many better ways to go about this. Stand closer to the toilet, put your feet under the toilet bowl, sit down to pee, or just do it normally and take a second afterwards to wipe your shoes off. Or maybe wear shoes that you don't mind getting dirty. At any rate, I'm praying for your lost shoe.

https://imgur.com/gallery/E0UfmXB The sign outside of the commons my dude. Other guy was just letting you know that you have to have your shoes on.

No... No, not going to do that. &#x200B; Also, you're full of shit. There is no way you would take off your shoes to piss, and there is no way you would leave them away from the urinal or toilet to piss. You're retarded, and you can fuck off with this troll nonsense.

To be fair, it’s never happened before. And I just slipped them off and have them behind me, so as soon as I finish I jump back into them and walk out to wash my hands , so the mistake being my back was turned as well as being in a stall.

Rip this guy's shoe.

Lmao @ the retards who don't understand what a shitpost is.

Your shoes better be worth a lot of money if you’d rather piss on your socks. Just sit down at that point

This man is a legend, I salute the commitment.

I’ll return it to the info desk at commons if I find it. Hope you find your shoe bro

Asking the right questions.

So I don’t possibly get it on my shoe........? Thats not common practice?

Who takes one shoe though? I’d understand if they took both of them.

No haha I wasn’t barefoot. Double socks.

I was in the stall. Otherwise I’m pretty sure I would leave some sort of description of what the person looks like. But nevertheless I hope you do change your mind.

Wait wait so you’d rather piss on your socks rather than pissing on your shoes???

i’ve never heard of or seen anyone doing it lmao like just aim properly?? is it common practice fr?

Should just sit down to pee at this point.

99% sure it was just to fuck with the guy who took his shoes off before using the bathroom

why is it better to get your piss on your socks instead of your shoes??? I have so many questions about this💀

I couldn't see doing that in a public restroom, but wearing shoes at home definitely sucks.

Yeah I learned my lesson. I’d just have to keep them on or hold them

I can always get more socks Not always guaranteed to get the same shoes

but the disgusting stuff on the floor would just be rubbed IN your shoe instead of being on the outside in which case you could rinse or wash the soles? I don’t think you’ve comprehended the benefits of wearing shoes. not to mention if you add up the stupid amounts of socks you’ve gone through it could probably amount to the cost of a pair of adidas.

I wear inserts in my shoes so I do take them out and clean them regularly since they’re already out. So the idea isn’t completely alien to me. All in all, if you see some person with a rogue black adidas shoe, let me know please.

Thanks for taking this photo! I’m not on campus right now so this was nice to see :)

So great that my exam at 8 am tomorrow isnt cancelled. As a commuter who lives in a rarely plowed subdivision I really appreciate it!

I think they delayed till 10?

And the ice will only get worse after tonight :(

Yep got the text. Thank God

Me too man, I tried to go this morning and was super sad. Any ideas when it'll be fixed?

Richmond not having a major water crisis for six months challenge (impossible)

What’s Mcv gym

It’s open now. Since 12. I went on the bus to MCV gym for the first time lol

Super Sad? Isn’t that an Italian cured meat?

Medical campus gym. Just take the bus to get there

Awesome, ill head over after class, thanks man.

the single downvote is killing me 😭

Yeah it’s not bad, only downside is no track (I like to walk on the track)

Is it crowded?

It was empty when I first got there (like 10:45 or smth) and got a bit more busy as time went on but nothing insane

4 hours of Coding work just deleted cause VCU's fuck ass wifi reset I hate life

I mean no offense but you should save your work more often if it meant that much.

me when i lie

Better to learn this lesson at the beginning of classes instead of at the end. Sorry the lesson had to be so hard.

How did this happen?

Then perhaps code in an environment that does not do this. Or code locally offline.

Which class?

Why aren't you doing your text editing locally in an Emacs instance?

it's all fine it was just a workbook

i was doing a coding workbook that had like 20 modules each module takes like 20 mins my wifi reset and all the work was gone.

Does anyone know what this is about? I hope whoever is effected will be okay. Is there a GoFundMe or anything?

I heard on Sunday someone “committed” in their dorm at the honors building

5th floor honors building, a student ended their life. As someone who has lost many people in their life it sucks when someone dies especially like this. If anyone feels this way please please reach out to someone and if you feel you cant call a help-line, if you cant do that message me, just please reach out if you are struggling, you are not alone, I promise.

I never got this email, I had to hear from a friend

Man it's even more sad to know that that building is reserved only for first years, they were only just starting their life too

damn, so we all feeling it rn

Really awful that most students haven’t even gotten this email let alone heard about what’s happened from anything other than this reddit. VCU needs to work on it suicide prevention and outreach majorly. They completely dropped the ball on this.

We haven’t heard anything either (staff/faculty). Well at least my department.

My son lives in the room across the hall where it happened in the honors dorm. Apparent suicide

VCU employee here. So sorry for this loss to the student community. There is a Pause & Reflect tomorrow at 2:30pm at the Pace Center. If you need help, please seek it. Please ask anyone to help you. I wish you all peace during any difficult time you may have.

there it is again, that funny feeling.

Suicide Hotline: Call OR Text 988 You’re not alone, I promise.

i was wondering the same. i lived in the honrs building last year, 6th floor. that building was horrible to live in. i was severely struggling myself and nearly went the same way. not that im blaming the living conditions on what happened, but genuinely, if youve ever been in the honors building, you know its such a horrible place to be when youre having a mental health crisis. its so cold, lonely, and sad. and is quite literally a remodeled mental facility. my heart really really hurts for the poor kid. i hope their family and friends are doing ok.

Ikr that’s so sick

the family asked vcu to give them privacy during this time..

The goons who run VCU probably view suicide prevention as a part of DEI

Are you okay.

Downvotes don’t know bo

Who is that?

you’re disgusting. get help.

it’s a bo burnham song this reminded me of, not trying to be insensitive

I read it totally as a joke no worries, but wanted to check in

i’m okay thank you, this world is just sick and sad, mass emailing about a suicide bums me tf out

My other kid's school does it. I mean, they don't go into detail, but there have been a few student deaths over the three years.

i’d say it’s okay but it’s not… smh

Stop going to lectures sick, coughing, and not at least wearing a mask please I hear so much coughing and a lot of viruses are going around. Please please, if you have to go to class while sick, at least wear the mask where there is less of a chance of infecting multiple people around you! Anyone else notice this a lot? I always mask indoors and it feels like I’m the only one when I look around

I’m very grateful that most of my classes this semester don’t have required attendance. I woke up feeling like I was about to throw up this morning, and I decided to miss both of my morning classes since I could easily catch up. I ended up not throwing up and getting better throughout the day, but I’m glad it didn’t end up worse. WITH THAT BEING SAID please only skip classes if you actually need to, do not use and abuse it, because it will catch up on you

At Reynolds, they had free masks placed in pretty much every building as of one semester ago. Kind of insane I haven't seen anything like that at VCU. They shouldn't be tucked away anywhere, just let people grab them

Are there still masks in the vending machines?

Yes thanks for staying home!

Well, that's stupid.

Right? They should’ve kept them

Got accepted into VCUARTS!! I was notified on my application status as a transfer a couple of days ago, and I am so happy!! Can’t wait to see what the art program has to offer.

Congratulations!!! You’ll do great! I’ll drink to your accomplishment tonight 🫡🥳💯

I'm not sure what major you've chosen, but you should know that you're going to have to make some of your own fun to make the most of it. I hope you enjoy your time, but realize that some of VCU's majors are a bit odd. Kinetic Imaging for example is what a lot of people want to make of an animation track but it doesn't quite work that way.

Congratulations! Welcome to VCU!

Congratulations!!!!!!!!!!

Ahhh congrats!! Wishing everything goes well for you (:

Congratulations! Richmond is such a fun city and a great art city as well! There’s lots of opportunities and events related to different art departments. Welcome to VCU art!

“Can’t wait to see…” uh, shouldn’t you already know? Why else would you have applied? … That said – Have fun! I was accepted in ‘86 and had a fantastic time during and 20 year career from it.

Congratulations!!

Congratulations. Not sure why I was notified as I graduated college 16 years ago and didn’t go to VCU. but good luck just the same

congrats! i’m a current senior. feel free to ask any questions!

wow! congrats!

My daughter is applying this fall for entry in Fall 2024. Have heard it’s competitive. Her GPA is good at 4.9ish, solid courses. Did you meet with an admissions for a portfolio review before you officially submitted? She’s been drawing and painting since she was 5. She almost CAN’T stop, she just HAS too, lol. Tips on what they look for in a portfolio appreciated.

She is not sure, but her strengths are painting and drawing. Watercolor, photography (she won a Scholastics Gold key award in high school this year), digital art, pen and ink. She excels in oil pastels. Her paintings look like a photograph. She has sold some limited work. Not sure if she will like Graphic Design, but it’s possible. She has a job air-brush painting Tshirts as well right now. Her hope is to use her foundation year as a way to discover more fine arts she likes. She hasn’t had an opportunity to try sculpture, glass blowing, etc. I could see her straight out of school with a company but eventually (with business classes), as an independent artist.

Good for you! Both my kids attended VCU. Both were performing arts majors. One went a safer route after graduation (teaching). The other is a very successful voice over talent living her best life in LA. Give it all you got and enjoy the ride.

Damn. Who shit up your ass this morning?

What a weird thing to say on the VCU subreddit

You good man?

I applied March 15th

Does she have an idea as to what she wants to pursue after her foundation year (comics, animation, graphic design, etc.)? For foundation arts they tend to look for basic skills she can then build from: composition, use of value, rendering, use of color, figure drawing, etc.

Sorry, I replied but incorrectly to the wrong thread. Likely painting/printmaking, possibly photography. She’s going to take some business classes as well as she might venture out on her own independently after working with an employer post graduation.

this is sickening

I'm pinning this for a bit. If anyone saw something or knows something please reach out to VCU PD.

Creeps me out to think I worked on the third floor right next to the bathrooms only 4 hours later

I don’t understand why they can’t find the suspects… just look at the fucking cameras

Wtf I was in the library when this happened. This is sickening

I'm utterly disgusted and appalled.

Seems like this has been happening more and more since Almond Tate started going viral

The cameras saw it… lol

Same. I'm on the third floor almost everyday, and was supposed to go to study for an exam from 12-5. Ended up deciding to just stay in my apt and procrastinate for the day instead. It's all just alarming to think about, especially since Cabell is a comfortable hang out spot for me

I was thinking the same thing. Since the report gave a pretty precise time window of when the incident happened, it should be easy to find the suspects

my sister was saving for a vacation a couple years ago and was taking cash to the bank after an event in harris hall, but someone stole all of it and vcupd couldnt find the culprit nor did they call/message back to update even though the cameras are supposedly all “functional” for that one way entrance and we knew the exact 15-minute window of time when someone could have entered and stolen the cash. someone from the event actually talked to the culprit not knowing what had happened (either right before or after) and even gave a description tldr: most of the the vcu cameras probably dont even work

Same one we always lived in, with slightly more transparent public reporting

U mean Andrew Tate? the guy who actually has the balls to call out the lies and fake news media on THE SCAMDEMIC? Yeah good luck to u buddy hahaah

Wtf is wrong with u

Ya but vcupd are idiots 🤷🏼‍♂️

when I was at Auburn and sexual assaults were occurring, the perpetrator was a campus cop - not saying this is the case at VCU, but when the videos are being ignored....

Facts, whenever people claim “Oh no, society is so bad nowadays”, my response is always “Hahahaha if society nowadays makes you want to vomit, you’d pass out from learning how we were centuries ago”

Vcu has a disproportionate amount of shit that like bro (richmond in general too)

It's coming...

it actually feels really nice outside today :) enjoy it everyone

Why you posting this on the coolest day in months?

What about elevenses 😥

I made ratemyprofessors but for classes: Rate My Courses Hi Everyone, I have been working for some time now on this website [ratemycourses.io](https://ratemycourses.io/VCU) and I am really excited to share it with you. You can use this to look at reviews and get advice on courses you're interested in, as well as filter courses by department and level and compare these courses. You can also sort courses by difficulty, usefulness and the overall rating from reviews made by other students. I think if enough people start using it regularly. it's going to be essential when you're choosing your electives or just to get advice on courses you will be taking and know what to expect. Please let me know if there is anything that I should change or what features I should add. Lastly, filtering and sorting courses is only gonna be useful and accurate if there are a lot of reviews, so please go ahead and leave some reviews to courses you've taken or are currently taking. Enjoy!!

Courses change year to year, both the curriculum and often who is teaching them. The info will become obsolete very quickly

I get it, and I don't mean to shit on the idea as a whole, but also if you're not reaching out to upperclassmen to learn about courses they took youre not going to learn much

Quick reminder before tonight's game

Post of the year

Childhood Cancer Scammers I know this post is a little late, but better late than never I guess. You may have notice this week on campus these volunteers on campus working next to these blueish-green tables for an organization called the American Children’s Cancer Benevolence Fund. If you do some simple research about them, you’ll find out that they are actually a **scam organization.** What these volunteers will do is that they will come up to you, sometimes going as far as to block your path, and ask you a trivia question like “name a state that begins with D.” No matter how you answer, they will then switch the conversation over to the organization, and then pressure you into making a minimum donation *two hundred dollar* donation. If you say that you don’t have the money or that you’re in a rush to get somewhere, they’ll get really aggressive with you, and have even said to some people things like “oh so you don’t care about kids with cancer.” If they manage to successfully convince you to donate, there have even been instances where volunteers have been seen taking pictures of people’s credit cards behind their back, which if that has happened to you, then you should put a credit freeze on your account ASAP. While it is not fully known where the money actually goes, considering the ridiculously high “minimum” spend and the lack of evidence that they actually do support kids with cancer, it is safer to assume that this is a scam. It is very disturbing and angering that these types of people are taking advantage of students on campus. They will also sometimes instead appear as an organization called the ASDF, which is an “autism organization” that also uses the same scam tactics as the ones they use for ACCBF. I don’t know why VCU has been allowing them to be on our campus for so long, as they have been popping up for years. Nonetheless, please spread the word, and please stay safe out there. Thanks y’all.

Yeah ngl they got me last semester for like 15 bucks cause i didn't realize they were a scam, but it was mad awkward. they were asking for like 250 bucks initially, like LMAO you're on a college campus in Richmond who has that

Because VCU is a public space, it's not that easy to simply kick an organization off of the property unless you have some sort of proof to share with the VCUPD and Administration. Unfortunately this group seems to have been able to register as a non-profit, but then again so do most Bible thumping Televangelists and those can be some of the scammy-ist people on the planet. That being said, people like this are looking for the weak and no matter how many times you say "No" they will keep persisting. The best thing to do is walk away from them, if they keep trying to stop you you need to escalate it to "Fuck Off" and if they keep insisting you up it with "Unless you want Mace in your Face, Fuck Off". For many of us, being this crass doesn't come naturally, which frankly is a good thing, but it is something that you all should practice with your friends for *when* you run into something like this in your life, because you will. And you should absolutely never give your card info to any of them, and only use a burner/junk e-mail account for things like this...

I started telling them I have cancer

Thanks for helping spread the word. I've tried to research this organization and haven't been able to find much, which is concerning. Even if they're using the money for charitable purposes, the scammy fundraising techniques are terrible. I've seen posts about them on other college campuses, as well, and it seems like they try to take advantage of college students. I'm embarrassed to admit that they did get me once. I agreed to talk to them thinking that I could at least take a brochure or give them a $5 bill (charities usually take small cash donations), they tried to get me to give them a large amount, and I ended up giving them a smaller donation against my better judgment. They tried to get me recently with that "Name a state that starts with \_\_\_" opening, and as soon as I said I couldn't give anything, the person completely lost interest in me and pivoted to someone else. It was almost funny how obvious it was that they were just looking for a mark.

Girl walked up to me asked “What’s the only state that ends in the letter K?” I dropped “New York” immediately and brushed right past her. Maybe I would’ve stopped and thought about it if it hadn’t been the third time I’d been asked the same question by these people 😐

Those dudes pressured me into donating $50 when I was a sophomore! Luckily I was able to contact the "organization" and get my money back😅 But yeah, screw them. I usually try to avoid them when I can👍🏾

I had this happen to me at the petco in chester last year.

one the guy was to cute. He fr started flirting with me complementing my hair and eyes and I lowkey fell for it which unlike me lol and led me to the table. I am really interesting in pediatric cancer research so when he mentioned it I was immediately interested. We started talking lil more asking for my information for the "scam" than when he told me to donate I left immediately and told him I have to get to class and his whole mood change. I didn't know it was $200 minimum cause I saw their was bottom for $200, $500 and $1000 but I didn't know it was the minimum whattt

Bro they got me like a month ago for 100! They were by BMCC so if you go to BMCC just walk by them don’t interact with them at all bro

They’re hoping your parents’ credit card is in your wallet.

“Now give ME $200 please, unless you don’t care about people with cancer.”

Panda Express stop scammin me bruh Got a 2 ENTREE PLATE with two entrees of broccoli beef and side of rice. Literally got 4 pieces of beef bruh come on. Has anyone experienced this where they put way too much side and no protein.

Judging by the Panda express “join our team” sticker on the table, go back to the counter & tell them

Inflation and Shrinkflation.

Why r u posting this while sitting in the restaurant

This is why I never do online orders. They give small portions whenever I don’t watch them make the order in front of me.

dont be on the meal plan is the real answer to that

That stuff is so easy to make at home. I don’t know why people even bother to eat in restaurants.

Where’s the meat

Never been through that damn

Why didn’t you say anything when they made it? lol…. They make the food in front of you.

broccoli beef is supposed to be 70% broccoli and 30% beef hope this helps!

I don't think they're actually even hiring, I know several people who've applied and have not heard anything back. These are people with experience in restaurants, good availability, and good interview skills as well. Seems weird.

I did. They said “we are not obligated to give you more beef”.

I wanted to check to see if they put enough beef because this happened the past time and I led it slide. went up to the counter and they replied with “we are not obligated to give you more beef”..

Not for online orders they don’t… lol…

I did and they said we aren’t obligated to give u more and tbh I just walked out bc wtf 😭😭

Is this a reasonable serving

Huh? I was referring to OP still being in the restaurant because of the sticker on the table. Him writing this makes zero sense since he is still there

well apparently theyve been shit to their employees

As a manager at a different restaurant chain, hiring signage usually always stays up all the time because whether we are actively hiring changes all the time

I woulda been obligated to Kung Fu Panda them 🧐 That sucks

The workers there are dog$hit. A person in front of you will ask for more of something and they’ll do it, maybe they know each other, but if you ask - you get the saying “ we are not obligated to give you more…company policy….” Such BS. They don’t even fill up the container!!

oh then that’s for every restaurant when you order online they be scamming

Seriously I hate how even when they do it internally(not through a high fee platform like doordash), they both charge more and lower the portions.

Vaccines Mandatory for Fall Semester VCU announced today that vaccines will be mandatory this fall, and must report their vaccination status by July 15th: Vaccination Vaccines are now widely available and have proven to be some of the safest, most reliable and effective vaccines in history. Public health experts tell us that vaccination is the best way to help keep ourselves and our community safe. • For the fall semester: Vaccination will be required for all students who live, learn, work or will be on campus for any reason (excluding those with religious or health exemptions). Survey results show strong majorities of students, parents, faculty and staff support this requirement. Students attending fall classes must report their vaccination to [University Student Health Services](https://health.students.vcu.edu/immunizations/submitting-immunization-records/) **no later than July 15**; Health Sciences students and those taking summer classes should receive and report their vaccinations sooner, if possible. Students who receive a two-dose vaccination must report completion of both doses. This requirement will allow our students to safely learn, live, gather and experience college at its best. For more information about full vaccination, documentation requirements, religious and health exemptions, and vaccine manufacturers, see the [student vaccine FAQ.](https://together.vcu.edu/faq/student-vaccine/) • Students who receive vaccination exemptions must follow safety guidelines for their health and for the health of our community, including but not limited to: wearing a mask, routine surveillance testing, completing daily health checks, and continuing to follow public safety measures including quarantine procedures. Entry Pass requirements will apply and entry will be allowed if the proper public health measures are followed. • Vaccinated students are exempt from masking, daily health checks, surveillance testing and quarantine requirements. [Entry Pass requirements](https://together.vcu.edu/public-health-measures/entry-pass/) will continue to apply; however, your Entry Pass will default to a green check. If you have not yet received your COVID-19 vaccination, you can make an appointment on-campus through University Student Health Services or at a provider near you (search vaccine availability at www.vaccines.gov).

Hurrah! I would have been really ticked off if we didn't require vaccinations. So many college students spread covid too much last school year so it would be nice to feel safer this year and end this pandemic faster

Glad to hear it! I’m very relieved that things are finally starting to slip back to normal.

Does this apply to MCV as well? Like hospital employees and everyone?

Will classes go back to being in person this fall?

litty. no masks required either

I got two emails. One said report it by July 15th and another said July 9th I don’t know which is correct

Probably. Most hospital employees were already required to get a flu shot every year. They have always required more immunizations than Monroe park campus students.

There were already some in-person classes as well as hybrid. The question now is are they going to add more seats to the in-person and hybrid classes, shift the hybrid classes to be fully in-person, and shift any of the online-synchronous or asynchronous classes to in-person? and that kind of stuff they haven't announced yet.

Aka Jehova witnesses

Yes you can get into VCU PSA as I keep seeing posts that are asking if you can get into VCU. Yes you can. Due to the global cold going around enrollment numbers are down. They need people who are paying customers.(That is you) VCU is probably a safe bet. Don't worry they need $$$..come on in! Per the website.. "Our projected budget deficit is of historic proportions. The costs associated with COVID-19 are enormous. In mid-April they eclipsed $50 million, including $13 million in lost revenue principally due to refunds and credits to students. These costs are mounting every day." To give some perspective, 1% of undergraduate tuition this year generated about $2.7 million. https://news.vcu.edu/latest/key-issues/University_Update#:~:text=Our%20projected%20budget%20deficit%20is,costs%20are%20mounting%20every%20day. Edit : fixed some spelling and some grammer. Close enough for VCU ;)

I had 2.8 GPA and a 1030 SAT and did a 180 with my life after high school. VCU is waiting for people who want to change their future and forget their past.

Lowkey hope this gets pinned bc i want this sub to stop being flooded with the same question

" 1% of undergraduate tuition this year generated about $2.7 million " is the most ass backwards corporate jargon way I've ever heard of saying tuition generated 270 million

its amazing how many of these smart high school students with like 3.5s and 4.0, have 0 critical thinking and googling skills. You can literally google the acceptance criteria and rates lmao. I hope the mods pin something, because these posts are annoying af.

Anyone know anything about these guys?

Did a quick google search and it appears they are construction workers who have worked on a bunch of the recently constructed buildings on campus. They claim that VCU is outsourcing the payments of these workers to contractors that are not paying what they are owed. [Here is there facebook post](https://www.facebook.com/EASCarpenters/posts/1897507370385077) that has some evidence supporting their claim and a link to a website to send a letter to Rao.

I don't get the unnecessary negativity in the comments. smh

I talked to them for a while, trying to figure out if their complaint was actually against VCU, or if it was against a contracting company, and they were using the VCU identify (their pamphlets do have the official VCU brand on them) to grab attention. It was weird, they guy didn't really seem to know much and just offered to give me the address of their union's website.

If people are not being paid working on projects at VCU ... VCU can exercise some rights with their employers. There is a VCU fee associated with them acting on behalf of workers. Oh no? Put a hold on the account. Initiate fundraising snail mail stat. Contact Nationwide for the co-op. Workers? What workers?

I think Rao stole their girlfriends

They look bored.

I believe it. They aren't releasing loan funds yet either.

As someone who has worked for a contractor or been in the construction industry for over a decade, VCU had absolutely no control over the contractor's payroll practices. Furthermore, VCU is compelled by state law to have an open bidding process and pick the lowest bidder since they are using public funds as part of their capital building funds. So, they can't disqualify a contractor for how they pay their workers. The workers' best bet is to take their complaints to the AGCA (if their employer is a member), the DPOR, or dept of labor and industry.

This was my first thought also. "VCU paid my employer who didn't pay me! Fuck VCU!" What kind of logic is that?

And don't forget it!

My Sister's in VCU so I drew this for her

Actually sick. I like the decision to not color it in

I like it :) I would buy a shirt with this design on it

VCUarts will be calling you

thats nuts what the hell

Looks like you should go to VCU

If you are any good at doing this type on stuff on virtual I would pay you a commission to make this a desktop background

that's very good!! do you take comissions?

Thanks dude! Tbh I dont really color in much of anything I do but yeah

I might, but I'm still looking around and all

I could easily translate it over. I have it already scanned

I mean, I could. Ive never done that before though

well it could be a new experience!

Yeah, I'd be down

To the people who are selling cats/kittens in front of the Library PLEASE BRING THEM TO A SHELTER INSTEAD. Letting a bunch of college students hold the kittens while the cat mom is hiding in the crate is NOT BETTER THAN THE ANIMAL SHELTER. The kittens are the cat mom are obviously stressed and curled up with airplane ears. As a cat owner, I can't imagine putting my cat in that situation.

STOP USING THEM AS PICTURES PROPS

They don’t even allow pets in the dorms, a lot of apartments also charge hundreds of dollars deposit and monthly rent for a pet; not to mention all the money you have to spend on cat supplies like food and litter and vet care.

Someone I know bought one for 100$ and the poor thing literally has fleas undisclosed to them. They are knowingly selling flea ridden kittens to a bunch of poor dorm/apartment living teenagers and 20 somethings knowing how easily it could spread to other animals not to mention other rooms...they luckily live in a dorm that allows animals for free but they also have a emotional support dog. If they didn't catch the fleas the hour after they brought her home they could've easily spread to their dog and maybe even their entire floor.

this is actually crazy because a group of people came to my dorm late sunday night with a kitten. they thought it was mine (i have a 8 month old esa who is practically infamous on my floor) and told me they found it just roaming the hall on the tenth floor. im guessing some careless person bought the kitten and it got out into the hallways at 12am. it couldn’t have been more than 3 weeks old.

RPD spokesperson: Eight people arrested in hazing death of VCU student

shouldve been charged with involuntary manslaughter at least some of them

Thank God .

They all need to go to jail for life

https://www.reddit.com/r/rva/comments/puq83t/rpd_spokesperson_eight_people_arrested_in_hazing/he4ketl/

oh thanks for linking that, i didn’t know they were already charged w other stuff

Anyone else feeling the effects of not having a spring break? I have never felt as stressed about finals as I do currently. COVID has given me a lot of time to study, but doing that for 3 semesters of studying all day has taken its toll. I'm on MCV campus and within the last 2 weeks of semester I have 7 exams.. and only take 4 courses... My grades show when I don't study because of how much material we have to learn, but at the same time I am told to give some time to myself, but how when all your classes are as demanding as anatomy, organic chemistry and physiology as the MPC classes are.

Yeah they definitely fucked all of us with that. Have 3 papers due this week as well as an exam and really wish we would have had something to give us a break

I really thought that since most if not all courses were online this semester it'd be easy for professors to give us a "pseudo break" on their own terms and not assign us anything for a week or something. I guess I was dumb for thinking they'd be so generous lol. I have 2 exams, 1 essay, and 2 big final art projects due this week and I've never felt so overwhelmed lol. At least the end is finally in sight

I believe in your ability to get shit done despite drained batteries OP.

I'm literally in the worst mental-health headspace I've been in since junior year *high school.* So yeah, I'm feeling the effects of not having a spring break all right.

You’re definitely not alone in that. I think everyone feels at least a bit like that right now. As long as I don’t fail, I think I’ll be happy at this point. I’m just looking forward to next semester when we’ll finally be able to put the constant deluge of information they have been inundating us with to some use and have way less/easier tests.

Ask for a incomplete on papers you need more time on. You can turn stuff in after the semester is over.

Getting shit done despite drained batteries is pretty much how I'd describe how to succeed as an adult. Appreciate the silver lining that this semester is preparing you for the real world out there. 9 to 5s are horribly draining, and they're probably one of the easiest adult schedules out there. Learning how to deal with this and be independent in learning are absolutely huge for your progression from student to employee. You have to learn how to put on hard hours of work you don't want to then go home and do that some more to peogess your career to a point where the work becomes interesting again.

If you want to avoid covid at this point, stop hanging out with anyone I promise you vcu has way more cases than they report because they're only pool testing. The cross contamination between just hanging out with a few people and all of the people they interact with is starting to get dangerous. Hate to say it but VCU has no control over this situation.

You can hang out with people just do it with masks 6 feet apart outdoors. Seriously, we’ve been doing this for months people.

Just follow the rules and we will make it out fine, I swear after covid, the world will get a big pizza party!!

We really haven’t though. America has fuckin botched this

This is how the virus evolves into the new strain :)

Some people have, but I just had someone do the fucking nazi salute at me and get in my face for pointing out that they need to wear a mask, right in front of the library. So tired of little shits coming here and thinking they own the place.

I don't trust anyone living in the dorms to not have covid tbqh. But that's just me

Too late for that. Heading into winter with all these cases = bad

Only if we get to shame the least valuable players.

add it to the pile

Yeah the heat and humidity has lowered it for a bit. Now everyone will be indoors with each other.

When we lose I'm flaming them

Trumps newest advisor to this pandemic is I’d suggesting that we just let everyone get it to “build immunity”

Hi flaming them, I'm Dad👨

fuck that shit, vote him out

NOT LIKE THIS

VCU Protests Tonight Does anyone know if the "Violent Protest" warning VCU sent out is actually a violent protest, or is it police inciting violence?

Someone needs to get the footage and prevent the state and vcu from spinning this. I don’t care what people’s opinions are about the conflict. These students have been chill and peaceful all day. Encouraging dialogue, song, and hydration. I’m not even part of this group. I agree on certain things they’re standing for and not other things they do. But that doesn’t change my ability to recognize that they weren’t harming anyone. I certainly am saddened and angered by the state police’s conduct here.

Consider this: they sent out a VCU alert saying “police on scene.” Then 10 minutes later they send an alert saying “violent protest”. Let’s connect the dots… who caused the violence?? (Not to mention the literal video proof of protestors being 100% peaceful and police being disgustingly violent)

Update: it looks like they have made several arrests

Air raid sirens going off again for the 3rd time @9:14pm

Can confirm. It was kids chanting on the grass. No counterprotestors were present. I stopped by to bring a friend something to eat, that's how casual it was. They were just standing there, and then a bus full of riot police and cars blocking the streets for two blocks.

Police inciting violence. They bussed in state police in full riot gear at night and immediately reported to using sound blasters and pepper spray. So so scary to witness I feel bad but I just left as soon as I saw them with the shields

My gf who is hours away from me was just trying to study for her final at the library and her friend was already inside. Things went crazy and her friend got trapped inside the library and the gas they were spraying like crazy was getting inside the library and she was coughing and having a hard time breathing. They didn’t do a thing but are paying the price for it. I’m happy to say they were able to get away from it all but the friends car is completely blocked in by police cars and can’t move it. Who knows what could have happened it’s just terrible.

I mentioned this in the RVA subreddit, but I have a feeling part of the reason why there was such a large police response may have to do with Youngkin decreeing today that any encampments on state university property will not be tolerated, and with the capital just down the street they are using this instance to set an example...

Came here to see if anyone knew anything else too. I heard that police used tear gas on the crowd at Cabell but that's just from word of mouth.

Here’s a Twitter thread by a journalist there with more info: https://x.com/jahdkhalil/status/1785104635633512577?s=46 Edit: clarification

It's police inciting violence. They did the same shit with every previous mass protest.

I am getting VCU messages to stay indoors Sound like the police are there

sirens are going off wth

police inciting violence

police pepper sprayed 2 of my close friends, everyone was peaceful and chill. vcu's response was horrendous

It was initially peaceful and chill, the school set guidelines for them. Can't be on the campus occupying the space after a certain time, not to block off any access ways or have any structures and they quite literally did all of that. The school campus is private property and they were told to stop or they would be charged with unlawful assembly and trespassing, police showed up to remove the barricades made out of pallets and other wooden objects, and to remove them from the property. as soon as the police started removing the barricades they (the "peaceful protesters") began throwing things and pepper spraying the police. in simple terms. They did not listen, they fucked around and they found out

https://twitter.com/SamuelParkerRTD Take a look at his twitter

I mean, at most they were, what? Trespassing?

https://x.com/GoadGatsby/status/1785112806980747488

I definitely thought it was the police originally but it's important to check facts, no need to be condensending :/

I mean, it was good an alert went out, there was pushing back (literally) when the police were shoving riot shields in people’s faces.

Thank you for keeping us informed, god I wish I knew what to do about this. I hate that we're powerless against them

My good friend is an extremely peaceful person. She was pepper sprayed.

That's outrageous. Thank you for letting us know

Fuck. What sense does that even make I hate this shit.

Absolute insanity. How is that a reasonable response

Oh no. This is gonna get really ugly

That happened to me! Do you know if she was on the 3rd floor porch? We all started coughing and ran to close the windows.

I’m a VCU alum and am no longer in Richmond. I’m not there, I don’t know what’s happening. But the encampments and the outside protestors (not university affiliated) are what’s killing all of the other campus based protests. If they can find a way to avoid those things, they could be successful. I know very little about the law. I feel the encampments being unlawful could be up for debate. But the outside protestors always give the universities an easy excuse to break the protests up.

Honestly, I feel like I'd be scared to go to commencement if Youngkin goes, considering how tonight went.

i saw students fleeing from that area saying the same so id say safe to assume it’s true

They used tear gas, there are videos on Twitter, it's horrible. They used tear gas within 20 minutes of arriving and are actively still using it

I was there. They did. I have video of it.

I was in Richmond for about a decade, left in 2014. They gassed us all through March Madness when we made it to the Final Four. They gassed us on First Fridays when teenagers started showing up. They’re real gas-happy. Edit to add: I don’t remember this ever happening in the first 5 years, just the last 5.

definitely not the police, each of those incidents the "Peaceful protesters" (rioters) were given ample opportunity to disperse and leave the area, but no one complied with the lawful orders. Fuck around, find out. its simple. You're told its an unlawful assembly and to disperse, you disperse and nothing happens. you choose to stay and begin throwing things at the cops, you get sprayed and arrested. not a hard thing to avoid

I actually saw them! The cameraman had to run inside to the bathroom for like 30 mins before going back out.

Goad also does good work: [https://twitter.com/GoadGatsby](https://twitter.com/GoadGatsby)

Sorry I wasn’t trying to be condescending, i was just being sarcastic bc I’m absolutely sick of vcu

Good to know local folks are more ok with fascist police than with college kids expressing their views.

thats so fair ❤

VCU Considers Withdrawing Students Whom Haven't Reported Their Covid Vaccination According to [this article](https://richmond.com/news/local/vcu-is-reconsidering-its-policy-on-allowing-unvaccinated-students-to-attend-in-person-class-450/article_07ba4a10-1928-528b-9aff-4b4dd7e66d4d.html#tracking-source=home-the-latest) from the Richmond Times Dispatch, after several professors raised concern about unvaccinated students without exemptions who are attending classes, VCU is reconsidering it's current policy of simply placing a hold on students accounts and instead withdrawing them from their classes. And if they are living in housing, they will be kicked out of that as well. Currently there are ~450 students who have not reported their status and haven't gotten an exemption, so if you're one of those, you better get hoppin' because a reckoning may be comin' like at VT where they gave several students the boot...

It;s ridiculous that they haven't yet.

Good. Do it

Some more info about the fall semester Just spoke with my counselor about some stuff, and she mentioned that in general, vcu is planning on moving any class over 50 people to entirely online (lower class sizes will be hybrid/in person). Professors will also be expected to let us know what the format for each specific class will be no later than July, although you can reach out beforehand if needed. I'm sorry if this info has already been posted elsewhere, this was new to me and figured I'd let yall know.

That's pretty interesting since almost all my classes have more than 50 seats and are completely filled. Kill me now! But thanks for the information :)

Thank you, now I don’t necessarily have to email every professor asking about the class format every time.

thanks for letting everyone here know

Thank you! No need to apologize even if this info was posted somewhere else--you got the word out!

Man if I didn't have biology research I'd have entirely online classes again. :o I'm kinda glad I have an excuse to be in Richmond. I can't do another semester trying to concentrate at my parent's house.

This email was sent out earlier today. It's official. >Dear VCU faculty, staff and students, > >As outlined in the university’s [ONE VCU: Responsible Together](https://orange.hosting.lsoft.com/trk/click?ref=znwrbbrs9_6-258d6x322bd7x022872&) plan, our phased return to campus will include changes to class formats and instructional spaces.

dude, i sincerely wish you good luck in staying healthy!

Thank you! You too! I hope everyone stays healthy :)

Already sick Is anybody else sick right now?? I’m having the scratchy throat symptom, which means I have 30 secs before the actual sickness hits. I’ve never gotten sick this early in the fall semester. Like, wtf, we just started.

There is an uptick in covid cases right now, additionally as the seasons begin to change there’s generally a trend of coronaviruses spreading more frequently. Don’t know the specifics or science off the top of my head, just take it easy and keep yourself well rested and increase your fluid intake

Definitely get a Covid test if you haven’t already

Get all your shots and wear a mask y’all! Illness is up and everybody coming back to college in a big mixing pot makes it worse.

My daughter has covid already… it’s only been 2 weeks 🤦🏽‍♀️

I tested positive for Covid yesterday. First time. Feel awful. Hope everyone feels better!

OMG YES! My roommate got sick a few days ago and now I’m sick too 😭 definitely something going arojnd

Had to pick up our son yesterday from GRC. He picked up strep already so if it gets bad, go to the doctor and get a culture done. Strep won’t go away without antibiotics. Good luck and feel better soon! - internet Dad

i think everybody is getting sick. 1 in 3 people i know have come down with something in the last week including myself. it isn’t too bad, i think it’s due to the start of school and a lot of bodies are around each other in unfamiliar places.

I was sick the first week of school, cough fever 100F+ for a full week. I was not happy about it. I’m doing better now, voice is on the mend and I sound normal and not sick. I think there is flu going around the campus of some sort. I was not covid positive thankfully.

I was sick for the entirety of my first semester on campus. Be sure to go to student health and have it documented for your professors.

Not on campus but I volunteer nearby with a bunch of students & had COVID last week (tested positive two days after my last volunteer shift). It was awful. Throat, full body aches, coughing, absolutely no breathing out of my nose, headaches, earaches… fucking mess Test fast so you can get started on Paxlovid ASAP. Took me two days to find a pharmacy with it in stock.

Scratchy throat and slight fever yeah

My friend has a sinus infection ;(

This past week I’ve been sick, still recovering but I feel almost 100%! Make sure every chance you get you wash your hands and try not to touch your face beforehand. Also wiping down surfaces like your door, door handle (inside and outside handle) and sink handles with wipes can also help.

You can go to CVS minute clinic and get tested for flu and Covid. There are cheap antiviral pills for both with insurance. There is Tamiflu for flu and Paxlovid for Covid. Tamiflu needs to be started 1-2 days after symptom onset. Paxlovid is a little more forgiving and can be started up to 5 days after symptom onset. You likely have Covid since there is a massive uptick in our community right now. Paxlovid binds to an enzyme in the Covid virus preventing it from replicating. This allows your body time to clear the virus and there is a reduction in symptoms within 24-48 hours. Much better than waiting it out.

u sure it’s not allergies.

Is SARS-2/Covid 19 still a thing?

I’m a teacher, been in school for 2 weeks and already have a cold 😣.

I work in the ER and we’re already seeing Covid cases. I got it already this year. Felt like razors in my throat for 3-4 days but no other real symptoms.

Yes! Be as safe as possible. Covid is on the rise

one of my friend’s roommate tested positive for covid a couple days ago, from the other comments it seems like it may be going around unfortunately

I've been sick since Thursday. Started with a scratchy throat and then on Friday it continued with a sore throat, nasal drainage and a nasty cough. Went to urgent care today and negative for COVID, Flu and Strep. Being sick sucks.

Yep no I no what u mean#UGG

VCU has a lot of people sharing a lot of spaces so sickness spreads FAST! Masks are effective against a lot of illnesses so I try to wear one inside on campus, esp in the fall

im always itchy and its so annoying but this never happened to me wtf is going on.

I hope that you feel better soon!

I just left the hospital for nerve damage and the doctor told me that I should’ve went somewhere else because they were 90% flu and Covid going around

yes bro i got the sniffles bad

It’s because kids went back to school now everybody getting sick

I can completely relate, unfortunately with the massive derailment of public health initiatives and everyone’s cumulative damage from repeated infections over the last five years, it’s been put on us to take time to work and mitigate the risk for one another, or stay perpetually ill. Despite the gloom and doom of that, I recommend getting in touch with the local mask bloc and getting situated with N95 and KN95 masks as well as tests! They’re incredibly friendly and often can drop off. Every break in the chain of transmission makes a difference, I hope you’re feeling well soon!

Suck it up buttercup

bro yes i thought i was safe until like november but nope here we are already dying a few weeks into the semester

Everyone down voted me for stating the fact that the covid vaccine is extremely dangerous and is more lethal than the virus itself. The world needs more free thinkers and less sheep that just follow blindly

hoping it’s just allergies 😞

i think it’s just allergies i was dying earlier this week and my car is coated in pollen

Allergies are absolutely killer right now, but most people tend to get sick within a week or two of moving onto campus. If you don't feel better by Tuesday, definitely go see a doctor.

It’s officially flu season 😮‍💨

You can get a “free” COVID-19 test as well as Flu/Rsv/etc panel if you go to the emergency room if you have insurance through your parents or purchased on your own or I offered through the school.

weak immune system

Haven't been sick in over a decade. Even last time I got sick, it was like a partial sickness. Still went to class and did my homework at a university. I think it's partially my genetics and then also due to my use of supplements and herbs.

The Covid shots are really harmful do not get them

Ughhhh awful :( I’ll be staying home and taking care of myself in the meantime! Stay safe

Also allergies, happens in tandem with season transitions as well

Ditto to this, there’s a variant that mimics a bad cold going around.

Yes!!! I’ll be in quarantine for the meantime 😷

You can no longer get COVID shots unless you are in a high risk group. Thanks, RFK.

I hope you feel better soon!

Thank you!! Hope your son feels better soon too!

I visited VCU last weekend and am just blown away I want to go into film and photography and everything from the campus to the resources to the entire first year arts foundation program were so amazing to me. I'm applying to around five other schools this summer, but I really feel like VCU might be the place I want to go the most. I'm going to set up a portfolio review with an admissions councilor soon so am looking forward to that. :)

Good luck!!! Vcu is a lovely place full of all different kinds of people! Hope you get in!!

It’s been decades since I did my first college tours but I remember that feeling exactly. Being embedded in Richmond, VCU really has an amazing arts community. No matter what your interests are, you’re bound to meet all kinds of crazy cool creative people.

I absolutely hated my first tour at vcu it was 105 degrees and out of 15 colleges vcu was the last after a long drive from Florida. then I got accepted and toured it one more time and I was promised sunny skies and warm weather in late February, but nope it snowed and rained. But I feel in love with the school and diversity and academics.

Good luck!! 🍀

What our admin should be sharing right now.

Nope instead we got an email that was literally addressed “Dear Colleague” to inform and mention the actual “Dear Colleague” letter

Yeah, wow. That’s a clear and effective letter. I don’t think the people who need to read it are super into reading long letters, sadly.

Here’s a good article written at a student-level of understanding. Most people hear “research cuts“ on the news and don’t understand what that actually means. https://slate.com/life/2025/02/nih-funding-cuts-trump-indirect-costs-grants-ruling.html?utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=traffic&utm_source=article&utm_content=web_share

NIH? You mean the Covid-is-from-bat-soup, no mask, one mask, 2 mask, stay home 2weeks, 10days, 7days, 5days, nevermind? THAT NIH? Fauci IS the “science”. That NIH? All cred gone.

You’re right. After that nonsense all your credibility is gone

You are joking, right?

Even for rage bait, this is quite weak.

Nope, and op also claims to be a doctor on another post lol. They also think people use abortion as birth control

VCU to require anyone covering their face on campus to show ID, among other policy changes

Actually for the last 10 ish years. Any student must provide ID on demand of a VCU admin. It was in the handbook for many years if I recall correctly. So this "mask" thing is not new thing for students. Edit: I should clarify any student masked, non masked is required to show ID apon demand from a VCU administrator. This requirement is not subject to the VCU police. Virginia is not a show your ID state. This means that, in general, you do not have to show your ID to the police if they stop you without a warrant or probable cause. (I am not a lawyer) Per VCU police: https://police.vcu.edu/facts/policies/1-5-arrest-and-legal-procedures/#:~:text=REASONABLE%20SUSPICION%20%E2%80%93%20Articulable%20facts%20which,unless%20it%20can%20be%20articulated. :REASONABLE SUSPICION – Articulable facts which lead an experienced officer to reasonably suspect that a crime has been or is about to be committed. There must be well‐founded suspicion based on the totality of circumstances. Reasonable suspicion does not exist unless it can be articulated."

Thank you for posting an actual neutral news link about this rather than a provocative, illogical, written post. It’s good for incoming students to know new policies. Since the provocative post was rightfully taken down, I will remind everyone that the mask policy is consistent with the preexisting facial concealment policies of state facilities…you aren’t allowed to conceal your face or carry weapons on state property. Additionally, students, staff, and faculty were always supposed to carry around their university ID while on campus, so that’s what they were referring to with showing “identification documentation”.

The policy isn't saying you can't wear a mask or hood, you just have to be prepared to show your ID. You're supposed to have your ID with you anyway.

So are we just going to pretend like a global pandemic didn’t happen or….

Bro this makes me so mad???? Like as an adjunct going between multiple colleges to teach this is so wildly stupid and irritating. What the hellllllll.

If VCU police have the authority to enforce VCU policy, then they can enforce this. While the state of Virginia does not have a law pertaining to the requirement of ID’ing oneself when asked by law enforcement, case law has upheld local ordinances requiring that within different localities in the state

And that is hasnt stopped

Nowhere, not anywhere is it stated or implied that you are not allowed to wear a mask.

This has been state law for a long time. It literally means nothing.

Is an adjunct a teacher?

No it's my reading and understanding that only VCU administrators can make demands of students. VCU police are not administrators.

I guess that’s true… it’s just ugh. 😓

That would make sense, and I’m sure that’s the case. Though that doesn’t mean a whole lot, because if a student wears a mask and refuses to identify themself to an administrator, they’ll be asked to leave the property, at which point they do, then PD can enforce state code which prohibits wearing a mask without identifying yourself, or they don’t leave, and get arrested for trespassing, which will lead to identifying the person. So with this policy in place, the person with the mask will most likely be identified one way or the other

how is it ugh? you need to carry your id to use your dining plan and access some areas anyways. this doesn’t change anything for anyone.

If your a student you are required to ID. Non student you can be asked to leave.

You have to look at the state code: 18.2-422. Prohibition of wearing of masks in certain places; exceptions. It shall be unlawful for any person over 16 years of age to, with the intent to conceal his identity, wear any mask, hood or other device whereby a substantial portion of the face is hidden or covered so as to conceal the identity of the wearer, to be or appear in any public place, or upon any private property in this Commonwealth without first having obtained from the owner or tenant thereof consent to do so in writing. However, the provisions of this section shall not apply to persons (i) wearing traditional holiday costumes; (ii) engaged in professions, trades, employment or other activities and wearing protective masks which are deemed necessary for the physical safety of the wearer or other persons; (iii) engaged in any bona fide theatrical production or masquerade ball; or (iv) wearing a mask, hood or other device for bona fide medical reasons upon (a) the advice of a licensed physician or osteopath and carrying on his person an affidavit from the physician or osteopath specifying the medical necessity for wearing the device and the date on which the wearing of the device will no longer be necessary and providing a brief description of the device, or (b) the declaration of a disaster or state of emergency by the Governor in response to a public health emergency where the emergency declaration expressly waives this section, defines the mask appropriate for the emergency, and provides for the duration of the waiver I would say covid 19 is a reason to rock a mask. https://health.students.vcu.edu/about/updates/covid-19/ Per VCU website Does it matter what kind of mask I wear? Use the most protective mask you can that fits you well and that you will wear consistently. *Choose a high quality disposable mask or a well-fitted cloth mask with at least 2 layers (3 layers is better!). Review CDC recommendations to maximize the fit and effectiveness of your mask.* That seems to be good enough for " or upon any private property in this Commonwealth without first having obtained from the owner or tenant thereof consent to do so in writing" I'm guessing there is half a dozen other things with the VCU letter head to say ware a mask. I know I have a bunch of there emails and PDFs about masks. I have the free masks they gave us all.

It’s the idea of over policing. Folks on campus going in and out of buildings are typically staff, faculty and students. Sure it’s fine, but just the fact that they need to be CHECKED to enter buildings with a mask is invasive and disregards the ongoing pandemic that is still spreading.

It’s all based on reasonable circumstances. “Because of Covid” is not a catch all, meaning anyone can conceal their identity with a mask at any time or any place. It’s all based on the totality of the circumstances. If a person is outside at 3am, looking into cars and trying to open car doors, wearing gloves, a hoodie, jeans, and a Covid mask when it’s 85 degrees outside, it’s pretty easy to articulate he isnt wearing a mask because of Covid

Legitimate user access is what keeps people out who aren't supposed to be there. The campus is already in the middle of the city. How else do you make sure people are staff, faculty, or students? Have everyone beep in to every door with a card?

ur literally right idk why ur being downvoted

remember in high school when we couldn’t wear caps or hoods so the cameras could see us? so that if someone shot up the school or assaulted someone they could be identified? same idea here but the adult version. its not revolutionary and exists in a lot of state facilities.

One of the leading crimes in the VCUPD daily log is trespassing. Also, no where does this say you WILL be or SHALL be checked for wearing a mask or hood. It simply says you CAN be.

You are correct. However if your in the library reading a text book and taking notes rocking a VCU hoodie. Probably not Walking to class with a mask on Probably not

Sure, which is why this policy will most likely really only be enforced when administrators have reason to think someone may be doing something they shouldn’t be doing

Yes so if your creeping around then you would have to show ID anyway Under the reasonable suspicion standard.

This policy is definitely in the case of someone concealing their identity at something like a protest

Dear VCU, I don't need 6 text messages about 1 fire over summer break. Thank you.

It do be a hot hot hot summer. As good as I look in dress clothes, I hate having to wear them for work...I avoid leaving the office as much as possible.

I wish there were a way to opt out of summer break VCU emergency system text messages but still get spring and fall notifications if you're not taking summer term courses or working on campus

I blocked them on every account, text line, app, all that shit fuck em

Why does this comment have so many dislikes

Bruh fr wth

Effective May 17, VCU students, faculty & staff who are fully vaccinated are exempt from quarantine, surveillance testing and daily health check requirements.

Yup, just make sure you scan and send a copy of your vaccine card to the appropriate link(s) otherwise you won't be in compliance. You can find the link(s) when you fill out your daily health check at the bottom of the page.

Link to how to submit your form here: [https://health.students.vcu.edu/immunizations/submitting-immunization-records/?fbclid=IwAR352jYSgx5ec\_QA97pA5DKEeujjijgdpvLB-LiCc6Tyj3wJPuu\_Fpv\_cOg](https://health.students.vcu.edu/immunizations/submitting-immunization-records/?fbclid=IwAR352jYSgx5ec_QA97pA5DKEeujjijgdpvLB-LiCc6Tyj3wJPuu_Fpv_cOg)

Thank fucking god they cant stop emailing me

I never did a daily health check lol Edit: I see all the downvotes so I should have added that I haven’t visited campus once in over a year so I did t ever see the point to.

I sent in my pdf files of vaccination provided from cvs... hopefully that’s good lol

Do you know if Student Health sends a confirmation once you’ve uploaded the document? I uploaded mine a few days ago and haven’t heard anything from them.

Unfortunately, I do not. As a full time employee and part time student, I only had to submit it using the redcap form, but that didn't seem to send me a conformation. You should be able to email folks in that office at ushsimmuniz@vcu.edu to get your question answered.

I say we ALL e-mail Rao and demand an explanation of his $$MILLION+ SALARY Someone suggested a template which I didn't consider in my pop-off rant this morning SO I WROTE ONE (feel free to edit or not use): Dear President Rao, In these unprecedented times of economic uncertainty and social instability, the exponential rise in university fees and tuition is felt by students everywhere. However, VCU stands out from other universities for a multitude of reasons, not the least of which is the staggering disparity between your salary and the hard-working professors, adjunct and otherwise. Professors with multiple degrees in their field make a negligible fraction of your salary, despite the fact they are the ones who cultivate the good name of VCU within the classrooms you merely profit from. You have consistently been the highest paid state employee and among the highest paid employees for well over 5 years as you saw the financial burden on students double in university fees alone, alongside an almost 7% tuition increase. You stated yourself to be a steward of public resources and trust, and I ask how you justify the financial decisions you have made in the name of bettering our education with our money in your pockets. A concerned student, xxx &#x200B; OG post: President Rao is absolutely decimating this university. Tuition has soared since he took charge and literally all of it has gone into his pocket. There is no reason he needs over a MILLION dollar salary in addition to a $25,000 bonus last year that took place behind closed doors. I say we all e-mail him ([president@vcu.edu](mailto:president@vcu.edu)) and demand an explanation for why he is putting students in debt to line his own pockets. Also this: [https://www.baconsrebellion.com/wp/want-to-advance-racial-justice-vcu-look-at-your-bloated-cost-structure-and-runaway-tuition/](https://www.baconsrebellion.com/wp/want-to-advance-racial-justice-vcu-look-at-your-bloated-cost-structure-and-runaway-tuition/) Edit 1: a visual of how drastically this mfer's salary has risen https://preview.redd.it/9k00viaiba551.png?width=1118&format=png&auto=webp&s=e4169506d86ae172972c5d40bf54a0befb45c287

Legions of full time VCU employees with terminal degrees make less than $40k and the administration happily lines their pockets while reassuring “low income” employees they don’t have to worry about furlough without stopping to ask why they have hundreds of employees that would be homeless if VCU cut their pay even a little bit. It’s nauseating.

So he is the President of a business with X amount of employees and overseas X amount students. Vcu- facts State . The university and health system is the largest single employer in the Richmond area, with more than 17,744 full-time and 6,490 part-time employees. 24,000 employees. (Roughly) 30,000 students. (Roughly) What is the comparison for other people in similar positions? Is the salary commensurate with the amount of responsibility? EDIT... I personally think his salary is way to much.

As a VCU grad, I just want to say that I support your message. I caution you to temper your expectations, and want you to understand that you will almost definitely be ignored. You are by no means the first group of students to protest Rao's ridiculous income, and how tone deaf he is in his "sympathetic" announcements about raising tuition. While I was in school, a group of students were given audience in his office "to show he cares". He listened to them as well as Trump listens to people making an appeal, and nothing changed. You could see the man thinking about where to go for lunch while the students expressed their concerns. Rao is a prick, but he always comes out on top. The teachers fear repercussions for speaking out, and the admins don't care because they're making bank too. &#x200B; Related, [here's another time](https://www.richmond.com/news/local/black-students-take-over-vcus-presidents-office-to-demand-changes/article_4a05d70e-99fe-539f-9097-8415205caafd.html) students were given an audience with him and he didn't listen or care.

First: Send this email to media outlets. Somebody outside the university system has to hold President Rao accountable if we want this to change. Second: Has President Rao taken a pay cut before pulling money from merit aid funds? Has VCU taken away financial aid? Was that decision made by VCU specifically? I didn’t see anything, but was there ever an email talking about losing aid money? Third: If VCU has been pulling funding from merit and financial aid without notice, absolutely speak to this effect this has on people who can afford to attend VCU BECAUSE of the aid they receive. People from less than rock solid socioeconomic backgrounds or who have been laid off because of the pandemic could really be suffering from this and might have to ask themselves if they can still afford to continue in higher ed because VCU has suddenly pulled funding from aid programs while the president is still sitting around a million dollar salary. Fourth: Yes, VCU froze tuition for this year, but that call was made BEFORE the pandemic; not because of it. If something is going on, and it can be proved, make it an open letter to President Rao, the VCU community, AND media outlets. It’ll have greater impact too if there are links to other articles/newsletters or something that can back up what’s going on.

What's even worse - because he makes such a ridiculous salary he'll never leave voluntarily. No one will pay him more than he makes at VCU. In a recent survey of compensation amounts for university presidents, [he ranked #45 out of 278 public college presidents](https://www.chronicle.com/interactives/executive-compensation#id=table_public_2018). [This page contains a searchable database of state employees](https://www.bizjournals.com/washington/news/2019/10/04/public-paychecks-who-earns-the-most-on-virginias.html) (scroll down a bit to see it). Note - it only lists employees making more that $50,000 / year. If you look up your instructor and their name does not come up, it's because they're making less than that figure.

What's the salary of other large state school presidents?

Here before we the bootlickers of this sub arrive going “he has a really hard job”

He is an absolute disgrace to this university and community.

Write a template and I’ll send it.

Yeah it is pretty damn insane

Thank you for the template! Do you mind if I share it on twitter and Instagram?

In case anyone was legitimately curious— it’s because he’s president of the university and the health system. The health system foots the bill for over half of his $1m salary. From the university itself he gets about $400k give or take, which is on par with popular Virginia schools.

That doesn't surprise me at all

I believe he attends VCU and resides in one of the residence halls.

I believe it. Rao is prick too. He got visibly upset once when I was out walking my dog and refused to let him do a photo op with the dog.

I’ve talked about this before on this sub, but yeah, he is. He was sent to some snobby Cali school after high school but now he goes here.

It truly is. THE most dedicated professor I have ever had addressed my class in tears last semester to say his position has been downsized. He had been there for 20+ years and loved what he did with every fiber of his being. It absolutely broke my heart to hear him to say that.

If you say he makes a million a year. A bonus that is %.025 of your salary is actually on the low end all things considered.

I agree. The only way to really see something done would be for an incredibly large, organized effort by students to not enroll at VCU until something is done. It would have to be very public that students will not enroll until XYZ is addressed and show what exactly needs to be done. Granted much easier said then done, because then you're essentially playing chicken with the University with your future. Gotta speak the only language they know, $$$$.

I honestly just made this post in a bought a defeated frustration this morning but yall have definitely motivated me to get serious about this. Gonna spend my day researching so anyone who has helpful input/opinions, I'm all ears

Quite high as well, but Rao consistently takes the cake and it's pretty jarring when you consider it against the increased financial demands on students, combined with the pitiful amount teachers are paid there. Not to say that isn't the case in many places, VCU is just personal lol

Not at all! Share away and feel free to edit what you please

Welp that seals it. If you care more about a photo op than giving pets to a deserving floof I DONT FUCKING TRUST YOU

Yeah, I TAed for a great professor who had written a couple books and was a scrupulous, thoughtful scholar - he lived in fear of administrator reprisal for any bad student reviews (which happen for both unfair and fair reasons) and made $50k. Dude had a PHD and a long teaching history and they started him at $50k, while admin makes ten times that routinely. This extends to all levels too, I don’t want it to seem like I only think people with multiple degrees deserve a living wage. Administrative bloat should be cut so we can do basic shit we are morally required to do like pay our cleaning, cooking, and maintenance staff an actual living wage with insurance, paid time off, and all the basic benefits they deserve for working forty hours a week. VCU is a microcosm of how capitalism has devastated higher education but it doesn’t have to be.

one time this year i was walking towards the compass and saw him coming toward me and he was so engrossed in his phone that he almost slammed into me AFTER i had already shifted myself to avoid running directly into him

Yeah, you can't trust Rao. My dog got plenty of love and attention during my VCU days. I'd stand out in MP, or the compass and let people pet her. But Rao wanted to crouch by her with me out of the picture, and do his thumbs up to show that he's good with animals and relatable. Probably would've scampered off to wash his hands afterwards if he had touched her.

I agree completely! Our entire vcu staff deserves more, not just those with doctorates. My family is from Richmond and I love this city. I think we can do much better and I say that out of reverence for our community.

VCU in talks to buy $275 million research building from Altria

So, this will be interesting to see how this plays out. The $275MM is what the building and property are assessed at by the city, and it is unlikely that is what VCU would pay for it for a few reasons including that the State would cover part of the costs and Altria may further offer the property at a discount as things like this look good when their lobbyists visit elected officials to get their agendas passed. Additionally, as part of the VCU Master Plan Sanger Hall, which was built before VCU even existed, is slated to be replaced because while it had some renovations to its lab space in the past 10 years it really is inadequate for research purposes in these modern times and to replace it now would probably be between $600MM to $1B due to the increase in construction prices over the past several years so this potentially could save the school money by not having to build something new. And while there is lab space peppered throughout other and somewhat newer buildings on the medical campus, most of that is outdated as well. Having updated lab space can attract and retain researchers to the school as well as the grant money, IP, and patents with it which is important for a research institution. While VCU's Master Plan has several other big projects on deck and purchasing an existing research building would likely save VCU money in the long-term and solve an immediate need, I think they need to focus on a more pressing matter and that's housing, because it's becoming harder and harder for students who can't get into the dorms to find affordable housing near campus...

what the fuck

Making a $275M real estate purchase from a cigarette company is a pretty *interesting* move considering that VCU is already in debt...

Im guessing rao and his cronies will line their pockets with gifts from Altria after buying this building

So I shouldn't apply to Altria?

Omfg so glad I’m graduating before this shitshow gets worse

Didn’t we just lose 83 million?

Here we go..

Just increase enrollment and tuition. Easy peasy.

can’t wait to graduate.. tuition just skyrockets each year with them purchasing any and everything with a roof

That'll be a lot of tax revenue gone.

Soooo Altria is planning to layoff everyone in this building??!

Everyone is already in debt.

It sounds like they want to expand MCV, so probably viewing it as a long-term investment ..MCV is the cash cow for Rao

Rao lost 83M, VCU had it stolen by Rao.

and then they gave him a raise!

Is this area safe?

It’s safe. It’s just not as green as you’d think.

No, very dangerous place

It must be, a former president offered to buy it several years back, and he clearly wouldn't buy a place that is unsafe... ...all though as I understand it, he overvalued the US GDP and undervalued that national debt to get loans from the IMF because of his "celebrity status" appreciation value, and is currently under investigation by the EU for these shady practices with a potential ban from doing business with Europe...

Getting an email from Rao be like

"The vegetarian option is a chicken salad sandwich". I died reading that.
