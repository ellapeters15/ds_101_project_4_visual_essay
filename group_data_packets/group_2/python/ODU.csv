post,Heads up: ODUGlobal is changing ALL online 16 week classes to 8 week starting fall 2026,"Heads up: ODUGlobal is changing ALL online 16 week classes to 8 week starting fall 2026 The official announcement won't be made until spring 2026 starts, but this information is straight from my advisor. For some reason they think everyone would just love a condensed format for ALL classes?? I would be fine if there was a choice between 16 and 8 week, but forcing 8 week classes on everyone just puts a lot more pressure on people for no reason. Good luck trying to do part time classes at a reasonable pace to juggle work and school. Plus, how is this going to affect veteran's benefits that are paid based on how many classes you're enrolled in per MONTH not per semester? If you're only in two 8 week classes instead of four 16 week for full time, that money from the VA will be cut in half. They're planning on testing some pilot 8 week classes in spring 2026. **If you don't want ODU to implement this idiotic change:** * **Contact ODU and voice your comments about why this is a bad idea and how the change will impact you.** You can contact: * The board of visitors ([mkarlis@odu.edu](mailto:mkarlis@odu.edu)) * President Brian Hemphill ([bhemphill@odu.edu](mailto:bhemphill@odu.edu)) * The student government association ([sga@odu.edu](mailto:sga@odu.edu)) * DO NOT SIGN UP FOR THE 8 WEEK ONLINE SPRING CLASSES. Low enrollment = less money and less incentive for them to move forward with the changes. EDIT: Be sure to email the provost and executive vice president for academic affairs, Brian Payne ([bpayne@odu.edu](mailto:bpayne@odu.edu)) as well and let him know how you feel about this effort to ""creat\[e\] opportunities for as many students as possible to discover and develop their unique talents so they can use those talents to make a difference in the world"": [https://www.odu.edu/acadaffairs/article/a-message-the-provost-forward-focused-digital-transformation-initiative](https://www.odu.edu/acadaffairs/article/a-message-the-provost-forward-focused-digital-transformation-initiative) EDIT 2: **President Hemphill is hosting a virtual open forum for ODUGlobal students on Monday, October 6 at 5:30pm EST and Monday, October 20 at 12:00pm EST**.

comment,Heads up: ODUGlobal is changing ALL online 16 week classes to 8 week starting fall 2026,"I’m currently a student in the MS in Cybersecurity program, which I believe falls under the ODUGlobal category, and the AI classes seem to be 8 weeks. They also want to charge a full semester’s worth of tuition for it. This is a money grab that George Mason also does, and they’ve probably recognized it. Truth be told, as a former student at Johns Hopkins (when work was paying for it), ODU needs to do a better job with providing quality education.

comment,Heads up: ODUGlobal is changing ALL online 16 week classes to 8 week starting fall 2026,Personally I used to go to a global university until transferring to ODU on campus. All courses were 8 weeks and while intensive I didn’t notice the difference between that and some online courses here until going in person. I think if this does happen the vast majority of people will be ok. People adapt and tend to be better at it than we give ourselves credit for. I’m curious if this will extend to all online courses though or if this is just unique to the global campus.,2025-10-02 08:09:23,0
comment,Heads up: ODUGlobal is changing ALL online 16 week classes to 8 week starting fall 2026,"Apparently the 8 week classes will at least be asynchronous. Asynchronous is good for those of us who have to schedule class around work, but also surprising because I couldn’t find a single asynchronous class at ODU while getting my Civil Engineering degree.

We're trying to figure out ways to communicate with other students outside the structures of ODU (student email). A major problem is that many students aren't aware of what's going on, and once they are they don't really have avenues for action outside contacting Admin. The faculty have been able to come together because they are using alternative channels, so we're just trying to set that up without implicating any one student as the organizer. Definitely open to suggestions that seem less scammy if you'd like to join us :)",2025-10-08 10:36:46,0

I have 4 AP's this year though, and have all A's and 1 B+'s on my quarterly grades that are updated on my transcript. Extracurriculars are very good. Good diversity and abundance. (Similar to yours in a sense.) I also have a great essay, and two good recommendation letters. I'm going to apply by Dec 1 for Early Action.

post,Online education is overpriced and underwhelming,Online education is overpriced and underwhelming I’m a junior engineering tech major and just found out I’ll only have the option to take two classes in person until I graduate. My senior design class won’t even be in person. We pay an insane amount for each credit already but my greatest concern is that the online classes I’ve been shoved into so far have been prerecorded videos so we can’t ask questions in class and professors who use automatic grading and don’t provide solutions to homework or quizzes even after you email them asking for guidance. I live in person classes. It allows me to make connections and feel involved in my career choice but now I wonder if my classes are entirely online why should I continue attending odu and not a different university. Is anyone else upset about this or am I overreacting?,2024-03-02 09:09:49,58
comment,Online education is overpriced and underwhelming,Have you discussed this with your advisor? Mind if I ask which discipline you're in?

The project is funded by a Filipino American endowment established 27 years ago, reviving cultural programming at ODU. The mural will be completed before Martinez’s public lecture Thursday at the Baron & Ellin Gordon Art Galleries.

You can send a chat from the Library's home page, or you can go to the stairwell and call the Help Desk at 757-683-4178. They do get very busy down at the desk, but they can usually send a security guard up there. Also, staff on the 4th floor typically will tell people that you need to be quiet.",2021-09-17 10:30:57,4

post,Advice from a Senior,"Advice from a Senior ODU is a great school, don't get me wrong. I've loved my 4 years here and I think that since 2015 it has been one of the most exciting times to me a Monarch. But it is not all sunshine and rainbows. ODU does have a lot of things they need to fix, and they don't seem to be getting done. To everyone coming to ODU as a freshman and those who are here now take some advice... it will save you some headaches.: 1. Don't rely on your advisors. I have had over 6 different advisors here for my major (Political Science). They have given me all types of routes to graduation but they were all flawed. Take a few hours once a semester and look at your DegreeWorks, it is simple to plan your schedule. Take the classes that can complete 2 boxes at once, thats is the only way you will get out on time. 2. GO TO CLASS. ODU has a great roster of really interesting professors who's attendance policy is really lax. Its college, go to class. I skipped a lot of class here and have had more stress on my plate on the back end of every semester. If you go to class, you will make dean's list; its that easy. Because classes here are so small, especially when you get into the major specific classes, your teachers will recognize and remember you AND THEY WILL HELP YOU. More so than other colleges. 3. Don't be afraid to drop a class if it isn't for you. Yes, it is a lot of money down the drain. But, if you drop in time you get the money back and save yourself from suffering through a semester of bull-shit. 4. Dont limit yourself to a specific friend group. I went greek my first semester. It was a blessing and a curse. My brothers are friends for life but i never really branched out. I have so many other interests other than Greek Life and I never got to experience them. ODU has every club you can think of, for every interest. This college is big enough to where there is a group of people who share in that interest. 5. If you don't know what you want to do after you leave here, that is 100% ok. I thought I wanted to be a lawyer for two years, I took high level classes for it and went all the way. But, when i was a junior I took a Public Relations class and it spoke to me. When you know, you know. 6. Finally, enjoy yourself. College goes by way faster than high-school. In a blink of an eye its all over, and most of us won't be going to grad school (and if you do, im sure you will be drowning in work and have little time for fun). Make your friends, make your memories. RIDE THE LION.",2019-04-15 22:50:06,43

comment,Does ODU really think it’s a good idea to hold classes in person still with this high of a positive percent? Aight.,"lol you’re stuck on the point that it’s typically mild for individuals who are vaccinated and healthy. You’re ignoring the point that hospitals are overwhelmed and cannot take care of individuals who need the medical help. Also, not everyone is healthy like you may be. Saying that it’s not a huge risk to a certain age group is ignoring the people it is a massive risk too. AND there are people who are vaccinated, seem to be healthy, and still die. Who wants to be that person? Not me. You can also still carry it and infect others who are not vaccinated. Do you want to carry that on your back that you spread it to a young child or a grandparent and killed them? I know I don’t. There’s alternatives and ways to avoid these situations and we, as a society, are not taking proper precautions because we’re expected to “live with it” like we have with every other illness but omicron is literally the fastest spreading virus known to humans. Why are we going to pretend we can still function normally as a society with this?",2022-01-11 12:12:19,3

post,"Old Dominion University Parking is a borderline criminal organization, and it is crazy they get away with it.","Old Dominion University Parking is a borderline criminal organization, and it is crazy they get away with it. The title says it all got a ticket and I am pissed. I know what you are thinking to *""be more responsible or appeal it""*. It does not matter, it is still outrageous. I am a Norfolk taxpayer and student so I am getting double shafted already on this \*\*public school's\*\* funding. What is even crazier is being a Norfolk resident I went ahead and checked and sure enough, they are charging higher than the city in which the university resides!!! *Just get a pass, its a university, of course, they upcharge...* Well, good news I did the leg work for you and checked! ODU citations fees are so damn outlandish they are higher than: Virginia Tech, William&Mary, UVA, University of Richmond...VCU (let's be honest all better institutions). I was surprised too; stopped looking when schools in the city capital were more reasonable with their fees. On top of that, they work meter fees so any full-time student gets strong-armed into paying for the privilege of Overpaying for parking because the parking pass they couldn't afford pays for itself in small lump sums, AND DONT GET ME STARTED ON CC SERVICING FEES IF YOU PAY THE FINES ONLINE. End of the day they are getting away with highway robbery by charging above and beyond damages lost on parking spaces in half-empty parking lots, only used by ~~students~~ **THE PEOPLE ALREADY PAYING TO BE THERE** and faculty. **ODU is in Norfolk charge like it!**",2020-02-24 17:35:44,38

Technically as a graduate research assistant I'm a school employee, but parking isn't any cheaper. What's also fucked, the parking garage on 43rd and elkhorn is metered, but it's free to park there on the weekends. But it accepts money if you pay to park on the weekends / after 10pm on weekdays. I always see people paying and tell them ""hey, you don't actually have to pay right now"". I park off campus on weekdays, I'm sorry, but I don't want to share my secrets on reddit. But it's only like a 10 minute walk from my car, and I usually skate to save more time if it's dry out. I'm sure you can find somewhere similar to park. That being said, I know you're upset, but it is your fault that you got a ticket. Be more careful when you park, don't park anywhere that you know you will get a ticket (really look out for signage). I know I got an email saying that you at one point during the year they do something where you can trade in a jar of peanut butter and they'll forgive your ticket. The peanut butter goes to a food bank. Idk, might be worth finding out when they do that and not paying your ticket and save some money by donating peanut butter.",2020-02-24 19:12:57,16

comment,ODU's alert system,"ODU PD doesn't run the alert system alone btw.

A police response should immediately trigger any sort of lockdown especially in potentially life threatening situations. If a shooting happens, 20 minutes can be devastating. If they can take the time to listen to my phone call and ask for my personal information they can easily send out an alert that's maybe a sentence long to warn people to stay safe indoors.",2025-02-27 22:44:46,6

comment,Nusbaum Apartment Photos,"1. it’s relatively quiet. the walls are paper thin so you will hear your neighbors a lot. i lived on the 2nd floor and could hear my downstairs neighbor and my neighbor across the hall do basically everything. i was fortunate to never have anything drastically annoying or bothersome to the point i couldn’t enjoy the space. 2. i felt safe for the most part. it’s right off killam so that’s always an issue and the local neighborhood surrounds the building so you get a lot more locals, which can be hit or miss. buildings b and c have an exterior door that is an extra layer of security. no one can get inside the building without a key to that door and because it’s only a few tenants, no one is just letting people inside the same way they would for other dorms 3. it’s an older building so you get a lot of older building issues ( i had a sewage pipe burst in my shower 🫠 ) i ran into problems of roaches my second year living there as did my friend who lived on the first floor. never infestation level, but still didn’t like having them especially because i was a relatively clean person. personal issues i had were the small kitchen and i despised the laundry room. there’s 3 washers and 3 dryers and rarely do all of the machines work. i also felt like the custodian staff forget about the buildings, especially the laundry room, as it was never cleaned.",2025-08-12 13:45:39,9

post,Brain tumor and school,"Brain tumor and school Hello, everyone. I wanted to post this just to hopefully get some encouragement. So, roughly a year ago I went to the hospital and asked for a MRI and they found a brain tumer, I had it removed and then got a shunt valve installed, while I went, I was enrolled in classes and I'm a senior, I was also in ROTC so before the surgery, I emailed the school and they converted all my grades for that semester to I's, so what I did the next semester was talk to the professors to then sit in on their classes and make up my work, I did this and just completed this semester I passed all my classes. I wanted to ask encouragement from any engineers or students to keep going, because I get more brain fog and problems because of it, and before engineering is hard, but now I have this. More info: It was totaling 13 brain surgeries, and basically, I have dementia now and have really bad short-term memory, but my long-term memory remains unaffected.

post,What I would do if I got a chance to start my college all over again. A little advice for a change.,"What I would do if I got a chance to start my college all over again. A little advice for a change. 1. Do research on related job market and figure out what specific job position you want to do after graduating as detail as possible and as soon as possible to plan your courses accordingly. (put thoughts in optional classes accordingly) 2. Do research on [Ratemyprofessor.com](https://ratemyprofessor.com/) for your upcoming semester courses, come up with a good plan for registration and register as soon as you know your ticket. Be smart about time in between courses because that's the time you can actually do your homework effectively since you can discuss with your friends or get contact with professors if needed since they all are active during the day. Don't forget to meet your advisors with your semester-courses-plan or you will get a hold and can't register on time. 3. Try to get involve in many projects, many field-related associations as much as possible because these will be the closest thing to work experience if you can't get any internship (knock on wood). Also, figure out when is the earliest you can apply for internship and plan on applying ahead of time. This will be a big element on your resume. Start practicing building your resume, this activity will help you shape up what you want and what you need for your future. (I regretted so much for not doing all these sooner) 4. Make friends in classes, offer helps when you can and you will get help when you need. That's how most people survive college, team work makes dream work. They can also possibly be your future connections or just simply friends that can chill with you. 5. Expensive lesson that I had to pay: it is much faster and way more effective to do everything in the right way than spending time trying to find loopholes to go around it. You can be creative on how to approach problems once you learn how to do thing right. 6. Try to plan everything out as detail as you can and try to stick with the plan as much as possible since your time of a day will be very limited. Use the time wisely! 7. All of things above are essential but don't forget to make friends, enjoy yourself with hobbies, parties and such. These few years will pass very quickly so just make this best out of it. I am sorry for the long input. I did a lot of thought of this after I graduated with lots of regrets and wished I've known and done all of this before. Luckily I meet good friends to help me through college academically and mentally that I could never thank them enough. I wish you very best in your college journey! It seems overwhelming but it is actually very much manageable. You got this! Happy Friday everybody.",2022-07-22 10:14:38,30

comment,I'm about to drop out,"Which masters program? That’s kinda the nature of the grad programs at ODU. There isn’t much course flexibility because the student population is significantly smaller than undergrad programs. If you don’t have a specific goal or job in mind, then I wouldn’t waste your time or money. But if you have a specific intention, then you’ll figure it out. An extra semester or two won’t hurt you in the long run..",2025-01-08 14:56:04,2

But I took summer classes and my advisor was virtually no help. And the best part is I have to come back next fall for 2 classes because I can’t take those classes over the summer to finish and they only offer them once a year but the the other classes I was taking conflict in schedule last semester and they are once a year classes also. My advisor really sucked big time poor advice the whole way through. Plus some of the staff retired and I had to take the final class before they changed my concentration.

Add --course/--term filters, a --dry-run, and a clean course/term/file folder scheme. For testing, I’ve used Postman and Insomnia; DreamFactory helped me spin up a quick REST API to log file metadata in SQLite for dedupe and sync.

comment,We've all been there,"The widespread use of ChatGPT is the reason why people graduating with degrees from now on are absolutely useless. The machine is doing the learning, not the students.

comment,We've all been there,"That’s entirely based on the individual. What you’re implying is that a person who uses ChatGPT automatically falls into that demographic, right? ChatGPT is simply a tool that requires user input. A person can use ChatGPT and still be proficient in critical thinking, communication, reading, and writing on their own. I could make a similar generalization about someone fresh out of college entering the workforce someone who is book smart but lacks work ethic, soft skills, and the experience needed to perform the job effectively because they rely solely on their academic knowledge without any real-life experience.",2025-01-09 19:54:42,1

So, yesterday, some people came dressed up as Big Bird, big yellow bird from Sesame Street, and birdwatchers, binoculars and all as a form of friendly protest. Thanks to that, parents were informed and the problem became more out there and some people have actually called the health department. Now, we're just waiting and hoping for results.

post,PSA: do not live in university villages,"PSA: do not live in university villages I don’t know if I’m just incredibly unlucky, but I felt like I need to make this so others don’t have to go through the same thing I’ve gone through. University villages is a genuine hellhole. Since moving in, not a single appliance except the microwave and fridge has gone without breaking. The sink leaks creating a pool at my feet whenever I brush my teeth, the ceiling fan doesn’t work and clicks and wobbles when it does, Ethernet ports aren’t even connected to anything, etc. Sometimes the vents spew a disgusting smell that smells like acetone. My girlfriend usually smells it in the hallways when she comes in becuase I’m nose blind to it. Once, I was the unlucky bastard that had the smell come into his room but it was so thick I was genuinely scared for my health. I called my RA more than 15 times, no answer. I called maintenance over 15 times, no answer. I was so worried I called a non emergency police line and when the cop came, guess who finally answered. (They put the wrong number for the RA, I don’t blame them. I blame maintenance) What made me write this is that in the middle of me cooking dinner my STOVE randomly stopped working. My stove, which has been repaired at least twice this school year by maintenance, stopped working AGAIN. I’m so defeated. Luckily I just air fried my dinner and it tastes ok, but woudl taste much better if I was able to actually cook it. I’m so done with nothing working and everything breaking. Please don’t waste your money on this place, they clearly cut corners everywhere they could. I shouldn’t have to call maintenance every week, nor should I have to deal with everything breaking.",2022-03-01 22:00:02,25

comment,Backing into parking spots,yeah it's so annoying when someone holds up the whole lane trying to back in perfectly. the reason odu doesn't want you to back in though is because they use cameras to scan license plates for the parking permits. since most cars in virginia only have a plate on the back if you're backed in their little car can't see it when they drive by to scan everyone. it's all about making it easier for them to hand out tickets lol. honestly sometimes it's easier to just find a cheap driveway to park in around norfolk on prked than deal with the campus garages.,2025-10-10 02:16:54,2

comment,"Since “it may be the end of the line for ODU's maglev structure”, can you make the part over Hampton Blvd. a bridge/walkway for students as an alternate route for crossing the Blvd?",The April special election questions includes protection of the monorail. Hemphill is for keeping the portion over Hampton Blvd. A pedestrian bridge would require federal money which are typically spent as “road improvements.” So part of the negotiations would require the removal of certain crosswalks and stop lights. Which is why it was ruled out in discussions. If you want to improve the situation on Hampton Blvd I would recommend joining the Transportation Board in SGA. We negotiated with the city to get leading pedestrian intervals on the crosswalks and a study on no turn on red on a specifically dangerous intersection.,2023-03-26 23:42:34,1

comment,Virtual Meeting on 8 week online,"Faculty here. It’s true that there has been a push during his tenure to create more 8-week courses, as well as programs that would consist of entirely accelerated course offerings. I developed one this past year, and our department has 10 courses that are taught in both 8- and 16-week formats. However, it was only decided this summer that every course would move to this format for next fall. So to suggest we’ve been “working on this” for four years would be a significant misrepresentation of reality, even for a department that HAS been working on this. This is to say nothing of the departments who have done no development in this area.",2025-10-06 20:47:11,10

comment,How do yall do it?,"Idk. It’s perspective. I use music to block out other ambient noises. If you are looking to enhance your learning experience try wordless music, instrumentals, mozart, or jazz. Play the volume low since You should already be studying in a quiet area. The volume should be low enough so your music does not interrupt your thoughts. Your mind will intrinsically pick up the tones. Graduate to music with words but you will learn certain genres are better than others. Music has a way of affecting you emotions which can be a distraction if your sensitive to that kind of input so be mindful. It should make studying a tad bit more fun but nothing more.",2025-04-13 08:21:11,5

post,Is it dangerous on ODU’s campus?,"Is it dangerous on ODU’s campus? My kid is a senior in high school. We’re doing a last minute scramble for colleges right now. She has a lot of acceptances, but financial aid packages aren’t quite what we were expecting. ODU seems to check a lot of boxes of what she is looking for, although it’s not a school that we’re really familiar with. As soon as I mentioned the school, she went onto TikTok. (I guess that’s your generation’s research tool.) She’s now leery about the school because people were talking about gunshots. Is campus safe? Give me the pros and cons of going to school there.",2025-02-08 21:29:53,23
comment,Is it dangerous on ODU’s campus?,Main campus is generally safe she be fine just don’t walk around at night alone.

comment,Is it dangerous on ODU’s campus?,It has improved as the campus has expanded. I went to school there in the late 90s and early 2000s and am a local. The suggestions of the other posters is accurate though. Be aware of your surroundings and don't be walking late at night off campus alone. It's not the boogeyman people make it out to be though.,2025-02-08 21:57:15,17
comment,Is it dangerous on ODU’s campus?,"I, a thin white-passing girl, use to walk around the campus at 1am all the time when I went there. There are student security guards who's job it is to roam the campus and keep an eye out for suspicious activity. If you were anxious about walking alone at night, you could actually request an escort, and the student security would send someone to walk you to your dorm. Idk if they still have it but they also had a shuttle service you could request to drive you to certain parts of the campus at night too. I always felt safe despite people warning me other wise. Not saying there is zero crime but I feel like some people over play the amount of crime that happens on campus.",2025-02-08 23:57:19,13
comment,Is it dangerous on ODU’s campus?,"What I’m about to say can all be taken with a grain of salt. I’m a commuter student so I drive everyday to get to classes and then stay for the entire day until I decide it’s time to head back home across the HRBT. TL;DR: I have no safety complaints for ODU campus, in regards of safety it’s absolutely fine. However, I can’t say the same for Norfolk. Pros -Good tuition prices (compared to our sister schools in the area) we have fairly low credit hour pricing and our resident halls I would like to say are on the lower end. -Vibrant campus community, if there’s something of interest there’s surely someone/some group who shares an interest. -Diverse community, we have hundreds of people from different walks of life here, I’m sure your daughter would fit in. -Safety, the main campus area is safe in all intensive purposes, we have our proper police department, cameras and surveillance equipment everywhere to keep an eye out, well lit areas at night for visibility, and we have accreditations for our police department. I assume your daughter is smart enough to be aware of where she’s going and all. Cons -The city of Norfolk itself. While campus is fine and all and there’s no complaints about safety apart from the occasional alert and what now, the city itself isn’t known to be the best in safety, it obviously has its areas you want to avoid but I know your daughter is smart enough, so long as she stays in populated areas and around campus I’m sure she’ll be just fine. -Parking, I have my own complaints about parking and it could definitely get some improvements, there aren’t many areas to park for commuters, faculty, and residents. -Traffic, the traffic on Hampton Blvd will 100% get noisy, congested, and horrendous at times of the day, so whether she decides to commute or reside on campus that could be a consideration. -Staff, I recommend using rate my profesor for this one but there are going to be a handful of garbage tier professors that will suck but by using RMP you can easily avoid them and it will make life easier. I apologize if I may have sound crude or blunt in the test above, but if you would like to know more I HIGHLY encourage you to ask around more and get more opinions and information from other students, especially from those who live on and around the campus. Best of luck to you and your daughter! Go Monarchs!",2025-02-08 23:03:51,18
comment,Is it dangerous on ODU’s campus?,"I think a lot of ODU's reputation for being dangerous or ghetto comes from racism/classism tbh. It's definitely a PWI but it's a lot more diverse and accessible than say tech or UVA. It's also more of a ""weed"" campus than an ""alcohol"" campus (I mean, weed is still illegal here but that doesn't stop anyone who wants to partake) if that makes sense. I don't think that makes it unsafe, but it does give it a reputation for being trashier because alcohol in college is more socially acceptable. I've never had any issues with safety (they exist, but just personally Ive been fine). ODU PD, the WGEC, and Housing and Residence life are pretty proactive about safety and clery act reporting and Title IX compliance, and there's tons of programs like Safe Ride and safety escorts. If you go looking for trouble you can find it, but it's generally a lovely campus. Other factors- Affordability is great; I get tons of scholarships through the school (I mean, I get good grades and demonstrate financial need, but they exist if you put the work in to earn them). Housing- No communal baths in any of the dorms, which is nice. And there's only single and double rooms- no triples anymore. Some of the Halls are great- some are less great. But honestly, as far as dorm rooms go, they're all livable. Housing is only guaranteed to freshman though so keep that in mind. Faculty- I've had great experiences, but it really does vary by department. We don't have a whole lot of illustrious world-renowned professors, but I tend to prefer a professor who actually likes to teach and interact with students in addition to research and publishing so I don't think it's a bad thing necessarily Misc: • Food is decent but not much variety and not tons of healthy options. Food is contracted out through a company called Aramark and it can be hit or miss. • I find health services to be a bit lacking; It's fine if you need a strep test, but it couldnt substitute a primary care physician (not that it needs to- just something to consider). There's no pharmacy on campus and the CVS near campus is kind of a headache to deal with. Counseling services are pretty good though and there's no limit to the number of appointments per semester. There's also free personal training and a campus dietician. • Parking is a nightmare. ODU used to be a commuter school, and then they built dorms where parking lots used to be and now there's no parking. And most of the things to do off-campus in Norfolk (zoo, downtown, and waterfront, that kinda thing) are not walkable or easily accessed through public transportation",2025-02-09 02:01:00,7

comment,Is it dangerous on ODU’s campus?,"ODU’s campus is like a bubble of safety/cleanliness that exists smack dab in the middle of the ghetto. Whenever a violent crime happens on campus they send out a mass notification through school email. In the two years I was there I only received two notifications, one was a mugging, one was a sexual assault, both occurred at 2am while the victim was walking alone. In terms of campus life and the educational experience, it’s a good university. There is a higher percentage of women than men at the university and they all seem to be thriving and having fun, making connections, joining groups and things like that. It really is a standard university and college experience, it just suffers from its location a bit. The last criticism I have is that it’s kind of located in a food desert. If your daughter doesn’t have a car to travel to different restaurants or to a grocery store, she’ll have no choice but to eat the same 5 or 6 fast food options that are available on campus everyday, for every meal (Chick-Fil-A, Qdoba, Subway, Panda Express, a burger place, and a pizza place.

comment,Is it dangerous on ODU’s campus?,"Agreed on all points I was a commuter living in vb and then my senior year I moved to norfolk (off campus about a 7min drive away) I took night classes walked around at 10-11pm on campus and to the parking areas and never felt unsafe. I had friends that lived on campus (just across the street) that I would frequently visit as well, and it was never a fear for my safety. The weed, though omlllll they smoke up the apartments across the street. However, I worked downtown sometimes getting off at 12-1am - I would not walk around alone at night. Even the neighborhood I moved to If i did not need to be outside, im not really outside. I never had a problem walking home alone from a bar or something around the block, but I wouldn't recommend someone unfamiliar to the area to do so. There were gunshots near my apartment a couple of times, which wasn't great. Downtown was a decent amount of homeless or drunk people hanging around or in front of the norva (concert venue) after shows. I chalk that up to the difference between students and locals the level of safety. In general, the area surrounding ODU I felt pretty safe in, and if she is to leave campus at night, be aware and make good choices. Norfolk is a lot of fun. I still preferred it over virginia beach when it came to going out. The campus has a good culture its really diverse, theres lots of places to meet people and form friendships off campus if she pleases, the proffesors generally are great and the counselors in my experience were very helpful in making sure I was on track or helping me navigate switching majors. The students are cool, and theres lots of club activities to participate in. Bonus price wise doesn't break the bank, especially if you're in state. I recommend it. I was a commuter & a local I made a ton of friends over the years and most ended up being through groups I found off campus, though the on campus clubs I joined & sat in helped me make a good smaller group of friends as well. -Edit: I never had too much trouble finding places to park in a garage unless I chose to try to find one that was campus side. Parking on 43rd by the mcdonalds was usually my best bet, even during 8ams. Hampton blvd though during peak hours is aweful definitely leave early. Also, parking pass prices for commuters creeping up every year feels like a robbery. Make sure your pass is up to date parking tickets, I think, were $50 per violation.

post,Did any of your teachers accuse you of using AI?,"Did any of your teachers accuse you of using AI? My professor in my history class is saying that I use AI according to Turnitin. They want me to either fail the class or have it taken up by Office of Student Conduct and Academic Integrity where I will have a hearing. I didn’t use it so I have no idea how they could say I did. They basically are trying to have me prove a negative. What do you think I should do? These are the options given to me. Option A: Voluntary Resolution (Incident resolved between faculty and student) The faculty communicated with the student, explains the alleged violation, and proposes sanctions. The student acknowledges the violation. The student accepts the proposed sanctions. The faculty and the student sign the Academic Integrity Violation Report Form. Form and referral materials forwarded to OSCAI. Option B: Hearing (Incident Referred directly to OSCAI and a hearing takes place) Appropriate in the following situations: The severity of the alleged violation warrants a response greater than a grade sanction. The student denies the allegation(s). The student does not agree to faculty-proposed sanctions.",2023-12-19 07:59:08,23
comment,Did any of your teachers accuse you of using AI?,I would say fight it if you didn't use any AI to write the paper. here is an example from Vanderbilt on why they aren't using Turnitin's AI detection feature https://www.vanderbilt.edu/brightspace/2023/08/16/guidance-on-ai-detection-and-why-were-disabling-turnitins-ai-detector/ so I would do some research on more articles to help build your case on why the feature has flaws,2023-12-19 09:23:33,33

comment,Did any of your teachers accuse you of using AI?,"I instructed graduate students in biochemistry on how to use AI in a protein-folding assignment.

The hearing will be your opportunity to present whatever evidence you have that you didn’t do anything wrong. ODU professors have had training available on AI and the limits of AI detection in Turnitin, so they shouldn’t be relying on it to begin with. They have also had training available for designing coursework more effectively for the age of generative AI. Your professor should know better on both counts. If you really didn’t use AI, then I can only assume this is happening to you because of your prof being lazy in both grading and continuing education. Good luck.",2023-12-20 08:16:25,5

comment,Did any of your teachers accuse you of using AI?,That’s why I am so upset cause I didn’t use AI and it’s saying that I did.

comment,Did any of your teachers accuse you of using AI?,I did and it’s says about 23% was AI assist. When the teacher showed theirs it says 60%.

comment,Did any of your teachers accuse you of using AI?,Ok thank you that is a good idea. I just don’t know if the teacher will even look at evidence at this point.

comment,Did any of your teachers accuse you of using AI?,Makes sense but you knew they would have to use AI to get the answers that they needed.

comment,Did any of your teachers accuse you of using AI?,Seems like the professor had a change a heart and realize what they did was wrong. Did option A. Did all the paper work and sign it.

comment,Did any of your teachers accuse you of using AI?,Run it again to repeat the experiment. If you can prove the percentage of AI assist is not constant then that hopefully should reduce the veracity of their score/case. Does it show you the similar articles?

comment,Did any of your teachers accuse you of using AI?,Exactly I what get it if I didn’t cite something correctly or someone other reason but from what I am seeing there is no reason that Turnitin is correct or has any prove of anything. Thats why is the most upsetting cause you can really prove a negative. We are supposed to be innocent till proven guilty and this doesn’t feel that way.,2023-12-19 11:07:08,3
comment,Did any of your teachers accuse you of using AI?,Smart idea I will run it though again and see if it changes the score. No it just highlighted what it saw as AI generated/assisted writing. The first thing was the ODU honor code which I thought was strange but I guess ODU could have made a new one using AI. Then mostly my citations that I made sure to properly cite. There is no info on how they get the idea that you use AI just that it does and I have to believe it.,2023-12-19 10:44:45,4
comment,Did any of your teachers accuse you of using AI?,"Run a few of the prof's publications through it while you're at at.

comment,Did any of your teachers accuse you of using AI?,"Report your findings to the administration. If your Turnitin is only pinging the honor code and citations, then your professor’s assertion that the body of your paper is AI generated is unfounded and false. Also, bring up that there is absolutely no transparency on how Turnitin determines whether something is AI generated or not. Being a higher level education institution, ODU should not just take Turnitin’s lack of response as an accurate tool to determine plagiarism, especially when a paying student’s academic is at stake. If they give you issue, I’d go as far as the president’s office. They can’t accuse you of plagiarism with such a baseless claim.",2023-12-19 11:19:56,6

So my girl is applying to transfer to ODU this year and has been talking about it nonstop for weeks. She’s been wanting this for as long as she’s known the school and mentions it anytime we’re together. I’m totally cool with that and have supported her through it all. She definitely has the stats to get in so I’m proud of her, but its an insane obsession now. She’s visited the school about 6 times and says how much she loves everything about the school and I mean EVERYTHING. The Grounds, programs, people, architecture, history, traditions, colors, mascot, shape, *smell*? She even told me I would look hotter if I dressed more like Taylor Heinicke? What do you guys think that means?? She literally knows everything about the school and does ODU trivia with me when we’re bored or asks me to help her write emails to professors she thinks she’ll have next year to tell them how much she “loves” their work. Last night we were doing it in bed, and everything was going smoothly. While she talked me through it I thought I heard her mumbling but couldn’t really make out what she was saying. But at the end she screamed “Monarchs!” and was talking to “her little Taylor Heinicke.” She said she wanted to be at his school so bad and would do anything for it. Instead of my name! She said Monarchs! I asked her about it after and she told me it didn’t mean anything and just kept rambling about how much she really wants the school.

Please let me know if there is anything that I should change or what features I should add.

Idk, while I 100% believed there’s solid merit to a lot of what he says, his personality is not that of one that adheres to a teacher’s disposition showcasing their desire to disperse knowledge, so if he got sacked over being “too much” or whatever, I can’t say I’m too shocked. He really didn’t /teach/ me anything. I see he still puts a lot of emphasis on mis/disinformation, that was the bulk of his “teaching”, just warnings about the internet being a cesspool and how to navigate that successfully-ish. What’s new lol. Apart from that, his course was literally nothing but recorded rants having zero to do with lessons, not that there were any, and he assigned fairly easy papers in terms of theme, citation and source formatting. The first assignments didn’t pop up until sometime in October if I recall correctly. Easy A. Don’t be fooled though, if that syllabus pull really is his words, he’s right and we’re mostly fucked because the job market in America -is- going to inevitably change for humans due to ai advancement. I’m working towards more than a degree, you should be too. Look around for a minute and you’ll see the college degree just doesn’t hold up like it used to.

Boy, am I glad I did. They responded quickly, got me to the right person, and we got the ball rolling. Apparently, even though the portal said everything was turned it, something was wrong with my transcripts and my application couldn’t be processed.

Checking in is probably a good thing, since a few folks in charge are pretty new in their positions. That was actually the case with me quite a few times throughout the program. A class I completed showed as incomplete in DegreeWorks months after I finished it, my portfolio reviewer didn't grade my portfolio because I (gen librarianship) was assigned to the school library reviewer, I got docked points on a paper for submitting late even though I submitted about 2 weeks early... It's a great program but I did need to check in a few times. Unofficial transcripts were fine when I applied, and they sent an email after I was tentatively accepted with instructions on sending official transcripts. Lindy Brown was extraordinarily helpful along the way, and I reached out to her multiple times throughout the program just to make sure I was on track. I generally found the program to be extremely relaxed on due dates (ie: the deadline for fall admission was March 1 and I applied May 17) so I'm sure after you deal with these application hoops (and maybe send one more ""circling back"" email, lol) you'll be in and well on your way to the degree :)",2024-12-05 12:27:53,1

post,Was falsely reported using AI on a paper in a class,"Was falsely reported using AI on a paper in a class I recently had a professor tell me my essay I submitted appeared to have a significant amount of content generated by AI technology, which counts as cheating. So the professor said she was obligated to report it. I 100% did not use any AI, so I don’t know if this is a situation where the detector is just wrong or what, but I seriously do not know what to do and I am so stressed out. I don’t want to be in trouble for something I didn’t do and I don’t know how to properly defend my case. I read online that AI detection is extremely finicky and new and that it can falsely identify AI usage in papers, I just didn’t expect this to happen to me. Anyone have advice?",2023-04-29 02:33:11,20
comment,Was falsely reported using AI on a paper in a class,"Some random advice from an alum: Don't panic. This is going to be a pain in the ass and nobody needs this kind of pain in the ass this late in the semester, but here we are. Between you and the prof, only one of you knows for sure whether or not you used AI on your paper. Hint: it isn't the prof. The prof used a tool with an unknown probability of getting it right. Odds are very good they didn't develop it themselves, don't understand how it works and are operating based on marketing claims from TurnItIn or some service like that. Every bit of your defense in this needs to be directed at making the prof prove how reliable the tool is and chipping away the university's confidence in it. If the prof decided this without machine assistance, they need to be made to detail their methods and provide an analysis of how they reached that conclusion. Consider dropping the computer science department a line and asking if one of the faculty would be willing to be an advocate for you. There will likely be someone there who's studied this stuff and can help drive the uncertainty point home. Having someone on the faculty in your corner will lend some additional gravitas to your arguments. Good luck, and let us know how this turns out. If you're the first to have been wrongly accused of this, the process may take awhile. If you prevail, it may set a precedent.",2023-04-29 07:48:32,16
comment,Was falsely reported using AI on a paper in a class,"False positive rates are a real thing. The AI detection software claims to get it right most of the time, but this is hard to confirm. Most human generated text has significant numbers of errors (grammer, spelling, punctuation) and is therefore very easy to classify. How the companies get their published rates is not clear. As writing gets better (fewer errors), includes a more common vocabulary distribution, or includes more commonly quoted phrases the possibility of false positives goes up. The false positive rate on well written, human-generated text has not been reported, as far as I have seen. In other subreddits many professional writers have said the classifiers flag their writing as likely AI-generated. If your paper was written on google docs, you should be able to access the activity log and show that to your professor. Human written text verse cut-paste-revise text will have very different activity profiles. If you used Word or another program, then I think you have to manually turn activity tracking on, which most people don't. If you don't have an activity log for the assignment, the best you can do is explain to your professor what you did, and if you have other samples of your writing, provide those for comparison. Be direct and don't lie.

comment,tonight’s the night😈😈😈😈,"No you got it right if your funds disbursed and you aren't selected for verification this year then it should just be the process of them sending your refund out. We did have a decent number of students where their funds disbursed, then we were notified right afterwards that they actually were selected for verification. School then has to hold the funds until the verification review is complete, mainly because if students don't provide whatever is requested for verification (it can be tax documents, documents confirming identity, or both) then the DOE will order the full disbursement returned to them. If school cost $3,000, and the disbursement was $5,000, then the leftover $2,000 would be refunded to the student. If the school released the refund to a student before they complete verification, and then the student never provides the documents, the school is required to send the full amount back, all $5,000. But the school already sent the student a refund so they have to send the $3,000 used for classes back, and then $2,000 out of the schools pocket since they cant reverse the refund. Now the school has to find a way to get the full $5,000 balance back from the student since the classes taken are no longer paid for and the refund amount had to be paid back by the school to DOE. Student cant use financial aid if verification wasn't completed so it turns into a collections scenario which sucks for everyone. End result is that its easier to hold the whole disbursement, then release the refund once the verification process is completed. Tons of students were selected for verification last minute and financial aid departments at schools across the country are struggling to keep up with the sudden doubling of their workload. If your account looks stuck I would just confirm with them that you don't need to do verification. If not then the department is just moving slow likely due to all the students that are. The Department of Education will not tell you of you are selected for verification, they only tell the schools who receive your FAFSA since its viewed as the schools responsibility to handle the process.",2025-08-21 12:50:26,1

It has never been a call for the murder of all israelis. Thats just something israelis say to americans to justify the genocide of Palestinians. Palestinians are the group that’s indigenous to that area. They wish to be free in the entirety of their home land (from river to sea) and not confined to two small sections of their country.

It draws us together and makes us unite as a people. And for those confused as to what the phrase ""From the River to the Sea"" means, It's a call for the destruction of the state and people of Israel. You know, a literal genocide.

Israeli far right wing often wishes to expand. Meanwhile many Palestinian groups (Hamas and Hezbollah as an example) wish death on Israel. 3) you got the wrong state. The Jews and Palestinians were fighting before 1948. It mostly started at the British mandate when Jews started to buy land in the area.

No one said anything about god's chosen people. But thanks for bringing age-old antisemitic points into the conversation, that reveals a lot about your views. When Hamas terrorists invaded Israel and slaughtered innocent civilians, they didn't target the ultra-religious orthodox Jews who believe in the ""chosen people"" idea. Their victims were anyone who breathed. Peace loving people, activists who believed in peace between Palestinians and Jews, secular people, families, foreigners, Thai workers, tourists, and a significant amount of Arabs as well. Really trying to understand your wallet analogy and how it possibly fits into the conversation. I fail to see how its relevant at all. >If you happen to be Jewish and I'm Muslim, then is it because you're Jewish that I punched you? Does that mean you're free to kill me? If you know anything about Hamas, you'd understand their legal founding charter calls for literal genocide. Not against evil Zionists, but against Jews. Jews anywhere they may be. It is precisely because we are Jews, and only because we are Jews, that they want to kill us. This isn't exactly news. So yes, the state of Israel has not only the right, but the obligation and duty to protect innocent people against genocidal jihadists. Would your country do any differently? You toss around terms like ""genocide"" while ignoring the actual calls for genocide against Jews. Now, please enlighten us all, what's your solution? Should Israel cease to exist? What should happen to the millions of people who live there? Maybe the Arab countries who persecuted them and kicked them out will take them all back? Maybe the Austrians, Poles, and Germans who forced the Ashkenazim out of their homes and into camps will give them their houses back? Does Hamas have immunity because they hide in urban areas? Do you think the Nazis should of had immunity because they hid in Dresden? Was the allies activity there a genocide, since German civilians died?

comment,ODU reputation,"Firstly, they're both regional state schools, so the reputation will extend not much further than Virginia. VCU, JMU, ODU, GMU all kinda fit in this same category in my opinion. William and Mary is a public ""Ivy"" and therefore has more clout and UVA and Virgina Tech are Tier 1 universities that have clout that extends outside of the region. If I were comparing the regional U's together I'd say the three main things to consider are: 1) What kind of environment do you want to be in --i.e. what type of location is the campus in? 2) What do you want to study? 3) (somewhat related to 1), what types of activities do you want to get involved in during your free time? The good thing is so long as you do well in one of these (or in a regional community college) you can pretty much guarantee a transfer acceptance to any of the others. So, if you're not sure what to do, pick the school with the least cost (to both time and money--e.g. if your family lives in VB, going to ODU is a lot cheaper than moving to Richmond or Fairfax and commuting back for holidays, etc.) Some comparisons based on those three points: 1) VCU is in a more ""downtown"" environment than ODU. 2) ODU has a great (up and coming) Cybersecurity program or Counseling program for grad school (to give a few examples) and the arts programs at VCU are really good. 3) ODU gives you access to a beach environment; VCU is closer to DC and is more centrally located to mountain trails. Academically, you should expect similar rigor between each of the regional state schools and, again, outside of VA none of the regional states carry much weight. And for something general like Communications, I'd say it really doesn't matter. One thing to consider about ODU is its connection to the military and defense sector. If that's something you'd be interested in, ODU is the clear choice.",2022-04-24 16:48:22,20

post,ODU’s COVID-19 cases triple in less than 2 weeks,"ODU’s COVID-19 cases triple in less than 2 weeks NORFOLK, Va. (WAVY) — Old Dominion University is reporting 51 cases of COVID-19 as of Monday morning. The latest updates come from ODU’s COVID-19 testing dashboard. This is up from only 16 cases reported on Sept. 2. Overall, the university has conducted a total of 1,683 tests since the start of fall semester. It is a multi-layered approach to COVID-19 testing, which consists of in-house testing for symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. \-------------------------------------------- [https://www.wavy.com/news/health/coronavirus/odus-covid-19-cases-triple-in-less-than-2-weeks/](https://www.wavy.com/news/health/coronavirus/odus-covid-19-cases-triple-in-less-than-2-weeks/) Any comments on this story and predictions?",2020-09-15 01:37:42,18
comment,ODU’s COVID-19 cases triple in less than 2 weeks,"I believe that number is going to rise rather drastically. It is very likely that people who were positive and either asymptomatic or symptomatic and just didn't care have been in and out of high-traffic buildings. Students are still getting together for group work and not following social distancing protocols (sitting close to each other and removing masks). I hope we can get it under control, but I have already seen how hard people are resisting even the most basic request to keep your mouth and nose covered in buildings, so I imagine we will eventually go the way of many other universities and end up having to revert back to online-only.",2020-09-15 10:32:41,10

comment,2.3 gpa senior I have a dream,"U kno I had straight Z’s and 1 B at TCC and the lowest gpa because I never did any of my work and played around. Lost my financial aid and years later saw a TikTok about southern New Hampshire university, stayed there for 2 years it was all online. Never had test or exams at the university just had to write papers but only took 2 classes a semester, got straight A’s and B’s. Anyways applied to ODU and got in. I think you can do it, like u should apply to ODU or VCU straight to see if u will get in and also apply to tcc as well just as a precaution. I had a GED never made it to the end of high school.",2025-10-13 07:53:39,1

comment,2.3 gpa senior I have a dream,"Applications get bounced if they don't contain all the ""required"" pieces, that is what I meant. The ""optionals"" are truly optional. The effort comment was simply meant to reflect the reality of college work. Many students who come into ODU with high school GPAs under 3.0 struggle because they lack some critical skills, which could be some knowledge from classes (math and writing most frequently), but more commonly they struggle with skills related to time management, attention management/focus, and attention to detail. Most faculty will give zeros, will not accept late work, and will expect that you spend 3 hours per week on their subject for every one hour you spend in class. That reality shocks a lot of students and causes many to fail before they fully understand how it works. I don't like seeing students fall into that, so I warn them. Good luck with your decision.",2025-10-13 15:28:22,4

I’m about to apply for colleges and my counselor is urging me to apply to ODU but I’m having a hard time finding information about what students think about the school, professors, social life, dorming/housing, etc. I do not care about football or sports whatsoever I just want to get my degree while still having a social life. I’d appreciate if you guys could share your opinions about the school, especially nursing majors!! Edit: Just wanted to point out I live around Richmond so I’m not familiar with the area of the school. I’m also a woman but I grew up in quite sketchy areas (outside of US) so I know how to avoid trouble, regarding many people pointing safety concerns. I’m also going to attend on campus and I’m not sure if I’m housing or dorming yet! My other options are VCU, Christopher Newport, JMU, GMU, UMW, Radford, etc.",2025-10-24 08:52:33,17

I loved the teachers, I did student work study program and got to deliver classroom equipment and do quality control checks of class rooms, and as a grad student I was able to teach a computer lab class. It was some of the best times I've had and made life long friends. The campus is quite pretty, you have a good deal of food options. Norfolk has a great food scene.",2025-10-24 13:46:02,9
comment,What do yall think about ODU?,For a nursing major ODU is ur best bet in this area. ODU and EVMS just merged so ur gritted a place in their nursing school. It’s a very diverse campus and tons of clubs to join and make friends. Most students are really nice and easily approachable. The professors are generally okay sometimes not so much but over all pretty good and u can use rate my professor to fund the good ones. Another great thing about ODU is you can take most of your general eds at TCC for cheaper and get them transferred no problem (thts the biggest highlight for me personally). Safety is for sure a worry on ODU campus but I’ve been attending part time for 5 years and never felt unsafe. The campus itself is typically very safe you’ll almost always see ODU pd around but the surrounding neighborhoods aren’t the best safety wise. I personally commute and don’t live near campus (it’s too expensive and the homes near buy are generally run down),2025-10-24 13:57:07,8
comment,What do yall think about ODU?,"Just my opinion the school/campus itself is good just the area it’s in is not. It’s in a hood that’s still gentrifying meaning if you don’t have a car on campus, you’ll have to rely on the dining hall or fast food since it’s in a food desert. The campus itself is very safe, just don’t walk alone at night. The students are very nice and there’s lots of diversity.

comment,What do yall think about ODU?,"as someone who also doesn’t care about sports, i think the school is mediocre. i’m sure there’s better schools out there but it isn’t the worst school ever. i chose odu because of the close proximity to my house and the cost of tuition. i commute so idk much about the dorms, but from what ive seen, they’re def better than other schools. the ones i’ve seen look “nice” but im sure theres ones that aren’t great also. professor wise, def depends on your major. i feel like my “worst” professors have been ones that teach something outside of my major. for example, im a speech path major, and my worst professors were for gaming and chem. i enjoy my speech path professors a lot actually. (coming from someone who despises school) social life i also don’t know much about, but the clubs ive joined have been great, you just need to put yourself out there. there’s lots of opportunities for finding things to do. moral of the story, i would look to other schools, but keep odu in the back of your mind. worse case scenario, if you dont like the school you choose, transferring is always an option. it’s a lot more common than you’d think 🙂",2025-10-24 10:49:15,1

comment,What do yall think about ODU?,"Here's a copy and paste of the email I got As part of Old Dominion University’s Forward-Focused Digital Transformation Initiative, we are excited to announce a groundbreaking shift in our approach to online education. After months of careful consideration and extensive research on student needs, demands, and the most effective structures to support online learners, ODU is transforming the digital learning experience to deliver unmatched flexibility, engagement, and access to premium online education. Beginning Fall 2026, all ODUGlobal (online) courses will move to an asynchronous, accelerated 8-week format. This dynamic approach is meticulously designed to be accessible, interactive, and finely tuned to optimize student success by adapting to your lifestyle and learning preferences. This means: Accelerated: All online undergraduate, master’s, and certificate courses will be offered in six 8-week terms each year (two in Fall, two in Spring, and two in Summer). This model allows students to take fewer courses at a time while maintaining full-time progress year-round. (Ph.D. programs are being reviewed individually.) Asynchronous: There will be no required live meeting times, though your professors may choose to incorporate optional synchronous components.",2025-10-24 18:49:20,1

comment,What do yall think about ODU?,"Yes girl, her exams are overly hard for no reason. She doesn’t even teach she basically reads off the slides the exams are getting to me also.. I failed the first 2 already, I just want to pass the class. At least the lab is way easier I have Anna Silver for that she’s very good. I do very well on the homework but the exams really is a flop. The practice exam also isn’t the same as the regular exam the questions on the regular exams are much harder than what she shows and teaches.

comment,What do yall think about ODU?,I would recommend you talk to someone on campus maybe your advisor just to verify but my understanding is that for online courses it's no longer optional to choose including for masters programs.,2025-10-24 18:55:28,1
comment,What do yall think about ODU?,"My perception is that they're not saying you can choose to do an 8 week course or not they're saying we are offering these classes for 2 terms in spring, summer, and fall so you can choose from which terms you'd like to take. I have several friends that go to ASU online where all online classes are formatted for 8 weeks and their terms are split into term A/term B.

I'd definitely look into it ASAP because I know registration is creeping up quick and I'm not thrilled about the change but staying because I have family employed at ODU and I get 6 free credits/semester so it feels like it would be a poor choice to take out loans if I don't have to,2025-10-24 18:59:42,1

comment,What do yall think about ODU?,I also found this which says the same thing I was thinking on the official site if you want to fact check my sources that's totally understandable!

comment,"About to be a new student at ODU, looking for advice.","Don't wait for people to talk to you. Take initiative, and if someone is dry, that's on them. Also, don't share too many personal details with new people about life prior to college. More specifically, people don't like to hear purely negative things (if any) about your past, no matter how much they may sympathize with you. Treat ODU as an opportunity to start a new, don't carry your old potential boring social life into this fresh start. Know people in your classes it's a game changer. Even if it's just 1 or 2 people, it makes a difference when you might be stuck with or need help with something. Be on top of assignments, do them as soon as they are given, and you will never have to submit trash last minute. Be smart with how you use meal plans and space it out for the week. Ex. If you got 10 swipes a week, use 2 mon-friday and then flex during the weekend.",2025-04-23 20:09:40,7

comment,"About to be a new student at ODU, looking for advice.","There’s an event during the first week (maybe it’s the week before) classes start where many of the organizations have a table to kinda advertise themselves. I recommend checking it out! As for fraternities/sororities, there are Greek (social [this is likely what you are thinking of when you hear fraternity/sorority]), honors (some tied to your major, some not), service (lots of volunteer work), and professional (these are often tied to your major). I love the professional engineering fraternity(Theta Tau) I joined, and still keep in contact with many of my brothers (almost 10 years later!) In fact, a brother helped me land my first engineering job, which got my foot in the door to start my career! As for making friends, the dorms will have you meeting a bunch of people, and you’ll meet classmates (highly recommended forming study groups regardless of your major!). If you are in the dorms, I believe (unless they’ve changed the policies) that you are required to get a meal plan. HIGHLY recommend getting the plan with the fewest meals, but highest flex cash (or whatever they call it now). You won’t want to eat at the mess hall 3x/day, and the flex cash is great for mixing it up. And the end of the semester you’ll likely have a bunch of meal swipes left over. If you do, other classmates (commuters especially) would love the free swipe into the mess hall. My brother and sisters used to study in the mess halls to take advantage of the food.",2025-04-23 20:53:47,3
comment,"About to be a new student at ODU, looking for advice.","There has been a lot of good stuff on here, but I wanted to suggest something to you that I learned way too late I'm my college career that might kill two birds with one stone with you. Study groups are absolute magic. I cannot overstate how much doing this helped me get my degree. You know how they say you don't really know something until you can teach it to somebody else? Well a study group provides you people to explain stuff to in spades. And if you don't know something, boom there's someone right there to explain it to *you!* And I certainly made some friends in the exam trenches this way too. But all in all, have fun, be your earnest self and be intentional in talking with folks and I'm sure you'll fall in to a crowd you'll enjoy. Also, go to professor's office hours!!! Holy crap I wish I did this more. Unless you got a real stinker professors love talking to and helping students.

There was an episode of “King of the Hill” where Boomhauer is showing Bobby how to pick up chicks. Boomhauer got rejected a bunch but kept persistent and ended up getting a number. Give it a watch. There are local game shops to support your tabletop interest as well as a club (at-least they were starting one back 2010-2011) . Be careful around 26th and 27th street and don’t walk around with both ear pods in . Keep good situational awareness and you can avoid any trouble the surrounds the campus.,2025-04-25 12:02:25,2
comment,"About to be a new student at ODU, looking for advice.","Like everyone else is saying, join groups related to your interests. I know it sounds dumb, telling you to just talk to people-- but it's true. People won't just randomly walk up to you in college. If you don't take initiative, you'll be lonely. There's many many student groups, and oftentimes on the corkboards around Webb or some other buildings there will be posters of current and upcoming events to go to, or clubs to join. Even if it's not something you're particularly interested in-- something new doesn't hurt! I was extremely worried about making friends due to my social anxiety when I got here but I joined the marching band and a music service fraternity and I have to say that I'm doing better in life than I ever previously was.

post,DO NOT LIVE IN POWHATAN APARTMENTS,"DO NOT LIVE IN POWHATAN APARTMENTS I just finished a summer internship for a subcontractor running network cables and hanging Wireless Access Points all across campus. While running cables in Powhatan, i saw some of the most disgusting shit that I can’t believe they’re housing students in. Each room has a closet placed next to the front door. Inside this closet is the AC/ Heating unit, as well as water pipes. Since some of these pipes run hot water, they are covered with insulation to prevent you from burning yourself on them. These pipes are so old, they’re leaking, which causes the insulation to become wet and eventually rot, giving way to BLACK MOLD. Keep in mind the pipes are right next to the air unit, so you are literally PUMPING BLACK MOLD THROUGHOUT YOUR ENTIRE APARTMENT. Other things I saw were floors wooden floors completely black from dead flies being stepped on, 1.5 inch cockroaches (yes I measured), and most of the windows don’t lock or don’t close.

You were wearing a plaid shirt that was white and orange. You manged to lean away from me and mutter out a ""sorry"" while I said ""yeah! How are you?!"" before realizing you were, in fact, not the friend I thought you were. By then, you had already wandered off quickly in an attempt to get away from me. Who could blame you?! **I'm so incredibly sorry.** It honestly bothers me that I may have made your experience on campus feel less than fantastic and my actions were in no way ill-intentioned though understandably ill-received.

I'm the lab assistant for ODU's game design major and the President of ODU's game design club, here to spread the word about our program!

If you are interested in learning more about either of these please leave a comment or dm me, I'll be happy to share more info with you!",2025-08-01 18:28:56,16

comment,Interested In Game Design at ODU?,"Our major is currently working on two projects. Monarch Odyssey is a mobile game inspired by Pokemon Go. It uses real world location but is themed around ODU, the game allows players to explore and learn about different parts of campus. Net Tech Warriors is a board game themed around cybersecurity. The game is nearing completion and the goal is to have it shipped to high schools to educate and get high school students excited about cybersecurity concepts. The club has also been working on a game for the last two years called Marinara Sweat & Tears. The game is a food-themed roguelike, like cloudy with a chance of meatballs where everything is food. Food weapons, food monsters, food environments, you name it! The club meets regularly during activity hours and we also host casual events like movie nights and game nights as well as game design centered events. The biggest event we host is a game jam. We host one every semester, it is a competition where students have two weeks to create a game based around a certain theme. All the students that participate are then able to show off their games at a special showcase event we host. Aside from these projects, many students in the major / club pursue their own personal game projects in their free time. Many classes in the major have ""making a game"" as the final project.",2025-08-02 11:54:35,3

The media choice. I don't care if the just said they like kittens. The second they connected ODU to an organization like that, they were in the wrong. It doesn't have to be malicious. It begs a lot of questions about their judgment. Child predation is not an area where one can afford to be reckless, misstep, or less careful.

comment,ODU Global Class Format Change,"Faculty here (not really anonymously, to be honest, but who cares), and I want to address that “not compressed” claim from that email. On the one hand, I can speak for myself and say that I certainly approach 8-week courses differently in terms of what is feasible in that time period. However, I teach in a discipline (Media Studies) where there isn’t really “necessary” skills or outcomes, and where the issue is simply the quantity of work as opposed to complex or difficult concepts/theories to wrap your head around. For disciplines where there are things you HAVE to know, and where there are foundational courses that serve as pre-requisites, they can’t remove content or change learning outcomes. And while there are best practices floating around that suggest relying more on quizzes and low-stakes assignments, there are some learning outcomes that are not served by those forms of evaluation (which don’t serve all students to begin with in the case of tests/quizzes). So faculty are in a difficult place of knowing what a course needs to be in terms of learning, and realizing what is actually possible in an 8-week format. There’s also the simple truth that federal credit hour requirements dictate that for every credit hour, there is at least two hours of work per week outside of the classroom. This means that by that standard, you are meant to be spending 9 hours a week on each course you’re taking, and that means 18 hours a week in an accelerated format. While we might reassess how that time is spent, we are ultimately compressing two weeks’ worth of time into one, no matter what that email claims. We want to try to make this as humane as possible, but there is a limit to what kinds of changes we can make before we aren’t actually teaching you anything at all.",2025-10-16 14:19:29,11
comment,ODU Global Class Format Change,"I think it's hilarious they're claiming they asked for our input and we were all onboard with this because I surely wasn't notified or asked anything about it prior to the email. I think it might be a decent option for core classes and even then it's not an ideal fit for many people to do expedited learning. To me, it feels like rushing through the semester so ODU can pocket more money. If it's such a great concept I'm wondering why on campus only students aren't being forced into this format as well. I know for myself, I work full time and do online classes for flexibility with my schedule and that's already a stretch at times for synchronous classes. I'm waiting on internship placement and learning how to benefit students by fine tuning instructional strategies and lesson planning for a majority of the classes I have left and I personally feel it's doing a disservice to students for me to rush through this content. I'm also wondering how this impacts internships because they're supposed to be at least 14 weeks for mine. I just foresee myself struggling to keep up with school and work having assignments due every other day and not having time to really study and comprehend the material I'm learning. If I wasn't getting tuition assistance I'd be immediately searching elsewhere.",2025-10-16 10:52:34,17

comment,ODU Global Class Format Change,"But the mandatory comprehensive fees were already baked into the tuition? Now its 'separate' but still applies to online students in VA (as for in-state tuition), which honestly it shouldn't. As a 100% online student, I barely use any ODU student facilities/activities. Only time I go to campus is for in person test proctoring, however I hate going up there as I used to have a testing center 10 minutes away. (Higher Education Center in Virginia Beach and Tri-Cities Higher Education Center in Portsmouth no longer provide proctoring services since mid Summer semester). I believe ODU is doing this to get more students to be on campus and get more money from dorms and meal swipes which are enforced.",2025-10-23 16:54:29,1
comment,ODU Global Class Format Change,"So, if you’re currently a full-time student (I’m presuming either 12 or 15 credit hours), here’s the thing: in their mind, and on a technical level, you won’t be spending more time. A student currently taking four classes a semester is expected to be completing 9 hours of work per class, or roughly 36 hours for the 16-week semester. And if you were to complete two courses in each 8-week session within a given semester (fall, spring, summer), your workload would remain the same - 18 hours per course, thus 36 hours per week. Their view is that this is actually easier for some students, since they are only juggling two courses at a time. And that may be true for some people, including some who are concerned about this change. But the problem is that with everything happening twice as fast, you have less breathing room if your balance of school/work/life has to change at a given point. “Catching up” in an 8-week course is extremely challenging, and creates so much less leeway for those of you trying to complete degrees while in the workforce. I am deeply skeptical of the administration’s position that one size can fit all, and that people need to just “give it a try,” but I do think that there are enough hypothetical benefits for certain learners that I will at least state their overly optimistic read on the outcomes here. Whether it works for you, I can’t say, but provided you ensure you are only ever taking two courses in a given session, the actual workload should not be “larger.” It just might weigh more, something I wish they would address more honestly.",2025-10-17 05:16:58,6

comment,ODU Global Class Format Change,"For the record, the administration’s position is that for the purposes of financial aid, they are not able to offer separate 16-week and 8-week programs. Does this necessarily make sense given that we currently do this? No. But when I asked the President about why it had to be all or nothing, it was presented as a logistical impossibility. And you’re right about the 18 hours - their position is that if you were taking four classes at 16 weeks, it would technically be the same weekly workload as two 8-week courses at a time. But this ignores the fact that assignments being spaced out gives you more breathing room to catch up if you fall behind. There’s no universe where that works for everyone, and I completely understand those in the comments both concerned and exploring options elsewhere.",2025-10-16 14:29:07,11
comment,ODU Global Class Format Change,"Short answer: yes. But as always, it’s an impossible task. Instructional designers have too much work on their plate as it is, and this particular task reveals the fundamental problem that they are not subject area experts, and thus can only offer best practices for a generic idea of what a class is designed to accomplish. They’re going to do everything they can to help faculty, but at a certain level the task we’re being asked to take on is just not feasible, and I fear that those best practices could lead some faculty to (understandably) concede to a weakening or thinning of their objectives. It’s less a distrust of the designers, and more the circumstances they are in. (They are also relying on external contractors to actually make the changes in Canvas, and my trust of someone with no investment in the long-term life of a class in this case is below zero). I’ve attended one of the three training sessions they are currently offering on a weekly basis, and plan to attend the others where I can. But I don’t think what comes out of a generic idea of how online classes work can actually address the challenge faculty are facing within specific disciplines.",2025-10-16 20:26:49,4
comment,ODU Global Class Format Change,I heard about it here as well and was telling my mom about it (she works at ODU not in a teaching capacity or admin role) and she was like um wouldn't advisor or someone say something before implementing this? I think that they probably aren't forcing this on campus students because they make more of a profit with them buying things on campus and of course for student housing. It feels like a money grab and almost like a punishment to me and I can't imagine how the professors are feeling. I don't think it's fair to them either. I might feel differently if it was posed as you can choose to take these expedited courses if you're interested or do a regular 16 week course if that better meets your needs.,2025-10-16 11:07:13,6
comment,ODU Global Class Format Change,I definitely misspoke with that phrasing I meant strictly on campus students not the ones that do online as well that was an oversight on my part.

This is definitely happening. I certainly suggest students attend open forums and make their voice heard (there are threads here on the Subreddit covering all that), but the President has made clear he believes this is necessary to address the enrollment challenges ahead.

He was also 20 minutes late for our final and didn't allow us to make up that time. I may be a little biased because I failed and made it up that summer but he wasn't a great guy in general. He just was always mad for some reason or another. If you need to take more math classes like precalc, try Wesley Davis or Heather Kunkel for (life science) calculus, they're great and actually try to help you understand the information.

comment,Samuel Gedon,You must’ve gotten lucky. He had a massive crash out after the last exam and went on a rant about how tictok rots our brains and that everyone in the class has an attention equal to that of a nat lmao.,2025-03-22 16:15:13,3
comment,Samuel Gedon,Omg yes! I would study the online questions and his study guides for hours and I still never did better than like a 79 on the tests. It was so defeating! Like I truly believed I understood everything and then on test days he would throw curve ball after curve ball,2025-03-22 16:25:15,2
comment,Samuel Gedon,His tests are unusually hard compared to the study guide and pearson assignments from what I’m witnessing (I’m in his pre-calc class),2025-03-24 00:59:11,2
comment,Samuel Gedon,Davis is really good. Professor Lee Land is phenomenal. She’s the best math professor I’ve ever had,2025-03-22 13:51:57,3
comment,Samuel Gedon,"Oh he definitely doesn't, and half the time he didn't finish notes for my class. Like he'd say we finish it later and he either posted a half ass video (I think like just once) or say he'd do it another class and just never touch on it again. I also hated his little phrases, like I know someone else said they liked his sarcasm if you can call it that but he almost seemed to try to talk like the ""youth"" but it would come out like a really bad big bang theory style joke and mixed with never learning made me want to skip so bad half the classes. He also never gave extra credit or curved, and with failing a whole class, I'm surprised nothing seemed to happen to him",2025-03-22 19:14:33,3
comment,Samuel Gedon,bro she (lee land) is the absolute worst professor i’ve ever had in my life i hope i never see her face again,2025-03-24 22:06:36,1
comment,Samuel Gedon,Really? What’s your take on her? So far I’ve had her and she’s been nothing but receptive. I’m online so my experience might be different than in person,2025-03-24 22:08:38,1
comment,Samuel Gedon,had her in person for calc 1 she was never receptive to questions would get defensive and just belittle us my first day of class with her she literally said if there was a school shooting in the VAB we’d die bc there wasn’t an easy escape route she was just so rude and i literally was one point off from a C+ meaning i had to retake the class,2025-03-24 22:11:52,2
comment,Samuel Gedon,Damn. That’s a shift from what I’ve experienced. The entire class I’ve had with her has been really streamlined. I have had half a dozen or more zoom sessions with her and we’ve had some pretty cheery conversations about math and engineering and coding etc. She’s been really cordial and every question I’ve had she’s been responsive within 12 or so hours by email. That’s kinda shocking to hear,2025-03-24 22:14:33,1
comment,Samuel Gedon,pretty sure i took the online pre calc with her and it was fine but calc 1 was a nightmare glad it’s going well for you,2025-03-24 22:16:15,2
comment,Samuel Gedon,Did you take the Calc 1 online? Or in person? I’m taking precalc 1 with her online. Going to take 2 in the fall and then calc next spring.,2025-03-24 22:17:06,1
comment,Samuel Gedon,calc 1 in person the second time i took it i had shaw and i think she was a better professor much nicer,2025-03-24 22:18:47,2

comment,Unfortunate,"As an undergrad on a cold January day, I moved on 43rd in a run down sketchy shack that has since been torn down. The place had a matching rundown detached garage that I investigated when I moved in. I found, underneath a wide shelf, a large open wooden box with a hat inside. It looked like those Eastern European winter hats, a ushanka. I always wanted one of them. I felt so lucky. I quickly pulled the box from under the shelf and grabbed the furry hat. Yup. That was a curled up possum like the one in the pic. When I grabbed it, I felt surprised to feel muscles and bones so I knew it was some critter. I screamed and ran back inside where my roommates were also moving in. One of them said as I ran inside, Did you hear that girl scream?

comment,Spring Refund,Me standing in the parking lot tomorrow morning as the financial aid workers pull up to work: 🤨,2024-01-09 23:42:24,14
comment,Spring Refund,"At the very least, they could’ve sent out an email stating a delay in refund disbursements instead of having us in the dark",2024-01-08 23:14:28,11
comment,Spring Refund,I wanna know how many students are gonna call the Financial Aid office today. I would assume a lot.,2024-01-08 09:57:21,11
comment,Spring Refund,"I got a hold of someone in the Office of Finance. She pointed her to finger at Financial Aid. She told me that typically refunds are processed sooner. Of course she could not tell me when to expect the refund to my account, but ""assured that it would be withing the 14 day window."" I asked about if their office could reach out to academics since classes have started and most student use their financial aid overage to buy books and supplies. She said ""they had no way of doing that."" I am gonna be 2 assignments behind in each class by the time I get my hands my textbooks. Eh. So I have to email each prof and hope they buy my sad story about refund? This is seriously f-ed up.",2024-01-09 09:20:02,10
comment,Spring Refund,"Frankly, I trying to figure out why they can't tell us a better time frame than within 14 days. If they are having a problem that is preventing the processing of it--they need to disclose that. Otherwise, it comes off as a lack of giving a f about it.",2024-01-10 06:27:36,10

comment,Spring Refund,Currently in my final semester and I’ll echo the statements of a few others. This is the latest I’ve ever waited. Usually the refund hits the week of disbursement or the following Monday morning. I’m assuming the fin aid office had too much champagne on New Year’s Eve followed by too much vodka on New Year’s Day lol.,2024-01-08 11:09:49,5
comment,Spring Refund,Just got off the phone with someone at aid office and they said everyone’s account is still sitting at a negative balance and refunds should start processing “soon”. A continuous run around only to be told we should buy our supplies out of pocket first if it’s going to affect classes. This is ridiculous,2024-01-10 10:08:25,6
comment,Spring Refund,"I sent out an email about the refund Jan 3rd and this morning I just got an email back saying “Thank you for contacting us. Your email has been received by the Office of Finance email tuition@odu.edu for student billing and payment inquiries. I'm sorry we have reached an extremely heavy email volume period at the start of the spring semester and apologize for the delay. You are currently enrolled in eRefund with the Saved Payment Method ""My checking account xxxxxx"". As of this communication, the refund has not been issued. We're forwarding your email to the Cashier's Office for review.",2024-01-10 12:00:01,5
comment,Spring Refund,"Called the Office of Finance this time and they said refunds haven't been processed. At least mine hasn't. The rep told me that they are processing slower this year and are trying to adhere to the ""within 14 calendar days of disbursement"" standard they have been telling us. The rep did say calendar days and not business days. What's interesting is that the final calendar day coincides with the last day to add/drop classes. I wonder if they are trying to process everything all at once. Instead of processing refunds and then having to process refunds or charges again depending on whether a student drops or adds a class. I know a lot of us have been calling different offices to find out information. I just wanted to do my part lol.",2024-01-10 12:40:27,6

comment,Spring Refund,"No refund either. Based on previous semesters, had expected it in my account last Thursday. Called Friday and was told that they're getting to it sometime this week and after that, it could take up to 14 business days. Do I expect it to take that long? Absolutely not but this is also ODU so who the hell knows? My wife is looking for a job and would happily run circles around the people in FA because clearly, someone or multiple people are slacking! If you don't want to allow students to utilize their FA to order books from the bookstore and have it come out of the FA before it pays for tuition, fine, but don't hold up student's refunds weeks after school starts.",2024-01-08 15:25:51,5

post,Accused of AI when did not use AI…,"Accused of AI when did not use AI… Hey y’all, I am so stressed out, I got an email from my professor saying I used AI for a paper I did not use AI on. I mean, it was a 1000 word paper for a FILM. He said turnitin detected it was 47% AI, which I don’t see how. It was a critical analysis for a film and we had to apply some of the topics we learned in class. I emailed him back saying I didn’t use AI and that once I got him from work I will share my google doc with him, and i even provided him with one screenshot of my notes taken from the class and offered a meeting via zoom with him so he can ask me questions about my process with writing the paper… I am a very hands on studier- meaning I like to take notes and write everything because it helps me comprehend everything. Thank god at least, and i also did short timelapse of me working on my paper because it keeps me off my phone and I like looking back at them… This really sucks. I worked so hard this semester just for it to be determined AI by another AI? AI detectors are so hit or miss.I’m literally going to create a case as soon as I get home from work and even contact the dean because I didn’t work as hard as I did for Turnitin to say it’s AI? What should I- Or shouldn’t do??",2023-05-05 22:11:10,15

She's exhausted and frankly demoralized. They didn't hire a new professor. This can't be normal. Can anyone give some insight on who to talk to in order to have this addressed?,2022-11-22 19:11:41,15
comment,My GF's Professor Died So the University Changed Her Degree Requirements,"Dean of Students maybe.

comment,My GF's Professor Died So the University Changed Her Degree Requirements,"If true, then It sounds like the issue is there is no prof who is qualified to do a specific concentration so they are saying she has to pick a different concentration. But this sounds not correct to me or at least worth double checking. Did she talk to academic advisor in the department (as in is a prof in the department not a staff person) or a general staff advisor for the college? I find the general ones often don’t really know the details of specific programs. Good luck",2022-11-23 02:41:54,5
comment,My GF's Professor Died So the University Changed Her Degree Requirements,"I'm assuming there is some misunderstanding here. It is not possible to just change degree requirements of that scale without approval by many people all the way up to the state level. As mentioned before they probably are not able to offer those two classes at this time and she is assuming or has been told she needs to switch. This is not required. The department chair has the ability to accept a limited number of changes to a course of study and still offer the same degree. This sounds exactly like a time when this should be used and they will probably be given wide latitude to make changes. As much as it doesn't feel like it sometimes, ODU does have a policy of putting students first when issues like this come up.

It was her Shakespeare professor who passed. So there was no immediate professor to replace him. Instead they restructured the program instead of trying to find a replacement. Basically she has 122 credits for a 120 credit program, because she has the old course credits that are apparently invalid for the degree requirement.

post,Advising Rant,"Advising Rant I don’t think anything can really be done but I just want to complain. I made an appointment with my advisor for today to have my hold lifted. We were supposed to meet at 11:30. I’m a commuter. I live at the VB oceanfront. I am only available to come up here on Wednesday’s because I work full time. I drove out here, payed the meter and everything. My advisor isn’t here. He isn’t responding to my emails or anything. So now I’ve wasted my time and money for an advising appointment that easily could have been done online. I’ve been waiting here for 45 minutes in case he shows up but it’s not looking hopeful. I’m just pissed that I wasted my time and money because this man couldn’t communicate with me. UPDATE: He just responded saying he needs to move it to 3:15.

post,should I report my roommate for drug use?,"should I report my roommate for drug use? Long story short, I moved into one of the college apartments with 3 other roommates about a week ago and today I packed all my stuff and moved back home (it's just a 40 min drive so I will be commuting to school from now on). My other two roommates are fine, it's just this one roommate who always smokes weed and has the apartment smelling like shit. He leaves his shit everywhere and never cleans up after himself. He always invites a shit bunch of people over and they yell and scream and play loud ass music with the bass all the way up and I just said fuck it and moved out cuz I'm not dealing with this shit. My question is this: I already signed the contract for the apartment, and in the housing portal they said under certain circumstances, you can cancel your contract and they refund your money. I saw in the contract that not controlling noise levels are a violation and that marijuana, tobacco, and any other drugs are prohibited on campus and serious consequences will be made. He had a big ass party last Thursday and I woke up Friday morning to see the whole living room trashed and apart from cigarettes, weed, and alcohol everywhere, I also found some empty syringes on the table which the guy threw away immediately when he woke up. This is another reason why I left today, because I'm concerned for my safety and idk wtf they're on. All I know is that im outta there for good, all I care about is getting my money back or atleast canceling the contract. I wonder if I should mention the noise and/or the drugs to make my argument more convincible. Any thoughts? Sorry this is kind of a rant, but I didn't know who to ask.",2022-09-14 00:06:32,15
comment,should I report my roommate for drug use?,"If it were just weed and booze I'd say leave it be, but syringes bump it up a whole nother level. As long as you've tried to talk to them first, get your money back, it's not cheap the live on campus.",2022-09-14 00:51:42,25
comment,should I report my roommate for drug use?,Yea might as well if you decided to move out. May get your money back or a new dorm,2022-09-14 00:13:41,17
comment,should I report my roommate for drug use?,If you live in a university owned apartment I would report him and possibly email the residence hall director about being moved to another place. They can be very accommodating when it comes to things like that.,2022-09-14 09:49:35,5
comment,should I report my roommate for drug use?,"As someone who use to burn in the dorm, I see both sides. Have you confronted them about cleaning and the music/guest. I always believe to confront the person before going to authorities. If you have and they havent changed, then yes, do it. Thats a lack of respect. They can easily smoke outside. Me personally i wouldnt want anyone to get in trouble, or possibly expelled, however you paid and have the right to be at peace",2022-09-14 00:30:08,1
comment,should I report my roommate for drug use?,"Weed is legal in VA, it’s like saying “he was smoking cigarettes inside” technically. I would mention everything but it until they won’t give you your money back. And say you didn’t really want to get him in trouble or some shit.",2022-09-14 07:52:17,0
comment,should I report my roommate for drug use?,"Yeah I see your point. To be honest, I'm kinda scared to talk to him. He doesn't exactly have the ""friendliest"" demeanor. I've talked to my other roommates about it, and they said that they don't smoke and that it does bother them but ""it is what it is"" and they ""tolerate it"". So if they're scared to talk to him then I am too, and my Mom was striving against me talking to him about it, as she doesn't want me making enemies there or ""get on his bad side"". What bothers me the most is the noise(and it's everyday) and I mentioned the drug problem just to make my argument more convincing, (but also I genuinely am concerned for my safety after finding those syringes)",2022-09-14 00:38:37,3
comment,should I report my roommate for drug use?,Weed isn't legal on campus because it's still federally illegal and ODU receives federal money.,2022-09-14 10:22:24,9
comment,should I report my roommate for drug use?,wait... syringes? I thought you was talking about weed. Report the fuck outta them. Doing heroin in college is a huge red flag.

comment,should I report my roommate for drug use?,"You need to grow up and confront your room mate about this. You have no idea how they’ll respond. But instead you decided to pack your stuff up and leave. I know this is harsh to hear but this is real life, I’ve had shitty roommates, and you’re going to have to confront them, because no one is coming to save you. That’s lesson 1. But, syringes does change things. Weed and alcohol and partying are one thing, syringes and possible opioid use? I’d ask what the fuck they are doing, what it is, and if it’s an opioid I’d explain that I’d tell management if you see it again, you’ll report him so they’ll have to break the lease. In no way should YOU be the one leaving. They should.",2022-09-14 14:42:19,3
comment,should I report my roommate for drug use?,Let’s be clear. It’s not allowed on campus because it’s a private business and it can make it’s own rules. It’s only illegal the moment they inform federal authorities about it. Virginia doesn’t care.,2022-09-14 10:44:45,2

comment,should I report my roommate for drug use?,"I totally get your point. I've talked about this with other people and some have mentioned he's the one who should leave, not me. And while I completely agree, my other two roommates are scared to talk to him, so it is not very likely he will listen to me. And again, considering the drugs this guy does and his overall demeanor, I don't want to become his enemy. I get him kicked out and I continue living there, well now he knows where I live and where I stay and that's not a risk I'm willing to take. I completely understand your point, and if he was a nicer person I would confront him but he is not, therefore I don't feel comfortable. These aren't just bad habits that I don't like, these are actual legit safety concerns and therefore I'm taking it more seriously. I appreciate your input tho",2022-09-14 15:00:23,2

comment,should I report my roommate for drug use?,"Completely understand your stance. I also understand that not every is confrontational like me.

I applied a few days ago, so not sure if ill get into things such as the honors college (4.517, 1510), but how overall is the experience?",2025-03-19 17:41:25,14
comment,How good is Academics and Food?,I’ll say I absolutely feel in love with Norfolk and I grew love economics more while studying at ODU. Del Vecchios right across from campus is the best pizza spot in the city and I know I went around town trying to find the best pizza place in the city. As far as academics my experience differs because I went there for grad school but I’m in a PhD now and the best professors I had were at ODU. If you love mid size cities with the ammenties of a big city without the pace and bustle you’ll love exploring the town and its history. ODU gets a lot of flack and I’m going to be honest it wasn’t a top school for me but it was in retrospect the best decision I made.,2025-03-19 20:04:18,8
comment,How good is Academics and Food?,"U will get into the honors college, dont worry. The honors dorms (ur own bedroom) are nice. The mess hall is fine, nothing to rave about but not bad. If u get the all u can eat meal plan (required for freshmen living on campus), u get 5 “meal exchanges” a week, where u can go to any of the actual restaurants in the Webb center to get a meal. It is good portions too, especially if you go to Qdoba or Panda Express",2025-03-19 19:07:43,4
comment,How good is Academics and Food?,"I had low hopes coming into this school but honestly I'm glad I didn't go to my dream school (JMU). ODU is my home. I love the atmosphere and area a lot down here in Norfolk. The food is not bad in the dining hall, it does the trick, but you will absolutely take advantage of the meal exchanges as other say Lots of places like Subway, Panera, Chick fil A, Panda Express, etc. The academics in my major are great, I've been given some amazing opportunities so far but it may differ depending on your major. Our engineering program is one of the better ones, I've heard. My dorm is nice and clean and I haven't had any problems yet as well!",2025-03-20 10:30:15,5
comment,How good is Academics and Food?,I can’t say anything on food but the academics also depend on the major you’d like. As far as the CS degree goes (my major) I’ll say it’s decent,2025-03-19 18:00:04,3
comment,How good is Academics and Food?,"I have kids at Tech, Radford and ODU. Food is 100% better than Radford. Lots of exchange for a fast food restaurants that Tech doesn’t have.

comment,How good is Academics and Food?,Not true. The crime is not x5 at ODU and gun violence is not rampant. That's a flat out lie!

I got a job out of college immediately built my career now I work in cybersecurity. I'm a tech lead for a DOD contractor. I make over six figures. Some of the most prestigious companies from all over the country come to ODU to recruit students. I remember when I graduated several three-letter agencies were there trying to recruit students. ODU's r1 status is what attracts prestigious employers to want to hire ODU grads. What they won't tell you is Virginia tech has really poor career management programs for students. They just believe their name Virginia tech is enough for students to be successful. A lot of major employees around the Hampton roads area, Northern Virginia and DC Love ODU grads. Why? Many of the executives that run the corporations are ODU grads or their kids went to ODU.

comment,How good is Academics and Food?,"Well, VCU is kind of an outlier, the campus stretches from one end of Richmond to the other and includes a massive hospital system. And definitely 20 something years ago Virginia Tech had a terrible incident. But, this information is available publicly. Like you could look up and compare between Radford and Old Dominion without any sort of credentials. I’m not saying it’s a bad school, it’s just certainly not as safe as many other schools in our state. My niece is at Longwood and nobody locks their bikes up there, our bike was stolen in the first few days at Old Dominion WITH a lock and an AirTag.

comment,How good is Academics and Food?,So that's what this is about a stolen bike now the university's bad because of it? Everybody's mad at ODU for making that big move with EVMS and attempt to attract higher profile students to the campus.

My admissions right now are looking like these schools might be my best options and I wanted to know if you guys had any input on the best one. Every source I've read has had varying reviews on both the strength of their engineering programs and their social life so I'm curious what you guys think. ODU I've heard specifically is a commuter school where it's hard to make friends.",2025-02-02 02:44:50,14
comment,"ODU, GMU, or VCU","ODU used to be a commuter school but has made a huge investment in its on-campus life over the past 20 years including adding dorms, student services, research capabilities, etc. Some students do still commute. Some students do complete online courses and degrees. But if you want a residential student experience, you can get that at ODU. If you opt for a residential experience, some students do treat it like a party school and get very little out of their courses or investment, but many take it extremely seriously. If you want to take your degree and your preparation seriously, making friends with likeminded people will allow you to have the experience you want. College is a resource rich environment but no one will make you do anything, so you need to be self-motivated and responsible to get the most out of it. Good luck with your choice and your future.

If you want to make friends/go to parties/attend sporting events, I would definitely pick one of the other two. VCU isn't a commuter school, but it is an urban campus so it won't have that traditional campus feel that ODU has. It also doesn't have a football team. ODU isn't very good at football, but the games and tailgates are really fun. ODU also has the most affordable tuition in VA if that is a factor for you. Because the student population at ODU is so diverse, I think most people have a pretty easy time making friends. I did, and I'm pretty shy. I am from Richmond and I chose ODU over VCU because I wanted a real ""college experience"" with football and a closed off campus, because it was less expensive, and because it always seemed to me growing up that you had to be super artsy to fit in at VCU because it definitely has a reputation of being more of an arts school.

comment,"ODU, GMU, or VCU",White students make up under half of students. That’s the definition?? ETA: all 3 schools meet the definition but the percentages are different.

comment,"ODU, GMU, or VCU",As someone in my last semester in an engineering degree at ODU I find those numbers surprising. Maybe the Engineering department skews white?

post,How can I resolve an issue with my professor after going to the dean,"How can I resolve an issue with my professor after going to the dean Hey everyone, I'll try to provide as much detail as possible without revealing too much personal information. This issue begins when my professor starts the class. Essentially there's simply to much lab work for the allotted amount of class time. To complete the lab reports we must complete the labs, but as we get closer the end of the semester that's now not feasible. To help us get caught up the professor has asked students to come into the lab during times that were never mentioned at the beggining of the semester. I am busy with work or other classes from 9am to 7pm monday through friday, therefore coming into those extra lab hours isn't a possibility. When I expressed these concerns to him he suggested I drop the class to avoid the failing grade. Essentially I've paid 3 credits worth of tuition for a class that I did not have a chance to succeed in from the start due to the professor mismanaging the available class time. Reaching out to the dean of the college was unsuccesful, as he essentially told me that it's my fault that I cannot make it too lab times that my professor might aswell have plucked out of thin air midway through the semester. I was just curious if there's any further steps i can take to seek some kind of compromise. P.s. The dean had mentioned online students taking this same course have access to a written assignment, but that option isn't available to me. The simple fix seems to just have anyone unable to make it too these previously unscheduled labs do that assignment instead.",2022-11-09 13:24:56,14

I promise you there is some office at the university who can help (or at least try) for these events.,2022-11-09 19:34:14,2

comment,How can I resolve an issue with my professor after going to the dean,"There may be additional details that might need to be considered. For example, have other students been able to complete the labs within the original hours provided? If so, then it implies that there may be issues without how you used the lab hours that were originally given. I'd like to give you the benefit of the doubt, but I do also need to consider the case I describe above. I have my own issues with one of the professors on campus (in that he doesn't use a rubric or a lesson plan, makes up most assignments spontaneously, hasn't shown very high competency in the subject that he's teaching, is very disorganized and loses student assignments, isn't familiar with his own syllabus, and appears to grade assignments and quizzes according to his emotional state rather than if the directions were followed exactly or the answers to questions are correct). I'm hoping that my case is an outlier and that the administration is likely to correct the issue. He is the first professor I've had since I started at ODU that I've had these issues with. I've currently been in contact with his direct supervisor in an attempt to resolve the situation, and haven't brought it higher yet because I'm giving his supervisor an opportunity to implement an adequate resolution. So while you may be in a somewhat similar situation, it would be unfair to not acknowledge that there is additional information to consider.",2022-12-02 15:20:39,1
comment,How can I resolve an issue with my professor after going to the dean,Im trying to avoid taking that W at all costs. If i do that means I'll have to take the same class with the same professor in another semester. Depending on when that is offered it may end up moving my graduation from this spring to next fall.

comment,How can I resolve an issue with my professor after going to the dean,"I had considered that scenario myself, bur after asking my peers in other groups its seems the majority were in a similar boat, and those that were not were able to go to the unscheduled lab hours. What I've learned since posting this thread is that the professor in question is the only one able to teach this course. So without him basically every student who needs that credit would be on hold until they can offer the class again. In short he has the school by the balls, and it this point some of my other classes have ended early and hopefully i can pull out a passing grade, if i cannot i have i believe a very solid case for a tuition refund and grade appeal.",2022-12-02 15:34:03,1

comment,How can I resolve an issue with my professor after going to the dean,"That sounds unfortunate, not just because it's a bad situation concerning the class, but also because it sounds as if the dean of the college was dismissive of the issue.

comment,How can I resolve an issue with my professor after going to the dean,That would truely be a last resort. The email I received from the dean of the college I felt was fairly insulting and Im afraid of that happening again. I feel like pleading to administrstion they'll get the impression that i'm a pissed off student that's too lazy to come into extra available hours to do the labs. Part of why I think the dean of the college responded the way he did. The reality is that I just like many other students here work as much as I can to be able to afford this education. To lose hours at work and/or skip another class to accomadate this professors inability to properly pace his class seems unfair to me and any of my classmates in a similar position. Do you have any suggestions regarding how I can best present my arguement to get some kind of accomdation? Frankly the whole situation is starting to feel like extortion with extra steps.

As far as I'm aware, the only accommodations that professors are obligated to follow are the ones from the Office of Educational Accessibility and those types require documentation from a doctor. IMO, your best bet is to lay out a strictly factual email to the Dean of Students office explaining the situation and your previous attempts to remedy it. I wouldn't try to plead your case so much as state your case. That office exists to help students, so they'll at least listen to you. Just be prepared them to say that there is nothing they can do.

post,For those interested in getting upper division gen ed credit fairly easily and at a fairly low cost,"For those interested in getting upper division gen ed credit fairly easily and at a fairly low cost Hi, I graduated two years ago. Saw a post on here that made me think that sharing this might help someone. Also this is aimed at somebody who isn't in business school as this is for business course credit. So ODU grants upper division business credit for the marketing and management CLEP exams. They are MGMT 325 and MKTG 311. [https://modernstates.org/](https://modernstates.org/) is a website where you can get free study materials (it's the only thing I used) and also you complete their course to get a free voucher for the CLEP exams which would usually cost $89. I think you can schedule the exam somewhere at ODU (I was online out of state and did it at a community college). The proctoring fee is usually $20-$30 and modern states even has a spot where you can apply for reimbursement of the proctoring fee. I'm also sharing this because these two tests are known to be among the easiest of CLEP exams and would only require two or three weeks of dedicated studying at most. It would possibly be something to do if you have downtime during winter break! I know this saved me some money so I thought I'd share this.",2021-10-27 11:40:51,14

I want to point out that there is a test called the DSST that has more upper-level courses you can test out of.

The upper divs I tested out of were Marketing (MKTG 311), Management (MGMT 325), Principles of Finance (FIN 323), Business Law (FIN 331), Human Resource Management (MGMT 340), Principles of Supervision (SEPS 302), Ethics in America (POLS 495), and Intro to Educational Psychology (PSYC 3ELE).

post,"With less than a week left before classes start, do you think ODU will move to remote before we start?","With less than a week left before classes start, do you think ODU will move to remote before we start? If I had to place my money on it, ODU will give a “good faith” effort and start in-person like other institutions have across the country that’ve transitioned to remote. I think the institution feels like it owes students, especially incoming students who enrolled with the hope there would be some version of a college experience. A hearty “Well, we tried” and a shrug. But I’m also torn by this paragraph in the Blueprint reopening plan (page 22). This feels like the situation will need to be more serious than the average student is comfortable with things getting. Criteria to be considered for decision-making include, but are not limited to, percentages of positive test results reaching certain levels, exhaustion of designated isolation/quarantine housing capacity, depletion of PPE necessary to keep campus health care and other critical staff safe, multiple outbreaks occurring in a residence hall(s), on- or off-campus virus spread that results in local hospital capacity becoming overwhelmed, multiple virus-related fatalities, and/or other unforeseen factors that create a situation beyond the university’s capacity to respond.

comment,Who is staying on campus this fall and do you really trust odu?,"A few thoughts from an alum who lived on campus and is now the parent of a sophomore who's gearing up to go back and do the same: > ... How will covid be handled?!?! The university has a [50-page plan](https://www.odu.edu/content/dam/odu/admin/blueprint/final-fall-semester-2020-reopening-plan-signed-07062020.docx) that has to be approved by the state before it can re-open. I've read it from cover to cover and think they're doing what they can, but all of this is uncharted water for everyone involved from the top down. As Prussian field marshal Helmuth Karl Bernhard von Moltke said, no plan survives first contact with the enemy, which means not everything is going to go perfectly. Next month they're going to bring a whole lot of people from a whole lot of places onto campus and try to start functioning like a university. COVID-19 cases on campus is a matter of _when_, not _if_. If there's a big enough outbreak or the state drops back to phase 2 or phase 1, there will be a repeat of March, when they told everyone living on campus to pack up and get out. > ...do you really trust odu? Since you're an incoming freshman, let me say welcome to college and congratulations, you're an adult now. College isn't high school, and while the university is going to do what it can to provide a safe environment, you're just as responsible for your own safety as they are. You get to ask if you trust yourself to have the discipline to do everything you can to avoid infection while living in relatively tight quarters with a lot of other people who are young enough to still think they're invincible (been there, done that) and may not have asked themselves the same question. The university can keep a decent amount of control over what happens on campus but has no control over whether on-campus students leave campus for less-controlled environments and bring something back with them or people from off campus bring it in. (Putting on my parent hat...) My daughter is taking exactly one class this semester that can be taught remotely; everything else has a significant, in-person component. We live far enough away that she has to stay down there. She's fortunate enough to have landed a slot at Powhatan, which I think has the best arrangements of all on-campus housing for minimizing exposure risk. I can't watch my kid like a hawk as I did when she was five (nor should I have to at her age). The potential that she could do everything right and end up debilitated or dead or bring the virus home and do one of us in is scary as hell to think about on a level you won't get until you've raised kids. We're just as nervous as you are. > or i could stay home but ugh that’s lame. (Putting on my old guy hat...) I'm old enough to have had grandparents who were alive during the 1918 pandemic and old enough to remember its impacts. My grandfather was sickened badly but survived. They had to make sacrifices, but they got through it. If this thing is to be contained, college is going to lack a lot of what makes it fun until we get a good handle on it. Putting up with some [lameness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKsaWbr3B-0) is one of the sacrifices you'll have to make, and I'm sorry about that because you probably didn't do anything to deserve it. I wouldn't be all that into it if I were in your shoes, either. Things are better on a whole lot of fronts now than they were a century ago. You can get information and entertainment piped straight into your living room, order food to be delivered to your door and attend lectures or socialize with friends without having to be present. When I graduated, people in my field were just starting to think about how to make those things happen and it really wouldn't be practical at scale for another 10-15 years. HTH.

So long as everybody you are rooming with is in agreement to try to be as safe as possible things should go fine since the school's already doing what they can to stop the spread in the end it comes down to you whether or not you think it's the best choice especially since you said money is an issue. But I think as long as everybody is on the same page with this everyone will be able to get through relatively safely",2020-07-21 10:02:33,2

Tidewater is rapidly becoming Virginia's big hot spot. Northern Virginia, where I live, went through this earlier and didn't re-open with the rest of the state because of it.

AMA!","ODU takes a hard stance on any form of sexual harassment and assault. As a former marine, we have classes, at minimum, quarterly to discuss sexual harassment and assault. I am not suggesting that, but many universities are turning to more required in depth education on these topics. The effectiveness is not yet know because these programs are in their early stages. I would like to work with the ODU Women’s Center, Intercultural Relation, ODU PD, and the administration to build a program that can actually help students understand these topics. It would include discussion on alcohol consumption, defining consent, and better process on the administrations behalf to endure those that commit these kind of abhorrent acts be punished. These processes need to move faster. They need unbiased and comprehensive review. Whether that is having outside investigators not affiliated with the university or working with the administration to better the investigation process, Campus safety is one of my top priorities. Tackling the always difficult topic of sexual assault can be trying for anyone, but that can only start with serious questions and dialog. I am committed to finding a way as a community to make it better.",2019-03-05 10:30:33,5

It can be a heavy workload sometimes, but I pride myself on time management and priorities. I currently do not have children or am married, so much of my home life is spent here at the ODU campus working on projects to better the community. Most students would agree that Classes come first. I agree with that, but I can take the extra downtime I have and apply it to this great university and it's people. I challenge every student to take just a little downtime and use it to better this community. ODU could only become a more enriched community of amazing cultures, diverse students, and highly respected educators and administrators.",2019-03-05 11:32:09,3
comment,"Hello r/odu! I am running for Student Body VP! Background info in the comments. Want to get your comments, needs, and wants directly from the ODU Community. AMA!","This is a great set of questions. Troubles in school are not restricted to only veterans. ODU has thousands of students that are not your traditional college age. Currently, ODU has a couple programs that can help students in need and mediate between the student and educators. These programs are great, but there needs to be more. We have the resources to build an emergency fund at ODU that is more comprehensive and complete for the student that needs it. ODU provides financial counseling, mental health providers, and much more. The key is getting help before it is too late. I believe in educating the student. Helping them understand where ""too late"" begins is the most important and could solve many problems before they start. Additionally, everyone is different. Every situation is different. Foreign students, Single parents, Veterans, they all have different challenges. By coming together to understand those challenges we as a community can then begin identifying issues and confronting them yourself or in the case of asking someone if they need help. in turn that will eliminate the stigma of ""it's none of my business"" because although they may not want to talk about it, your offer of help may be what inspires that person to seek it. Next, I don;t feel like i deserve anything. I would be honored to have this position because I believe I can do a lot of good for the students and greater ODU community. Ultimately, I will continue to work toward my goals regardless if that is as the VP, senator, or any other student. I believe in ODU and their belief in me would be the greatest gift I could receive. Lastly, I am not running a campaign built on what deficiencies the other candidates have or don't have. I know all the candidates want the same thing, to make ODU the best it can be. I am not traditional college age, so the only thing I believe I bring to the table is my life experiences that I can use to achieve that goal. All candidates have experiences they can bring as well, so to answer your question, I don't know. I don't know because, like me, they are not serving the position yet and assessing what someone will be able to do before given the chance is unfair. We are all different, but we are all ODU. That is the important part, win or loss, happy or sad, and in successes and failures.
