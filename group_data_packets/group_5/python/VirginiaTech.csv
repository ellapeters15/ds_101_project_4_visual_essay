post,To the daughter of the woman I hooked up with last night,To the daughter of the woman I hooked up with last night I met her at TOTS Saturday night and she told me you were a sophomore studying neuro and she said you brought her out to have fun but then abandoned her to talk to “some redheaded beanpole.” Was really uncool of you to leave your mom alone like that especially since she doesnt even drink. Dunno why you would take her to TOTS in the first place. just wanted to let you know I took care of her and that she’s really sweet and you should be more grateful for her.,2025-04-07 12:27:32,2327

comment,"VT student arrested for $230,000 drug bust, over 10 pounds of psychoactive drugs found","Four pounds of ibogaine? 20 years ago no one outside of serious drug nerds knew about the properties of ibogaine, a hallucinogenic shrub from Africa that causes a grueling 36 hour 'trip' which has long been alleged to be the magic bullet for curing opiate addiction. When I was caught up in the oxy thing in 00s I had looked into trying it but the costs were prohibitive. From what I read about it, the ibogaine experience could be so grueling that unless you were trying for the opiate cure, you wouldn't want to mess with it recreationally. More extreme and longer lasting than ayahuasca, it's also hepatoxic and can be fatal to persons with a rare gene combination. AND super expensive. Everything else he had were your basic party drugs - I notice nothing ""hard"" - half of it is cannabis related. But four pounds of ibogaine? That's a real headscratcher. Maybe he had imported a big 'ol living plant and they're charging him with whole weight of it, although it's the only the root that's psychoactive - that's typical cop shit. Here's a reasonable BBC article about ibogaine. It's a very interesting substance. https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-17666589",2024-04-04 15:27:50,218

comment,"VT student arrested for $230,000 drug bust, over 10 pounds of psychoactive drugs found","There was a huge DMT bust while I was a student. Driving for BT my coworker had the Terrace View loop and they got rerouted. decided to walk over (I lived on Kabrich) and the first floor apartment was completely surrounded. Cops blocking the roads. I could not help but feel it was overkill, even for the bored cops in a town like blacksburg. Their practices are super shady when it comes to drugs. weed wasn't even legal back then though, so tons of people were getting arrested. can't imagine what it must be like now as a student smoking without the paranoia of having blacksburg cops sniffing around Edit: I hope Chris(?) over at nice dreamz is benefitting from legality. he was always a super cool dude to people and had surprisingly quality glass for a hole in the wall shop on Main",2024-04-04 17:26:33,31

comment,I built Burruss Hall in Minecraft! :),"That's a relatively new development. They built a transit hub just north of Whittemore and now all the busses to campus stop there. It just opened this past fall. There are a couple of busses that run a circuit on campus that you can change to there. I don't ride BT often enough to know how well its working, but it does make sense to stop the busses somewhere that doesn't involve them having to stop for on-campus pedestrians. And there are plenty of shelters for folks who are waiting.",2025-03-04 01:01:14,5

comment,UVA WILL NEVER BEAT US UPVOTE PARTY,"Think you're spot on regarding VT being unique and standing on it's own. It is folly to recast VT in another universities image. Blacksburg itself is a big piece of what makes Hokie alums such rabid supporters of the school. The New River, Main Street, the sunsets over the mountains, etc. If you want a sprawling and disjointed Rutgers or UC type campus, go there. Think Frank Beamer epitomized embracing the school for what it is, loving it and working hard to make that ""thing"" stronger. If Sands is using VT as a stepping stone, I hope he moves on soon. Think Sands hails from Purdue...wonder if there is something in his past driving him to inchoate the school.

comment,Was going through old work from elementary school. 10 year old me gave 27 year old me whiplash.,"I was a student and working in the 2nd floor of Norris Hall at the time. I was part of the group that evacuated Torg with the first bomb threat, since we had an office there and one of my coworkers found out very early. We were all brought to the theatre the next day by two FBI agents who showed us the bomb threats on a projection screen to ask if any of us recognized a students handwriting. The only thing that was said from anyone in the group was that “the periods are little circles - those are often common in certain Asian countries.” And all of that - as significant as it was - was wiped out a few days later by the tragedy. It amazes me that the FBI still says “there was no indication of who could have made the bomb threats” in their report after I heard that with my own ears.",2024-03-18 22:39:53,8

comment,Was going through old work from elementary school. 10 year old me gave 27 year old me whiplash.,"It was a weird time at Tech. The other thing that’s forgotten is that in the fall semester we had another shooter scare. I remember sitting in the big lecture hall in Squires when the police came in and told us to stay in place, then a few minutes later they came back in and told us to evacuate. No clear instructions or explanations just get out. It was a mad house and the cops were running back and forth (I just booked it away home and called it a day on the first day of classes) because someone had reported seeing the escaped prisoner who shot his way out of the hospital in the building. I thought then how screwed we would be given the cops response to the threat of a shooter.

comment,Has anyone seen this person?,"Here's the update: At 3 p.m. on Tuesday, Feb. 20, the Montgomery County Sheriff's Office distributed the following update. It appears in its entirety below. In regards to Jonathan ""Johnny"" Roop, investigators are continuing to pursue every lead; however, the preliminary investigation leads us to believe that he left the area of Montgomery County on his own Friday afternoon. Based upon information received it is believed that he most likely traveled toward SW Virginia or Tennessee. Investigators have been able to access video surveillance footage from local businesses/financial institutions and Mr. Roop was observed in the Christiansburg area of Montgomery County until around 3:30pm on Friday. Based on interviews with friends and family (in addition to video surveillance) it was noted that Mr. Roop's behavior on Friday was not consistent with his normal patterns of behavior; however, information received seems to indicate that he was alone. We have received no information leading us to believe that he is in immediate danger; however due to the fact that Mr. Roop appears to be acting outside of his normal behavior we would like to make contact with him to confirm that he is indeed ok. https://news.vt.edu/articles/2024/02/police-missing-person.html",2024-02-20 20:40:21,24

comment,Has anyone seen this person?,"Hi all! The most recent update I’ve seen is from today as follows: Update: Johnny was spotted in a Starbucks in Poplar Buff Missouri. Montgomery Police Department told us that once they have video footage of him being okay…they will no longer consider him a “missing person”. Starbucks told the police it would be 5-7 days before they release the footage to them of Johnny in the store. What no one is understanding is that Johnny is NOT okay. This is not just “school stress”. Whether it is something mental or physical…something is wrong. We have no clue what is going to happen. Our family is literally begging…do not give up on finding him. Please. PLEASE keep sending prayers for Johnny and our family. We have obtained lots of new information in the past 24 hours. We will post updates when we are able to, but the best thing everyone can do right now is to be on the lookout, and not just in our local area, let your friends and family know that live in other states.

comment,Has anyone seen this person?,"Cell phone ""pings"" are not always accurate. The process uses triangulation to find a location, based on signal strength returns from multiple cell towers (that's why cell towers have antennas pointing in three different directions). A signal is sent to a phone (which must be on to work) and the return signal is analyzed to determine rough distance and direction from multiple towers. Where lines intersect is the rough location of the phone. It can put a phone in an area but it isn't a sure thing.",2024-02-20 10:14:18,6

comment,Has anyone seen this person?,Sounds like he told people he was going to do one thing and did something else. When I was an undergrad back in 1998 a grad-student vanished from VT after telling his roommates and several friends he was headed home to his parent's house in West Virginia for the weekend. I didn't know the guy but some of my friends did because he was their TA. The dude was last seen on security camera footage withdrawing $80 in cash from an ATM near the VT campus. After he didn't show back up at VT the following week he was reported missing. His car was found abandoned along the route he would have taken home in Fayetteville West Virginia about a mile from New River Gorge Bridge. Apparently the guy decided he had enough of this life and drove up there and parked his car and and jumped off. The whole area around the bridge and up and down the New River was heavily searched at the time but he wasn't found until 18 years later when workmen were clearing brush around the base of the bridge.,2024-02-19 06:18:20,-51

Hard to fine someone who is dead but yeah, if Rob Kovack had just left a note in a sealed envelope on his desk before he ""took the bridge"" it would have saved a ton of resources that were spent looking for him after he vanished. They had helicopters flying up and down the New River Gorge, cadaver dogs and hundreds of VT students and other volunteers up there scouring the area looking for him. It also would have spared his family and friends from spending nearly two decades wondering what the hell happened him. Ironically while looking for him they found the remains of more than two dozen other people who had jumped off that bridge over the previous 21 years that it had been there but didn't find him.",2024-02-19 18:17:13,-1

comment,Protest today,"I'm at a university which directly funds RSO's (including culturally focused ones), and they can always coordinate with its SGA to get more funding for their events. Honestly, I would rather these sorts of organizations be led by genuine grassroots students being funded by the university where necessary than being ran directly by the university itself. I mean, when white liberals from the outside try to dabble into this sort of thing, you get terms like ""Latinx"", which no Hispanic would ever have come up with. Would certainly give you a better outlook on a given culture when you learn stuff directly from international students themselves. Just goes to show that losing this office is far from game over. If you can convince the SGA to do the right thing, it may actually be an improvement. (If you're wondering why I'm here, my brother goes to VT, and I stay involved on his campus, also bc I want to visit it. There are certainly many things VT has that I could only wish my university had, but this is one of few areas in which mine wins out imo)",2025-03-25 22:56:32,2

post,VTPD Last Night,"VTPD Last Night I would like to take a moment to appreciate VTPD last night for their calm and collected approach to making their arrests and not allowing the situation to escalate. One student from within the encampment was live-streaming and it showed multiple VTPD officers handing out waters to the protestors (who took the water while actively hurling insults at the very same officer handing them the water). They clearly and calmly answered any and all questions about why they were being detained and exactly what rules were being broken, all while students called them fascists and pigs inches from their faces. When the live-streaming student was detained, the officers calmly asked him to stand up to be handcuffed and explained his rights and what he was being detained for, and also assured him it was his right to continue recording if he wanted to. All while the student was screaming in their faces calling them fascists, pigs, saying they should be ashamed for doing their jobs. As we have seen all over the media and some of us in real life, some police officers will escalate situations like these for whatever reason. VTPD kept the situation under control and didn’t allow any insults to push them into escalating a situation like some shitty cops do.",2024-04-29 09:16:23,675

From the stream and videos, they weren't shoving people to the ground or beating them to compliance, I don't even think I saw one person wrestled into cuffs. Cops didn't go out there in riot gear ready for a fight either. They went in, announced they were going to start arresting people, gave them a chance to leave on their own, then set up a perimeter of the illegal gathering and moved in slowly and methodically as the protesters sat and waited to be cuffed and put in a van. With that said, this should be the baseline of what's expected out of police. Instead, our baseline is more violent across the country. It's expected for people to get beat and for many to end up injured or in the hospital on both sides.",2024-04-29 12:11:21,31
comment,VTPD Last Night,"I appreciate -- I REALLY do -- that the cops last night kept their calm and treated everyone with professionalism and respect. I would like to see more of that from policing in the United States. But I do take issue with the overall tone of this post and I think it's worth calling it out. Perhaps unintentionally, /u/lizthekidig seems to be suggesting that these cops went above and beyond their duty in their composure last night. This could not be further from the truth. Police enter every interaction with the ability to bring overwhelming deadly force to bear. Not only that, but the legal structures that surround their profession excuse and, in many cases encourage them to lean on that. The VT cops last night -- armed with tazers, night-sticks, zip-ties, and handguns -- faced peaceful protesters armed with words. They didn't crack any skulls or shoot anyone, true, but if we regard that as admirable we may as well be congratulating an NFL linebacker for not choosing violence when a 6 year old fan tells him he sucks. Yes, VT police acted with professionalism and compassion while carrying out their duties last night. But we should **always** expect that of police. It should not be exceptional when that happens; it shouldn't even warrant mention. Just as we would expect a waiter not to spit in our food or a plumber not to flood our house, we should expect a police officer handle their job and the awesome responsibility it entails without resorting to unnecessary violence. Yes, some unkind things were said about those officers. But, if you've ever been in a retail or food-service establishment you'll know that unkind things are often said to people just trying to do their jobs in those places as well. We don't congratulate retail and food service workers for not beating, tazing, or shooting the customers and we shouldn't congratulate cops for showing the same restraint.",2024-04-29 11:26:28,81

comment,VTPD Last Night,"You can blame Sands and the police for that. Protesters would have been asleep if the VTPD were not actively arresting people at that hour. It was also the police who kept their spotlights and flashers on until the early hours of the morning. Also, while the protest had been going on for days and the police had been on scene for days, it took them until late at night to be prepared to move on the encampment. Even then, they lacked sufficient numbers of police, as well as equipment to deal with it with any kind of efficiency. They had to leave multiple times to secure civilian vehicles for transport. They ran out of flex cuffs once or twice. They did not have magistrates on hand to process arrestees. By six am, a number of arrested protesters were given court summons and released (couldn't have just planned to do that from the beginning?) after being kept awake all night with hands flex cuffed behind their backs. In contrast to the disorganized and unprepared VTPD and in direct contrast to the spurious pretense of 'public safety' concerns, the protest was well organized and exceedingly safe. There was no violence. There were no drugs or alcohol or intoxicated persons. There was ample food, water, sunscreen, and medical supplies. Food was labelled properly and stored safely. There were hygiene and hand washing stations. Many wore covid masks, up until arrests began, because any face covering can lead to a felony charge in a protest. There were multiple medics and legal observers on site, clearly identifiable by their clothing. In their crusade for 'public safety' the first act of the VTPD was to arrest one of the medics. There was literally less than zero threat to public safety before the police action. I say less than zero because there were actual medical personnel and supplies, so the area was technically safer than under normal unoccupied circumstances. The only public safety issue here was the police action. And, yes, they could have been much worse in executing their orders. The cop who was giving out water was not unfriendly, but he also did not hesitate to arrest and incarcerate peaceful protesters. I know a lot of decent humans who are law enforcement, and we can love and respect each other as human beings, but they know how I feel too. When we say ACAB, part of what we mean is that there is no way to be an active agent of an incarceral state and still be the good guys. Finally, one of the pretenses being reported as basis for breaking up the camp was that the lawn had been reserved through proper channels for an event yesterday. Despite protesters, many of whom had been kept awake and cuffed all night, returning to clear and fully clean up the lawn early in the morning, the lawn remained empty all day, surrounded by police tape and unusable by any students. So, while I am glad that the police were mostly polite and were not more violent, let's not pretend like they were not the sole source of problems and the sole reason for disturbance until the wee hours. Shame.",2024-04-30 10:30:50,5

On a college campus where students may need to reach out to VTPD to report a crime, to ask for help, or even ask for a ride home with their Ride Safe program, it’s important to me to recognize that these particular cops WILL treat you will respect and that students here can still rely on them to help and protect them.",2024-04-29 11:30:45,30

comment,My Aerospace Engineer Roommate Got This For Our Apartment,"I was somewhat joking. The only reason the software engineering PE test was discontinued was lack of people taking it, not lack of legitimacy as an engineering profession. That's kind of the rub, though. From my understanding, the rigor of the PE is there in cases where someone needs to be there to sign off that a system or artifact will not fail. Generally, these are situations in which failure has dire consequences for human life. There are certainly cases in which human life is at risk in case of software failure, such as medical devices, but they are rarities. There are more commonly cases where the economic cost is great, but the economic cost of demanding rigor would be far greater. The economics of the situation demand that software development not be a rigorous field. There could potentially be a discipline of ""software engineering"" that services those life critical situations, but its practice would have some radical departures from current practices to allow a person to stake their career on a piece of software not failing when someone's life is on the line. I say all this as someone who graduated with a degree in mechanical engineering, but has been a software developer since graduating and has the job title software engineer.",2021-01-28 07:19:18,6

comment,My Aerospace Engineer Roommate Got This For Our Apartment,"This is an excellent point of view. I have my PE, and recognize it's largely superficial in most careers/industries. I also recognize that software engineering isn't just a cakewalk. It's not easy in any way shape or form. It's just different. One major difference I experienced working in two careers is that software engineering changes and adapts much faster than physical forms of engineering. Some of the core concepts will always be true... but to remain on the cutting edge, there is a greater emphasis on new technology, with a much shorter half life. In mechanical engineering, torque is torque, and an electrical ohm's law will never change. But the way software is constantly being rewritten in different languages and through different methodologies, (i.e. quantum computing), it requires a different set of ever-changing skills.",2021-01-28 07:33:33,2

I left my Software career behind after 10 years not only because I was being outpaced by recent college graduates or prodigies that were learning on newer platforms (I was unwilling to spend all my spare time learning said new platforms) but also because they were coming to the industry at much lower pay levels than established. I was in the low 6 figure range and people were coming in with quicker more adaptable skill sets in the 60k-70k range (this was 2004 or so.)

We were so stunned that we did not ask her name. &#x200B; Just a few years ago, I babysat a group of students doing a paranormal investigation. They had flashlights and voice recorders for EVP. I put a group behind the screen and another in the letter room under the balcony. We later came back together and gathered in the balcony as I turned off all the lights. The leader asked everyone to sit on the floor so as to not pick up the squeaky seats during the EVP session. After about 20 minutes of asking, Is anyone there? What's your name? Why are you here? the leader said, Unless anyone has more questions, I think we're done. Suddenly you could hear the very distinct sound of someone getting our a a seat.

comment,Virginia Tech student and athlete arrested for second-degree murder in Blacksburg,"From a Blacksburg townie — I would like to offer some insight. Jerry Smith, an openly gay man (nothing wrong with that), has been fired from local establishments for sexually harassing young men. I am a credible source, as I was a coworker at said previous establishment. Before this event took place, it was widely rumored that Jerry had been slipping drugs into students drinks at the local bar he worked at called El Centro Taco Bar. Not to speak ill of the dead, but stating facts, Jerry had a reputation as a predator. Knowing this information about the victim, it truly makes me curious as to what exactly occurred on the night of June 1st. El Centro, where Jerry was employed, has a very bad reputation in terms of violating ABC laws, not following CDC guidelines during the COVID pandemic, and for the past 8 months has been a hot spot for roofies. Additionally, rapes and other assaults have been reported at this location as well. With all of this, El Centro has never lost their ABC license, or faced any consequences that I am aware of. It makes you wonder, how are they getting by with all of this misconduct? Rumor has it, Jerry had ties within the Blacksburg Police Department. With this knowledge (understandably, speculation), I wonder how this investigation will be handled and if what truly happened June 1st will come to light. Regardless of what Jerry Smith may have been into, murder is a cruel fate and I am not saying he “deserved” what happened to him. But I just wanted to share the information I have of the victim prior to the incident, as I feel like it is a crucial piece of this investigation.",2021-06-02 19:06:28,176

comment,Virginia Tech student and athlete arrested for second-degree murder in Blacksburg,"Saying El Rods serves alcohol to underage people is completely a reach not to mention an unnecessary accusation on the topic at hand. Not only that, but it’s also a bit of a reach to say that he played such a huge role at Centro as It’s not uncommon for people to overplay their part especially when trying to network themselves. A lot of people help build a business and you may never even hear their name! I know the owners personally and they would never just knowingly allow such behavior to go on. However can we also keep in mind that even though accusations can be placed on someone, from a business standpoint you cannot always act on them ignorantly especially with no physical proof with the obvious and main reason being is a major lawsuit! Let’s not forget what year we’re living in! people will throw out a lawsuit quick for things they do not have proof of STARTING with defamation of character! We cannot place blame and leave a new and STRUGGLING business (thanks to the pandemic) at fault for the behavior and actions of the one of MANY individuals that were associated with this business AND many other business’s in the Blacksburg area. Not to mention as previously stated the said accusations were also never proven! The pandemic has left many businesses in a bind and we should all have more compassion of the Repercussions that negative and also ignorant comments could have on others lives. I would also like to point out the complete ignorance regarding this individuals behavior leading to this tragedy, considering this hasn’t blown up until said individual was “murdered”. Can we normalize taking a stand on someone’s bad behavior BEFORE such drastic consequences that lead to everyone pointing fingers trying to find someone to blame?? Seems that all these “facts” of personal experiences with this individual are now being aired and if everyone would have come together to prove such misconduct maybe the circumstances could have been different. Now we have one dead and one who’s life is now ruined for something that could have potentially been avoided in the event that someone would have just spoken up regardless of said “victim’s” social standing with the mayor or whatever business in the Blacksburg community.

comment,Johnny update,"For all we know the person could’ve been having mental issues or was overhearing a sports games. Occasionally those can be heard across residential and on parts of the drillfield and if you’ve never heard them before it can be confusing.

A lot of people who live off campus are only on it for classes and when they work if they do work on campus. I personally don’t live off campus, so feel free to correct me if I’m wrong.

comment,Johnny update,". . .except that his plan was to go home to Abingdon and be there by 5 to take an exam. I get packing up and skipping town for a weekend or longer. But the sudden change in plans with no communication from someone who normally communicates is cause for concern. &#x200B; >Point being, we don't know the whole story to justify jumping towards a missing person's case I'm curious what you think a ""missing person's case"" is or what justifies one. Someone who disappears without any communication, especially when they made specific plans otherwise, is a missing person. It doesn't mean there's anything nefarious or illegal, but that family and friends are concerned about their whereabouts. Once the person is spotted and seemingly OK, the case is closed. For example, there's a good book called *Under the Trestle* about Virginia's first no-body murder conviction. A Radford student was killed by a former VT football player a couple of decades ago. When she didn't show up for a planned date with an out-of-town friend, her family got worried and called police who investigated. Taking your ""probably enjoying the freedom of being an adult these people have clearly starved him from"" thought process, no one should have been worried; police shouldn't have investigated; and everyone just gone about their day.

comment,Johnny update,"While all of that could be true, it seems less and less likely the more that's found out. For example, the just dropped press release from MCSO says he was alone at the restaurant and left as he was being identified by an employee. A normal reaction of someone taking a break from life is to say to someone, at some point in the last week ""I'm OK, I just don't want to be bothered."" But to leave and say nothing, especially if it's out of character for the person, is indicative of something else. For example (speculating here), paranoia is a symptom of schizophrenia. For someone who's paranoid, seeing their face all over the news, all over social media could exacerbate the problem. Acting out of character while cutting off all communication despite the widespread outreach? The concern is valid.",2024-02-22 22:24:56,5

As a side, that's one of the hard problems with the mental health system. As long as someone isn't a danger to themselves or others, there's nothing that can be done. So you have people who get TDO'd, get medicated, get released, get off their medication, and the cycle repeats.

Also, shutting down communication from an organization with a PR crisis seems... counterproductive. * ""People from outside VT might show up and be disruptive!"" --- So? Attendance could be restricted to VT-related persons, but that's not cause to stop the event per se. Tighten security and escort the hecklers out. * ""People from within VT might heckle!"" --- Hecklers have been present at presentations at colleges for decades. Same as above; tighten security and escort them out. * ""It reflects poorly on VT"" --- How? You might question Boeing's integrity as a company, but that isn't necessarily a reflection of this individual's character. Possibly a reflection on his competence/efficacy, but in an organization of that size, even excellent high-level leaders' efforts can be diminished by lower-level employees. * ""There's nothing to learn because Boeing is bad"" --- that's overly reductive.

comment,Hmm… how has this not been cancelled?,"One other quick note re: the engineering v. business framing in some of the comments here. In Marc Allen’s talk, he addressed some of these issues directly when discussing the 737-MAX crisis, and how the company had to change to adopt a more holistic approach to engaging and serving their stakeholders. I think every disciplinary/knowledge area has its own ‘conceit’ that if they could only be left alone to ‘run things,’ everything would be perfect. Real organizations, even those run by engineers, require complex and difficult trade-offs that require organizations to engage a complex array of stakeholder needs and interests.. So while world-class engineering and design are essential — and no one in our group here in Pamplin would suggest otherwise — a viable organization still has to be built. These public conversations at VT with Boeing and other corp execs provide unique opportunities to hear how these leaders think about these issues and manage these trade-offs. They may be wrong. The approaches they use may be flawed. But in my experience in working with them through these events, in our courses, and other programs, the entire Boeing team is incredibly generous with their time and in sharing their thoughts while here. Whether you agree or not with their views is immaterial. Come hear what they have to say, engage in dialogue with them if there is something you don’t understand or agree with, debate with your friends, and figure out how to build your own leadership model that you think will work best. That’s the whole point of higher education.",2024-03-15 10:03:24,12

comment,We made it to the front of r/facepalm lol,"On the one hand, I loved seeing Lane packed and rocking again. On the other hand, I know some townies who are concerned about community spread after having 66k people drop by. As others have said, if it was only the student section then sure, having the student body 90+% vaxxed would help limit the spread. I think the potential issue is the tens of thousands of people who came into town, milled about for several hours, and had zero precautions to follow once packed into Lane. Personally I’d have done what some music venues have done where you either have to provide proof of vax or a negative test result. Yes, I understand transmission risk is lower outdoors. And different people take different risks. And that if someone went unvaxxed they may have to deal with the consequences of that. What concerns me is how we’re seeing more and more kids getting this, and hospital ERs being so full people can’t get timely treatment for non-Covid problems. Its a tough situation all around. I’m out of patience for people who willingly remain unvaxxed due to the harm it is causing our communities, because their choices can affect us all negatively. Sorry for the novel. Its been on my mind today after hearing from some friends in town.",2021-09-04 19:06:28,145

I was appalled at how no one was following any sort of caution. No masks indoors or out. No social distancing. People getting right up next to their friends face to talk to them because it was so loud even outside. I was honestly mad at all the non-students who traveled for the game. They are putting every student and townie who works in Blacksburg at risk. The townies don't necessarily have the same access to medical care and testing that the students have.

post,"Fall 2020--remote lectures and optional assignments and office hours, oh my","Fall 2020--remote lectures and optional assignments and office hours, oh my First off, I want to say that I'm not going to judge anyone's decisions (yours, the university's, etc.) regarding the upcoming fall. This is a shit sandwich of a situation on all fronts, and I'm nowhere near qualified to evaluate one way or the other. That said, I want to give everyone some advice based on what I saw last semester and how I see things shaping up for the fall, **especially those of you who will be first-semester students this fall.** Normally, I advise my students about parts of the course, the university system, etc. that I perceive as ""traps."" Now, to be clear, by ""trap,"" I mean ""thing that lots of people ignore because it's not mandatory,"" not ""something that’s deliberately set up to screw you over."" Pitfall might be a better word, [but I've always said trap, so I'm sticking with it](https://media1.giphy.com/media/3ornka9rAaKRA2Rkac/giphy.gif). For example: * Optional homework--it's a trap. It's not optional, do it unless you're already coasting. If I give this, I'm probably going to copy test questions from it. * Optional review session--it's a trap. Sure, it's technically optional, but if we're giving it, we think it’s necessary for some reason. Show up, unless you're already coasting. * That topic we gave one homework on and never touched again but said, ""be sure you know how this works""--it's a trap. If we told you that you need to know how it works, there's a reason. I'm not giving you long creepy stares after I say that for my health. There are also many things that I'm not going into that I *literally* beg students to do because it'll make their lives easier. Usually, it's only the students that could get away *without* doing these things that take advantage of them. With all of that in mind: &#x200B; &#x200B; &#x200B; **This whole semester is a trap.** &#x200B; &#x200B; &#x200B; All of the departments and faculty are working hard to try and make something reasonable. Still, I **cannot** see an end structure that doesn't result in a truly absurd number of things that aren't required, and that you can blow off with no ill effects in the short term. This will be especially true for video lectures. &#x200B; **Do not let these things slide.** &#x200B; If something has been provided, recommended, or suggested, **especially** now, it's for a reason. If you're comfortable with something after reviewing it, fantastic! Don't kill yourself obsessing over it. But if you're not super familiar, or even slightly uncomfortable, go through it. Many of the instructors have lost MOST of the tools we traditionally use to make sure everything is going smoothly, so some of that burden will unavoidably fall on **you.** &#x200B; The **number one thing** that I see students not do, especially in their first year, is attending office hours. &#x200B; **Office hours are one of the few things that there might be more of during this semester.** &#x200B; Compared to regular (in-person) office hours, they're going to suck (in my opinion). I'm personally working on ways to ameliorate the effect of remote office hours, but there's a limit to what I can do. That said, while I can't speak for all instructors/TAs/etc., most of us are more than happy to help out anyone that comes to office hours. This is also going to be one of the few ways that we can clarify things from video lectures, and possibly one of the only times you'll have real-time face-to-face communication. **Take advantage of that.** Keep in mind: * Office hours are held specifically so that we can help you with things that **you** want help with. * There's not a lower bound for something being ""worth"" being brought to office hours. If you have a question, we're here to answer. * You are not interrupting someone if you come to office hours; that is time set aside for **you.** Many instructors end up doing work during their office hours **because** **people rarely show up**. * Most of us are entirely comfortable with someone dropping by office hours (especially remotely) just to work, **in case something comes up**! I've had several students sit in my twitch channel during office hours, only to let me know that everything went smoothly before leaving. **This is fine!** &#x200B; Most students come to office hours the day (or night) a homework is due. Often, this is too late, especially when everyone is doing the same thing. Usually, I only have time for 1-2 hours of office hours on a given day. Having 10+ people in them with entirely unrelated questions means that I have, at most, 6-12 minutes to help each person with a problem they may have been tangling with for hours. Start assignments as early as you can, and **don't put off coming to office hours.** &#x200B; **If you've hit a wall, ask someone.** Send an e-mail to an instructor/TA, drop by office hours, etc. We won't judge you based on the complexity of the issue. The **only** things most teaching staff will be annoyed by are: 1. [Not trying anything before asking.](https://i.imgur.com/zJqx7cY.gif) 2. Asking too late for us to do anything to help (two hours before the homework is due, for example). 3. NOT asking for help after a significant life disruption (""I didn't turn in my homework because I broke my collarbone and was in the hospital for two days, but I know the class policy is 'no late assignments'""<--I have actually have had several students do something like this. **Do not do this.**) There are going to be **ample** opportunities for things to slip under the radar this semester. There may be FAR less that's actually ""required"" than normal. You may only have physical lectures in an extremely limited capacity. In addition to actually watching all of the lectures, doing the readings, etc., **office hours and ""recommended"" assignments/reading/etc. are some of the few ways to offset what's coming**. &#x200B; &#x200B; TL;DR: * Semester gonna be rough. * We're trying our best, but it's probably going to be difficult. * Optional work/assignments/lectures aren't. * Do them if at all possible. * It's gonna be super easy to let things slip. * Don't. That way madness lies. * **Come to office hours.** * **We want to help!** &#x200B; &#x200B; \[EDIT: Thanks for all the awards everyone! Hopefully this will help some folks for this fall and further one. I missed two significant points--the first was the point that [/u/wickedsweetcake](https://www.reddit.com/u/wickedsweetcake/) made in the comments about communicating with your instructors, which they detailed perfectly. The other is what [/u/trumpetkid](https://www.reddit.com/u/trumpetkid/) noted about the need to relax; I didn't include that in my main post because it wasn't something I was thinking about at the time, but with that in mind... **Take breaks to de-stress. You will not make it through if you don't.** This may mean reading ""War and Peace"". It may be painting. It may be watching absurd gameshows. Whatever relaxes you, make sure you take time to do it. Otherwise not only will you eventually turn into a human stress ball, but **you'll work less efficiently**. That means you'll have less time to take breaks, which means you'll work more and relax less, and so forth. I can tell you from first-hand experience, that's no way to live. As someone who's terrible at this, I've resorted to scheduling breaks on my calendar. During those breaks *I do not work*. That's what it takes for me to not let my work creep into my relaxation time, but whatever works for you, do it. Thanks again to everyone who commented--if anyone has any specific questions or comments, you can also feel free to DM me and I'll do my best to answer!\]",2020-06-20 11:36:12,595

comment,"Fall 2020--remote lectures and optional assignments and office hours, oh my","This is all fantastic advice that I hope you take to heart. The only other thing that I can think to add is that if something isn't going smoothly in the course, **tell us so we can (try to) fix it!** Even if we're actively looking for feedback, we might not be asking the right questions. The easy example is from the online switch last semester. I was originally hosting videos on Canvas and linking them to a page for each lesson. Then I found out two weeks after break that a subset of students were only getting the audio content of the lectures but no video because of a weird codec issue. Just switching things around to hosting videos on YouTube was a trivial fix. Imagine how much of a change it is for us to go from being able to see your faces and register the confused/bored/attentive expressions to primarily having one-way communication in the lectures. We're not going to be able to adapt mid-lecture, let alone across several lectures without some feedback. If the lectures seem to be going too slow/too fast, **tell us** so that we can poll the full class and adjust as needed. If some explanation in a lecture was confusing, **tell us** so that we can revisit it in the next video, or dedicate a short ""optional"" lesson to digging into more detail. If you're reading an assignment spec and just have no idea where to start, **tell us** so that we can provide a hint to the full class. If a sizable percentage of you are also taking class X in another department and you have a big assignment/project/test due on the same day that something equally weighty is due in my class, **tell me** so that I can flex the calendar (probably not all instructors are willing to do this, but many are). tl;dr: We need to know when and where problems are happening, even if we're being proactive in trying to find them.",2020-06-20 14:05:10,20

With Zoom and everything there are a lot more interactive ways we can help you out with stuff and since everyone is in the same boat, we were trying to be extra helpful with any questions you have. Make use of that because one on one interactions during these times are going to be invaluable to you too. Mentally, it will help you be more comfortable with the course as well!

With larger classes, it's hard to say, but I suspect we'll see reduced in-person attendance in order to maintain social distancing within classrooms, and all other material provided online, or a complete switch to online. With respect to their plan for handling outbreaks, all of what I know comes from [VT's COVID page](https://vt.edu/ready/for-students.html#residence), but my guess is they'll have rooms set aside for quarantine (ctrl+f isolation on that page) in the event of infection, in addition to the other precautions. As far as how that works academically, my guess is those policies are being worked on we speak. &#x200B; All of that said, every single thing that's been planned could change entirely--we're essentially two months out from the start of the semester, and a lot could happen between now and then.",2020-06-20 17:04:45,4

comment,We will prevail. We are Virginia Tech.,"I totally get where you're coming from but I think there's a few things to also consider here: For me, most notably would be how would the survivors (parents/friends) feel about their loved one's memorial being right next to him? How would the victims feel about it? I'm aware some of the parents have come out and said that they forgive him but I'd consider that a coping mechanism. As for him not being born a killer, and the below comment of killers being created, I think there are a lot of psychiatrists that would disagree. There are people who are brought up in the most loving households by parents and siblings that dote on them and they still go on to be psychopaths. Cho was a fucked up individual from birth and I remember his family back in South Korea attesting to it. He was a popular kid in middle school in NoVa and still hated everyone. When Columbine happened, he was fascinated by it and wanted to ""out do"" them. He started writing things in his notebooks about how he wanted everyone to burn in hell. He was identified by his professors as a problem but since he didn't do anything overtly violent, legally there was nothing they could do. He was flagged in systems, removed from classes (including Nikki Giovanni's) and asked to get help at Cook several times. They couldn't force him to do so. To say ""we (VT)"" failed him is an insult to all the people who tried to help him in my opinion.

comment,No comment,"Sorry to highjack, but trying to get my opinion out and having a hard time. This morning I was approached by a reporter for WSLS 10 about the picture that I posted to this subreddit yesterday. I agreed to an interview as long as my opinion was accurately portrayed. **It was not.** Although they did take direct quotes from me, they did not accurately represent my opinion of the situation. I now want to clarify my point of view since the interview was cherry picked to fit their narrative. First of all I wanted to make it exceedingly clear that I do not believe anyone should lose their job or career over what happened yesterday. I said this at the very beginning of the interview and made it very clear that I wanted it to be known that this was my stance on it. Everyone that entered that room took a **personal choice** to do so, and I believe that everyone should always have the freedom to make their own personal choices. The responsibility should fall on each individual. If you want to take classes online, take classes online. If you want to take classes in person, take them in person. Second; my biggest issue about the situation was that I didn't have a seat to sit in... WSLS made it appear that I thought this was an absolute tragedy and strictly about Covid-19 exposure. If I didn't feel safe in that room, **I would not have entered it.** I talked about how sometimes logistics break down and we as a society run into problems. We all make mistakes, even the interviewer shook my hand when they shouldn't have. We need to be very careful that we are not inventing solutions that are worse for us than the original problem. I talked about how people are avoiding going to the hospital for life threatening medical emergencies because they are so afraid of Covid-19. I also stated that I believe that the current strategy is putting more students at risk for depression and possible suicide than the risks they face from Covid-19. The majority of cases at VT are antibody cases which means that you have already gotten over it. Everyone I talk to on campus is desperate for social interaction, they are extremely stressed about their grades because there are less opportunities to study with a group. Third; I stated that I do think that VT and Blacksburg should not be requiring masks in the city on sidewalks and that they have been unfairly strict on students. I don't believe masks should be mandated, but **I do think you should choose to wear a mask**. I stated that trying to keep college students from partying is like prohibition; it simply will not work. A large part of the college experience is socializing, and not necessarily partying and drinking either. I commend VTs efforts to try to give us as much of a college experience as they can. Finally, I discussed with the interviewer how the political environment and media are doing exactly what they did to me today. They are twisting everything to fit their point of view, to the point that it is exceedingly obvious. People are losing faith in our government and our media, which means less people are trusting the advice given by the media and government. **TL;DR Biased media is biased. See you in person, in class, tomorrow. :)** [https://www.wsls.com/news/local/2020/08/25/photo-of-crowded-classroom-worries-some-virginia-tech-students/](https://www.wsls.com/news/local/2020/08/25/photo-of-crowded-classroom-worries-some-virginia-tech-students/)",2020-08-25 19:33:54,9

post,Lack of Goth Girls,"Lack of Goth Girls As a freshman boy at Virginia Tech, I am saddened at the lack of goth girls who attend here. The majority of girls here are Blonde Taylor Swift Starbucks girls who seem to lack personality and originality. The underrepresentation of the goth girl subculture at VT is likely tied to a few aspects, how it is notorious for its partying, (not typically a goth girl interest) the constant vibrant and sunny atmosphere, (ditto), and the overall lack of diverse appeal. I know that my fellow VT male brethren are also disappointed at the lack of goth mommies here, they likely just conceal their pain better than I am capable of. Every single day I wake up and do my morning prayer hoping to spot an emo goth girl somewhere around campus, but alas, to no avail. Perhaps I am merely looking in the wrong places. If anyone knows where to find them please message me ASAP. Or if you are a goth girl reading this, don’t be afraid to shoot me a DM. I believe without finding a goth girl my mental health will continue to plummet and I’m afraid to know what I’m capable of if that happens. I may have to look into transferring if this issue does not get resolved. Any tips are much appreciated, thanks! edit: Thank you all for your participation and input, it was very enlightening! credit goes to u/MedicalInspector6374 and please do not message me as I am just a girl...",2023-11-08 01:51:39,545

comment,Lack of Goth Girls,"May not work for you, but this is how I’ve found and bagged. For finding goth women, hit up Milk Parlor for band nights, find local bands chat and find your way to the house shows. Start skating, going out more, and you’ll find goth girls eventually. As for tips on how to bag, I’d start with making sure you’re a drug addict(this helps A LOT). Once you see a goth girl that you’d let peg, cut, and abuse you. Find your balls and go up to them. I always start off with telling them I dig whatever seems to have taken the longest to style or find. They’ll eat this up if they dig u. Following this, I transition to music. It’s imperative to have some form of “something about life isn’t so great” music taste(metal, certain rock, and maybe some hyper-pop). Talk about your interest in some songs and make sure to ask them what they like. Then act interested, etc. If everything has gone smoothly, you hit ‘em with the “you smoke?” If they do, invite them to yours. If yes, get there, turn on the tunes ask ‘em to play some shit, roll up, and mission success. It’s imperative you don’t misgender and that you match the clothing vibe. Good luck virgin🫡",2023-11-08 02:46:04,232

comment,Lack of Goth Girls,"Former goth/industrial girl here. I see that nothing has changed since 1997 - 2002 when I was at VT. In my case, I used to settle for emo/punk or jock types that just happened to like metal, etc. until I finally met a fellow goth/industrial guy 3.5 years in. Married him in 2002 and we're still together with a house, kids, etc. These days we look/dress like ""normal"" people so that we can keep jobs that pay for it all. However, our music tastes are the same and we went to see Skinny Puppy and Depeche Mode this year. This advice is 20+ years old, but it seemed like the few goth/industrial girls were architecture, interior design, biology or chemistry majors (in general, look for smart girls and you'll find goth girls). My husband and the other couple of goth guys he was friends with were CS or engineering majors. We both avoided business majors like the plague.",2023-11-08 09:03:51,55

comment,Lack of Goth Girls,"Anniversary Gifts: Gothic Edition Ever since Aleister Crowley wrote the definitive list of wedding anniversary gifts in 1899, the tradition has carried on with presents of Paper for the first anniversary, Gold for the 50th, Diamond for the 60th, and many fun ventures in between. But what can the discerning goth give a loved one or polycule for their anniversary while avoiding the common Victorian tradition? Here is the official list by the most famous goth of all, Orval Madden: 1- Spider-Themed Jewelry 2- Black Leather Or PVC 3- One (1) Vincent Price Movie On VHS 4- Barnes & Noble’s Leatherbound “Complete Works of Edgar Allan Poe” 5- Cloth Cut From A Condemned Clergyman, Or A Nice Hourglass With A Little Silver Skull On It 10- Darkness, Sadness, And Pain (Written In Calligraphy On Framed Parchment) 20- Bloodborne for PS4, Or One (1) Tear From Your Cheek In A Glass Vial 30- Complete Skeleton Of A Small Animal, Or One (1) Human Bone 40- All Siouxsie “MixTape” On A Wax Phonograph Cylinder 50- Live Bats 60- Your First Childhood Toy, Damaged By Time And Neglect, Which Once Unveiled Reminds You Of The Last Time You Felt Hope And Grew Painfully Beyond it, Declaring That You Would No Longer Feel, Only Days Later Meeting Your True Love, Tragically Forever Unable To Embrace Them With Anything More Than A Sad Memory Of What You Once Believed Love Could Be. 66- Bela Lugosi’s Corpse",2023-12-18 06:42:43,1

comment,Bud with the Hot take 🔥,"I absolutely agree that everyone needs to care and make every effort at advancing political education. However, the ability to engage in politics is itself a privilege in our system- leading to the wonderful contradiction that those who can least afford to not engage in politics often can't afford to engage in politics. Learning political theory, keeping up with current events, and organizing political actions take time and money. If you're a working mother making minimum wage, you have neither. If you're a well-off suburban housewife, you have both. It's only when things get *really* bad that those with the least free time and money to spend are going to use it to affect political change- leaving a political system dominated by those with the privilege to engage in it, who will almost always use that domination to protect their privileges.",2020-09-30 17:56:22,6

You can still be informed and involved by voting without having to partake in all the nonsense. And you can still learn to live within a system that didn't provide the outcome you wanted until your next opportunity to participate; you don't have to be constantly fighting for change if you have other priorities.

comment,Bud with the Hot take 🔥,"Oooooooh, okay, so I have a lot to say. First, if you watch it, start with episode 3. The first two episodes aren’t really episodes and theyre just celebratory animations for getting turned into an anime. Second, this show is the funniest shit you will ever see. [Here’s an idea of what you can expect.](https://imgur.com/a/e5hGLP3) Third, most of the Gintama community agrees that it’s “slow.” Meaning, the later episodes are MUCH MUCH better than the earlier ones. This is not to say the early episodes are bad. They’re still fantastic. It’s just the later episodes are really that good. If you find you don’t like this show 30 episodes in, stop watching it. There’s no point in going on trying to get to the good stuff because there’s no guarantee the good stuff will even be “good” to you if you don’t like the less good stuff, if that makes sense. Fourth, this show has everything. It started out as a comedy, but it turned into a masterpiece Shonen. It’s funny, heart warming, heart breaking, intense, and everything in between. I am convinced that episodes 304-305, if you ever make it that far, are two of *the* best episodes in all of anime. Finally, the voice acting is as good as it gets. Grade A actors all around.",2020-09-30 12:55:11,3

comment,Don’t touch the cenotaph.,"Upon my first visitor tour / prospective student tour here at VT, I was made aware what the pylons and what the memorial stood for. When I had been accepted and attended orientation I was again reminded what these stood for through yet another tour. Upon living in my llc, my mentor then again took a group of us for a tour and yet again, reminded us what the pylons and memorial resembled. Using the excuse, ""I've been here 4 years and didn't know what this was"" is bs in my eyes. Even having not lived in any of the llc, or having not lived in the Corp, every undergrad student is made aware of the fact that this is VT. The pylons are smack in the middle of the campus. You can't be serious to say you don't know not to sit on a memorial? Even if you didn't know what these pylons and memorial meant, you will tell me to my face that for 4 years you walked by this memorial, and never asked yourself, ""I don't know what this is for, let me search it up."" Even if you don't give a crap, you perhaps didn't think, ""hmmmm never seen anyone do this before, let me do it"" The pylons ARE just as IMPORTANT to the ""VT EXPERIENCE"" as enter sandman in lane. In a school that is focused so much on community, this is absurd. Instead of just coming here to get wasted and go to a ""football"" school, maybe some of my peers should use their brains for a minute out of the day and think, ""maybe this is not a good idea."" To be honest, the pylons are the most important thing at this school alongside the April 16th memorial.",2025-05-02 10:55:34,2

comment,Don’t touch the cenotaph.,The Corps requires cadets to know the name. There's a 24 hour rotating guard ceremony at least once a year. It's a big deal. Two Corps graduates died in the Iraq war and another Virginia Tech graduate who wasn't in the Corps. Ceremonies were held there. I'm sure not intentionally insensitive but it's the kind of thing that should get people fined or banned or both. Like Ozzy Osbourne getting arrested and fined $40 ($100 today) for urinating on the cenotaph at The Alamo.

comment,Don’t touch the cenotaph.,"No, because how would most people know? This isn’t exactly something that’s commonly talked about, and most students aren’t frequenting that part of the pylons on a regular basis. I’m graduating this spring, I wouldn’t know the cenotaph even existed had I not taken pylon club pictures there two years ago. All it takes for someone to do something like this is missing one warning inscribed in the stone itself iirc, evidently not very fuckin clearly if this is happening so often. Did you know the raised platform is also considered revered ground that you’re not supposed to touch either? I certainly didn’t, and I bet you didn’t know that either. That’s the problem. I’m baffled that, at an engineering school of all places, people are constantly getting so upset at the strangers who do this but not the poor design of the monument that allows it to happen again and again. To me, the school disrespects the names more than any one person because their shitty design just repeatedly invites people who don’t know any better to come and disrespect it. This is never a problem with the 4/16 memorial, why do you think that is?",2025-04-30 18:49:30,-14

comment,Don’t touch the cenotaph.,"It's not, even though maybe it should be. That said, you have reminded me of a story which I will now tell. Some years ago my family was in Washington DC in the middle of summer doing the monument thing. It was crazy hot and we sat down in some shade at the WW2 memorial to give the kids - 3 or 4 at the time - some water and a snack. And by the time I turned back around both were shoeless and wading in the fountain. A park ranger came up to them to tell them to get out and, about half way though his speech about the solumnity of the monument a really old dude in a ""WW2 Vet"" hat interrupted him and explained that he and his friends didn't spend the winter of '44 being shelled in some god forsaken French thicket so he could tell little kids not to play in a fountain. I don't know who that guy was but I don't think I've ever been prouder of my country. I think about him a lot, especially when people try to press-gang the military into providing some pomp and circumstance for their own political agenda. But yea, people should stay off the cenotaph (or however it's spelled). That said, the signage could be a lot better",2025-04-30 21:02:18,60

comment,Don’t touch the cenotaph.,"> This is never a problem with the 4/16 memorial, why do you think that is? People do pose for photos on the top of the wall overlooking the 4/16 memorial though. I don't think that's disrespectful though. It is a design consideration. For starters, the 4/16 memorial blocks are not of a size, shape, or height where a person would ever really WANT to stand/sit on them. They also -- deliberately or not -- look like grave markers. I've overheard plenty of folks wondering if the 32 are buried there (they aren't). But I agree, the signage and the overall design of the cenotaph could be much, much clearer. Of course, that ship has sailed. You can't just rip the damn thing up and start over. It has its own history now. But if VT had it to do over again or somehow found the political will to renovate it, I would suggest incorporating water into the design. By replacing the raised dias its on with a (mostly) still pool of water and allowing a constant stream of water to flow over the stone you would STRONGLY discourage people from getting on top of it. There might be erosion issues and you'd have to heat it a little in the winter, but those seem like solvable problems. Random thought: birds must crap on the thing. Is someone from the Corps of Cadets assigned to clean it off or something?",2025-04-30 22:18:39,3

There are probably more options, but this just is a shitty situation and without knowing the thought process, many schools are in a similar boat.

comment,Grad students are some of the best people at this university and they are being mocked and derided by the university,Honestly that’s the story of academia. Even into professorship people struggle to survive. STEM fields are “publish or die” and grants makes or breaks you. Many of the faculty here face the same issues but are told that’s just the way it is. It’s wrong and academia as a whole needs reform and to refocus on education and research for it’s own sake rather than money and fame. (I’m a grad student in clincal psych),2022-02-25 02:18:13,80

Because that's the deal I have and I'm worried partially because I thought I'd be able to live pretty comfortably on that, but also I'm genuinely curious if there's something else happening that I'm not aware of. I come from a family where my brother got his master's but only had half of it paid, and he still has over $60,000 in student debt.

You can keep up to date by [following us on social media](https://vtbreakingsilence.carrd.co/) or following [the GPSS on Twitter](https://twitter.com/VTGPSS). We created BreakingSilence@VT to speak out about issues impacting everyone on campus - faculty, staff, and students. Also, apparently the university's top administrative leaders unironically use Twitter to make their decisions. No we're not joking. Several of us and many of the people we work with have said that university administrators (including the Board of Visitors) will frequently quote Tweets in official meetings when talking about student and even faculty/staff opinions. So genuinely the best thing you can do (for now at least) is Tweet at Virginia Tech and Tim Sands in support or retweet what we and others post about shit like this. But especially, please talk to the grad students in your life and let them know they have your support. Part of how we overcome this is by helping and serving those around us.

comment,Grad students are some of the best people at this university and they are being mocked and derided by the university,"I love SMBC but that's way off. Publishing is not suppsoed to be your sole duty. The idea was that a prof should teach, and mentor / advise older (grad) students, and do some research, and do some extension work, and publish the results of all of this. Publish or perish means that all that other shit is totally irrelevant, the only thing that matters is pumping out pubs (even if they're mediocre pubs). This leads to a lot of bad behavior. P-hack if you must, salami slice your work, ~~steal~~ borrow other people's ideas from conferences if you can beat them to publication. Bully your way onto the papers of lesser faculty members, include your friends as authors as long as they return the favor... none of this will hurt you as long as you get pubs. It doesn't even matter if the paper actually contributes anything to the world, it just matters that it's on your resume. And lol at teaching, if you suck at teaching, nobody cares. Shit, if you're abusive or even sexually harass students, most universities will sweep that under the rug if you're bringing money and pushing out pubs. On the other hand if you're fantastic at teaching and a great adviser, and contribute to the state, but don't have as many pubs, fuck you. I'd argue that someone who is great at the ""publish or perish"" game is probably a pretty bad professor, but not according to the tenure and promotion committee.",2022-02-25 15:20:16,15

comment,Found and scanned some pictures from my mom's graduation in 82. Thought this sub would appreciate.,"Some of them don’t actually exist anymore. At least the second one with the sign/map is long gone. It was taken on the old Southgate where you used to come in off of 460. Not sure when you were at tech/if you’re there now, so you might already know, but for those who don’t, the exit off of 460 was only built in 2018. Southgate used to keep going straight through the duckpond drive traffic circle and eventually ended at a stoplight where you could get on and off of 460. In that picture, you’re looking as if you’re coming on to campus off to the right side of the road, and the old dairy barns (now displaced by the airport expansion and the new Southgate Dr) are in the background. Probably a really confusing explanation but if you look at google maps you can see what I mean. And if you get on 460 west off of Southgate Dr, and keep an eye out to your right, you can see where the intersection used to be (there’s a gate and a big clearing).",2021-07-06 08:29:05,14

It wasn’t until VT Football really got rolling that they built the highway (imagine all the football traffic coming in to town from South Main St. Yikes.) not sure where Southgate ended up back then.

Thought this sub would appreciate.,"We made Lane loud, then we added structures to keep it loud, e.g. the South End Zone stands. The conventional bleachers that existed in front of the SEZ scoreboard were torn down and a new bleacher section established on the North, along with a shiny new scoreboard complete with fancy shiny new Jumbotron. Then they built the imposing tower that is the South End Zone. Then the expanded the press box end-to end. I got to be there for all of it, enrolling shortly after the 2-8-1 season, and finally leaving after the 11-0 ""Perfect Season"" It was wild seeing a veritable unknown* and ""quiet"" school become a Football School. As a freshman lots of students were wearing the gear of other schools (I distinctly remember seeing a fair bit of UNC and Tennessee hats/sweat shirts etc).

The interchange was sorely needed and the diverging diamond works well (except for the awful off ramp from 460 eastbound, with the too-tight curve onto the overpass). Old Southgate was a straight-arrow road from Beamer Way to the bypass, with a 45 MPH speed limit once past Duck Pond Dr. The new road, apparently for traffic calming, dips and curves and has a (rarely followed) 25 MPH speed limit and two roundabouts. Not sure how it works for football traffic but at times it is quicker to go to the S. Main exit on 460 and double back to get to places on S. Main instead of using what used to be a reasonable shortcut on Southgate.",2021-07-06 09:25:04,7

I don't know the exact year, but it was probably put up around 1990. Yep, there as a stop sign there, and that went as well as you might expect, especially when everyone was leaving campus after 5 PM. Also, West Campus Drive used to run behind Engel Hall, not between Engel and Hillcrest. I remember seeing some maps and aerial photos from the early 1950s (I think they were in the geology library—does that even exist any more?) showing West Campus running through the area where Cheatham Hall is.",2021-07-07 08:28:18,2

We never came in via South Main, always 460 to Southgate. The by pass was built to help with traffic. It was here at least 10 years before the new Southgate interchange. They also wanted to improve the entrance to campus. The old entrance with the cow barns was a real turnoff and hurt with recruiting. The final blow (I think) was when we hiatus the ncaa baseball regional and all you could smell was the cow barns the whole weekend.

The old entrance with the cow barns was a real turnoff and hurt with recruiting. The bypass was built in the late '60s/early '70s as part of a statewide program to improve highways. Many towns had bypasses (the Christiansburg Bypass was an early one, while it wasn't until the late '70s that 460 was four-laned through Giles County). There were at-grade intersections with Southgate (which was extended from Duck Pond Drive at the time), Prices Fork Road (with stop signs at first), and Toms Creek Road (although interchanges were planned for each intersection). Eventually a traffic light was added to Prices Fork Rd. in the mid-70s as the town (mainly Hethwood) expanded across the bypass. The interchange replaced the traffic lights in the late '70s. Toms Creek was next, pushed for after a popular Blacksburg High School student was killed in a traffic accident there. Southgate was last, held up by the town and the CRC. The town wasn't keen on the location of ""new"" Southgate from Tech Center Dr. to Hubbard St., planned to bypass Airport Rd. and those neighborhoods. The CRC folks wanted their own interchange directly into the office park. The eastern changes to Southgate were eventually killed off, the interchange location was a compromise between using the current Southgate location and a CRC interchange -- facilitated by the FAA demanding increased clear zones at the ends of the runway (which was to be extended anyway), which did in the dairy farm complex (solving the problem of ""cow smells"").",2021-07-07 08:27:46,1
comment,Found and scanned some pictures from my mom's graduation in 82. Thought this sub would appreciate.,"The speed limit may have been dropped on Southgate. South Main was 40 or 45, but the town lowered it -- as it has done all over town. The Town of Blacksburg has an aversion to allowing vehicle traffic to flow. It lowered the speed limit on four-lane Patrick Henry from 35 to 25 MPH (mainly due to stupid students who walked out into traffic) and has artificially low limits in other parts of town. The traffic lights on Prices Fork from Plantation Rd. west to Bruin Lane are all tied together as a sync'ed system, but when it works it works against traffic. If you get a red light at Plantation, you will probably get red lights all the way to the town limits (supposedly to collect traffic into blocks to better utilize road capacity). The lights on S. Main from Ellett Rd. to at least Airport Road are supposed to be synchronized, but rarely work that way since side-street traffic gets priority at the lights.",2021-07-07 08:34:14,1

post,"PSA: Fellow CS majors, please please please take a shower","PSA: Fellow CS majors, please please please take a shower This is the only way I can think of expressing this ongoing issue. The horrid stench in my CS classes has genuinely impacted my ability to focus and learn. I wear two masks to class not because of COVID, but to help cover the absolutely disgusting smell of other students. I’m hoping the mask mandate stays, bc I legit may just pass out if I were to come to class without one on. As a CS major who actually takes showers and wears deodorant, I seriously don’t understand how some of you can go weeks without a shower. It baffles me.

Look at what is actually happening on the ground in Ukraine. They’re outgunned and outmanned but putting up a hell of a fight because they have spirit. They’re using posts, signs, camaraderie and every other thing they can to unite their people. And it’s working. Laugh all you want but morale can be just as important as military efficiency. Public pressure and community sentiment goes along way",2022-03-02 13:57:57,8

comment,This man is paid over $4 million dollars a year and is 1-13 in one score games.,Really makes me appreciate Frank Beamer so much more. Even in a bad season Frank coached circles around Pry and Fuente. At least Pry is likable whereas Fuente was a prick. The best schools have offensive minded coaches.

Both coordinators need to go and the OL coach needs to be left on the tarmac. Pry needs to hire a ""Jerry Kill"" to act as an advisor because he coaches scared sometimes and makes boneheaded mistakes. Ballein needs to be escorted out of Merryman and the Whit needs to either take an active role in managing the football team or hire someone from a reputable P2 school who will. Fan engagement will quickly sink back to the end of Fuente's tenure if big measures aren't taken.

Maybe Pry isn’t the guy. Very possible. But 3 years is not enough to judge with what was left to him. People have rose colored glasses to last season, getting this false notion that we were better last year and Pry is regressing. Nah. We got literally every single one of our conference wins versus all five of the worst teams in the ACC. Literally, all five. This year’s schedule with last year’s team, I doubt we crack 3 wins. Last year’s schedule with this team, we’d probably end with 9. We did better against every common opponent we faced, and we’ve been incredibly competitive in games that we would’ve gotten stomped in last year.

comment,A good old meme.,"Unfortunately that's just a standard healthcare question. Most charting programs require that question be asked in order to proceed with the EMR. If you're a female under 65 you'll get asked that at almost every medical exam. There are two main reasons for asking that question. 1) pregnancy can contraindicate many prescriptions and even some medical proceedures. 2) to rule out pregnancy as a cause for symptoms. The follow up question is often are you taking birth control or using other contraceptives. That is to rule out the hormonal influence of the birth control pill or implant. Many patients forget or don't consider birth control to be a medication, so when the provider asks ""do you normally take any medication"", patients leave birth control out.

comment,I rebuilt a chair from Cassel Coliseum with original 1962 parts that were being tossed!,"First and foremost, I want to thank Reddit for bringing awareness to the recent May 2020 renovations that to my knowledge have removed the last of the original 1962 wooden seats in Cassel Coliseum. The reconstruction process came with a few challenges including that there are over 3 different seat widths and to make one seat they all need to be the same. In fact, this is the reason I’m missing the arched number board at the top. Other challenges included finding the right fasteners to securely lock everything in place including the addition of 2 large brackets to support the massive cantilevered force. I was luckily able to find a manufacturer for these brackets, [Archer Seating](https://archerseating.com/product/cassell-coliseum-chair-bracket/) who hooked me up with a fantastic deal on some extra parts he had with a “bad paint job.” All in all, the chair came out to a weight of exactly 50lbs and I’m very pleased with how it turned out! Other news, I am selling individual boards from the back section in a variety of lengths and wood tones. These can be seen in the last photo and from the original vintage seats. I may also have the capacity to sell other parts including seats and brackets in the near future but quantities will be very limited. If anyone has specific questions I’m more than happy to answer them below:",2020-08-12 12:52:48,43

comment,Just answer yes or no,Except they should be able to easily report that it is a double test while still keeping their dashboard up to date with actual numbers of infected student on or off campus. JMU for example does include self-reported students meaning the 500 cases it had that got it shutdown could be the truth in VT as well depending on how many off-campus ones they're ignoring on dashboard. Obviously double counting would be bad but it's just as bad for that VT dashboard to imply there are fewer student cases than is true and I have to imagine there is a way to update that dashboard to keep public informed without misrepresentation to country/state,2020-09-03 18:31:31,14
comment,Just answer yes or no,That’s just factually not true.

comment,Just answer yes or no,"For foreign visitors tested positive upon arrival, they're traced back to their departing country but still only considered a case in the arrival country. I agree that VT can include another number for self-reported cases as long as they come to campus (otherwise it doesn't make sense) and are not infected for the second time. The infected students can be fully online somewhere else, thus not counted as a case in VT. However I'm not sure when the self-reporting students get tested. They may be already recovered if they were infected months ago.",2020-09-04 01:17:52,1

post,Please consider donating,"Please consider donating On October 21, 2024, Cadi was riding her motorcycle to class, at Virginia Tech, when she approached an intersection on campus. However, an oncoming driver allegedly failed to yield on their yellow left turn, crossing into Cadi's path. With little to no time to react, Cadi and her motorcycle collided with the driver's SUV. Cadi was ejected from her motorcycle, landing on the other side of the SUV before quickly losing consciousness. As MedFlight was unable to respond fast enough, Cadi was rushed to LewisGale Montgomery Hospital via ambulance. Due to the critical nature of her injuries, she was then airlifted to Carilion Roanoke Memorial Hospital, a Level 1 Trauma Center. Things will be very difficult for Cadi and her family for an extended period. Health insurance will cover some, but not all, of her medical expenses, which are anticipated to be very high. In addition to medical expenses, her family will incur many other costs to rearrange their lives around her recovery, such as time off from work, travel, lodging, etc. We are also expecting added tuition costs from extending her academic career. Any donations will go toward assisting the family and Cadi as she recovers and adjusts to her changed life.",2024-10-28 16:02:39,484

comment,Ut Prosim,"Don’t have enough spoons to write more about this today other than to say I think it’s a shame that NCB isn’t Librescu Hall by now, even if it would cause those of us that are still here some distress. I avoid the NW side of The Drillfield as much as I can because of what it still does to my day, but the memorial isn’t for me. I know that. Also, the 23rd student was Minu Pinchal. Let’s not forget her just because she practiced Ut Prosim in a different way: https://www.remembrance.vt.edu/biographies/panchal.html",2021-01-23 15:47:22,63
comment,Ut Prosim,"I cannot stress this enough, UT prosim doesn't even do this man justice. It is respectful but a man like this is leagues better than the best hokie. Not just a good hokie but a brave individual.",2021-01-25 07:16:30,2
comment,Ut Prosim,"We petitioned to have New Cadet Hall named LaPorte Hall, but they told us to kick rocks. It's a money matter, not a matter of doing something incredible. Inb4 they let people name it after themselves so that people donate to the university. The university got the money for Femoyer, Thomas, Monteith, and Major Williams Hall, didn't they?",2021-01-23 16:53:51,18
comment,Ut Prosim,"Agreed. Also nice name. Have you ever ut prosimed... have you ever ut prosimed *on weeeed*? Sadly the university is wary of even reminding people of the tragedy. Dr. Librescu absolutally deserves a named building, far more than some rich guy who gave a donation.",2021-01-23 16:19:44,14
comment,Ut Prosim,"He was cool guy. I had him for Dynamics back in like '02 or '03. I fucked around and kept screwing up school, so it took me many extra years to graduate. I remember seeing him in the hall years after I had taken his class. He remembered me and picked me out of the crowd to chat and see how I was doing. He remembered the plans I had for post-graduation life that I must have mentioned in passing and was legit concerned about me. He gave me some strong encouragement, telling me it wasn't too late at all, to just keep going and I'd get there eventually. How the fuck did he remember so much about some random student from a class he taught years earlier? I guess he just cared... I still had friends in ESM when the shooting happened. I remember that night they passed around an email to faculty saying that two profs were unaccounted for. They didn't come out and say what had happened to either, but Drs. Librescu and Granata were listed as status unknown. The second I heard that I knew Librescu had died doing something heroic, I fucking knew it. RIP. (Granata did too, he left the safety of the 3rd floor to try and pull injured students to safety - the shooter never stepped foot on the 3rd floor).",2021-01-23 16:37:54,19
comment,Ut Prosim,"Marlena was a saint. She had such a capacity for empathy and thoughtfulness. A mother to every Hokie that came looking for the hug they didn’t even know they needed. I never met anyone that knew them both that didn’t consider them a single entity. If every spouse aspired to be just half the partner those two were for each other, we’d all live happily ever after.",2021-01-23 16:47:50,7
comment,Ut Prosim,"That’s not really how the UCTC works though. The university will let you fund a building, sure, but the committee’s vetting process to name it is more stringent than what candidates for national office go through. Especially now that Barringer and Lee have been renamed. One single objection can kill a name. Even naming Chem-Phys after President Hahn took four years despite his name being on the building next door for the previous 15. Most agree they simply gave up trying to pass a new name and combined the two buildings instead.",2021-01-23 17:13:23,4
comment,Ut Prosim,"It isn’t called *higher* education for nothing. EDIT: I’m out of town, please hit me up next week.",2021-01-23 16:30:46,9
comment,Ut Prosim,"Agreed. It makes my blood boil that the school refuses to name buildings so they can use them as bait for mega donations instead of naming them after people who deserve it. People who inspire us, and who's names need not be forgotten. People who we should want to be like. NCB should be Librescu Hall and New Cadet Hall should be LaPorte hall. Even if you give them the benefit of the doubt and say they're trying not to remind people of the tragedy, its still a bad look. We shouldn't forget anyway.",2021-01-23 16:49:37,9
comment,Ut Prosim,"He did something very similar for me. I did well in class and on homework, but struggled on the tests. He took me aside and gave me some encouragement, convinced me to try harder. A great man.",2021-01-23 19:30:32,8
comment,Ut Prosim,"Okay but here's the thing. Lee was largely renamed because a small group of people decided to dredge up the history of the man it was named for and REPEATEDLY and LOUDLY trumpeted it to anyone and everyone who would listen, to the point where the university was forced to hasten the naming process. Some of the testing centers and ballrooms have simply been named for the person who paid for them as well. I see absolutely no reason why a person couldn't, for example, campaign for Homecoming Royalty on the message of getting a hall named after Librescu. That might make the issue high profile enough to force the university's hand.",2021-01-23 19:55:49,-8
comment,Ut Prosim,The university administration doesn’t give a first thought about who wins homecoming whatever. That’s just a handful of kids pining after their high school days when their parents come to town.,2021-01-23 20:00:06,8
comment,Ut Prosim,"It was an example. And I guarantee you that *anything* that potentially influences the school's image is going to be on their radar. Look at what happened after that article about SGA went out. Reorganization task force is called up immediately, after years of previously attempting and failing to get them to reform SGA.",2021-01-23 20:08:56,-2
comment,Ut Prosim,"The petition /u/YutBrosim mentioned had almost 50k signatures. Again, it’s not that simple. Also, SGA carries about as much weight as homecoming queen. They’re not associated with the administration. Remember that I agree about NCB becoming Librescu Hall, I just know the system better than to believe it will ever happen.",2021-01-23 20:10:31,2
comment,Ut Prosim,"> SGA carries about as much weight as homecoming queen Especially now that they're effectively being formally written out of the governance process, yes. > Remember that I agree about NCB becoming Librescu Hall, I just know the system better than to believe it will ever happen. I agree that it's unlikely, but after everything that has happened in this past year, I simply can't take anything for granted anymore. The unthinkable has been happening almost every day for a year now. I wouldn't say ""never"" about anything anymore.",2021-01-23 20:20:41,-1
comment,Ut Prosim,"SGA never had a seat at the table. The BOV liaisons for undergrad and graduate students sit above them and aren’t always members of SGA. Even before the drama, SGA was just kids playing Model UN: Academia Edition.",2021-01-23 20:42:45,5
comment,Ut Prosim,"There was at least the illusion that they actually did something, at least on the Student Affairs level. No student (even the BOV Liaisons) really have control or say in what the university does at the BOV level.",2021-01-23 21:02:50,0

comment,What does that mean for us?,"The problem is protest are popping up everywhere now. Well it’s a problem for Trump. After the protests at colleges like Columbia last year, they demonized them. Called them illegal. Said the universities were woke. This post from him is no surprise. I can see how they might send ICE agents to scare people. If they follow procedures for a legal protest, it shouldn’t be a problem. Go through the administration and campus police to get a permit. Definitely no camping! I suspect they will say something like for four hours, you can protest outside of Squires or on Henderson Lawn. I would go for the Drill Field, if they would allow it. I would imagine certain areas of campus might be off limits… like the memorials. Call tv stations to tell them you are protest but that would bring some unwanted attention too. They could also go to the town to protest on the edge of campus. The town has guidelines to make it legal. I would dot your i’s and cross your t’s for everyone’s sake. Meet with Blacksburg police. We protested when the Westboro Church came to town. The town gave the protestors certain areas to stand. The church had set up times for where they would be so it all went like clockwork and there were no issues. It was just symbolism for them anyway. I know the locals that are protesting in Christiansburg have met with the police department to make sure what they are doing is legal. They have set times and areas. There was a limit to how many could assemble (at first) but they have resolved this.",2025-03-04 11:32:10,9
comment,What does that mean for us?,Simple: get a permit for your protest. All protests in America are legal so long as you abide by local requirements like not blocking rights of way or being on private property. The government can't expell people from schools lol.,2025-03-04 10:38:26,16

I'll make it simple. illegal protests are violent protests, the American public has a constitutional right to PEACEFULL protest without interfering with police or government officials. anything other than this is an illegal protest which VT does not condone in anyway. The ""free Palestine"" protest turned violent therefore police were called, and students were arrested. do not do this, you have the right to free speech and to make signs and block the sidewalk with whatever thing you believe in no matter how right or wrong you are, but the second you shove me out of the way or make me threatened you will have consequences because that turns violent. this does not impede your right to free speech, this is not ""tyrannical"" this is just saying ""hey if you do the thing you aren't supposed to be doing anyway, you will actually have consequences"" please stop pretending that because something is said by trump that it is bad",2025-03-04 20:07:54,3

If you consider the stakes to be very high (souls, eternity, etc.) then playing a low-percentage game like this isn't so unreasonable. Also, regarding funding: (1) I don't think this effort is funded locally and (2) churches with a lot of professors and other professionals are funded pretty well. This might sound lame, but you should just ask your questions to these guys. They are there because they care for you (albeit maybe not in a way that you agree with) and they want to talk to you.

comment,VMI and Virginia Tech cadets welcoming Queen Elizabeth II at the VA Capitol Building in 2007,"Oh, I remember that day, it was one of the worst traffic jams I have ever been stuck in. They completely shut down I-64 for her motorcade to drive from Richmond to Williamsburg. I, am a descendant of a revolutionary soldier who was at Valley Forge with George Washington and my coworker who was in the car with me that day is a descendant of Benjamin Harrison V who signed the Declaration of Independence. We asked someone what was the cause of the massive traffic backup, (assuming there was a huge crash) and they said: ""Oh haven't you heard the queen of England is in town."" My coworker turned to me and said: ""Damn, I thought our ancestors got rid of them back in 1776."" LOL",2022-09-09 14:15:08,6

comment,VMI and Virginia Tech cadets welcoming Queen Elizabeth II at the VA Capitol Building in 2007,">queen of England Did you mean the [Queen of the United Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_of_the_United_Kingdom), the [Queen of Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy_of_Canada), the [Queen of Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy_of_Australia), etc? The last Queen of England was [Queen Anne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne,_Queen_of_Great_Britain) who, with the 1707 Acts of Union, dissolved the title of King/Queen of England. ####FAQ *Isn't she still also the Queen of England?* This is only as correct as calling her the Queen of London or Queen of Hull; she is the Queen of the place that these places are in, but the title doesn't exist. *Is this bot monarchist?* No, just pedantic.

That's what happens to me the majority of the time when drivers get pissy about me being in the left lane.

comment,"For all you numbnuts driving home in the next couple days, please review this image","True. But this doesn't give anyone license to cruise in the left lane just because they're going faster than the occasional person they pass in the right. Once you've passed whoever you need to pass, move back to the right. Left lane isn't for cruising. That rule applies whether you're going slower than others in the left lane or faster than those in the right.",2022-11-15 14:10:10,0

comment,"For all you numbnuts driving home in the next couple days, please review this image","Lots of travel between B'burg and Florida -- in addition to tailgaters the annoyance comes from drivers who micropass in the left lane (including and especially tractor trailers), stacking up traffic behind them.

You can't tell from the photo that the indicated vehicle is doing anything wrong. If the driver is *actively passing* in the left, in fact, they are using it correctly. What's even funnier is that, based on the line spacing, this is clearly an exit where the left lane exits one way, and the right the other.

comment,Pry relieved effective immediately. Philip Montgomery to serve in interim,"It’s a combo of what you mentioned really plus much more. Pry was weak to recruit in Virginia and missed out on lots of good athletes due to those poor tactics. He made no changes to the bad play calling that Fuente utilized during his time and didn’t improve anything about the team. The players are not playing well, but if they’re following what their coaches tell them to do, that’s not on them. They can only work with what they’re given. There are players that are bad. Drones has proven he’s not fit as a starting quarterback, but Pry’s resistance to benching him is another reason he has to go. A coach, like any good leader, is responsible for those that fall under him. If they’re underperforming, it’s an indictment on his skills as a coach. Going 0-3 in the opening trio of games is something not even Fuente did. We haven’t seen that since 1987. All in all, Pry was a stale addition to the program, and in his inability to make any improvement, actively made the team worse.",2025-09-14 15:41:44,6

comment,"""I'm sorry, $300 more a month just isn't doable for us"" says the guy who makes $52,000 a month","There's significant bloat in AP Faculty pay, but focusing on this top level might not be the best strategy. Arguably those salaries are all market driven, and many of those listed bring in more money to the university than they take out, either through fundraising or grants. For example, #85 on the top 100 paid at VT in 2021 is the head of government relations at $277k. What other state-supported entity in Virginia pays their head lobbyist $277k? \#100 is the VP for communications at $266k. What other state-supported entity in Virginia pays their head of communications $266k? VP for Finance comes in at #45 at $333k. What other state-supported entity in Virginia pays their head of finance $333k? And that's just the top 100. For reference, the Governor of Virginia makes $175,000. But he's political. Operationally, the head of Virginia's Department of Corrections (a massive, billion dollar enterprise operation), makes $203k. The head of Virginia's Department of Health during the pandemic--a medical doctor--made $231k. You want to find the money? It's there.

A $20,000 raises to these 10 administrators cost the same as giving every graduate student an extra $2.35 a month. Virginia Tech decided it gets more value giving raises to faculty than to graduate students. Why should Virginia Tech give the money to graduate students instead of full time faculty?

This is more of a VA-state govt issue in regards to (1) state worker (and NIH) pay bands being suppressed, despite inflation (2) ability for state employees and others to effectively unionize and negotiate better pay (3) if they raise graduate student stipends to reflect inflation, then they need to do this as well for all staff with degrees making under the minimum faculty salary. In summary, everyone is currently getting screwed (students & staff) except for the highest earners among the faculty & admin. Athletic coaches aren't exactly hurting either, salary wise...they could endure some cuts and be just fine. How do you change this? Not sure. Forcing out & retiring all of the boomer faculty/admin who are completely out of touch with reality is a start though.

comment,"""I'm sorry, $300 more a month just isn't doable for us"" says the guy who makes $52,000 a month","He gets paid that much because he fundraises a ton of money for the university. The university will always pay up to keep faculty who make tech money. Graduate students are an expense to the university. While they do participate in research and teach intro classes, tech knows they are a dime a dozen, while faculty that can bring in millions of dollars a year are much harder to find. Edit: A better way to put it might be graduate students are replaceable, while he isn't. Tech is a top-tier research institution because people like Phelgar bring in grant money for the university. While graduate students might help with the research, the money is given to tech because of the faculty members' efforts. If you were to fire every graduate student and replace them with new ones, the amount of grant money tech receives wouldn't be affected. However, if you remove the fundraisers like Phelgar, you end up with less money. Tech has no incentive to raise the pay of graduate students and every incentive to raise the pay of the fundraisers for precisely this reason.

comment,"""I'm sorry, $300 more a month just isn't doable for us"" says the guy who makes $52,000 a month","Here's a radical idea: The cost of moving all grad students to a minimum $2,400 stipend is about $2.5 million. All state employees will be receiving a 5% salary increase this year; potentially a 7% increase, depending on how the budget ends up. Most employees at VT are university employees; only a few are still state employees (going back to changes made in the early 2000's). Nevertheless, as a rule of thumb, whenever the state puts in a salary increase for state employees, the university follows with an increase for all employees. But if the university did not give that 5% increase to all employees making $250,000 or more, the cost savings would be around $2 million. . .about 80% of what's needed for the $2,400 12-month stipend. (fact check me--the top 100 earners made a combined total of $35.2 million in 2021, prior to a 5% increase last year. A 5% increase on that $35.2 million is $1.76 million. The lowest of the top 100 earners made $266k, so you'd also factor in those making between $250k and $266k). &#x200B; So take it a step further. Get a list from the university of everyone who makes over $250k. Approach each one. Ask them to personally sign on to the plan. It's not costing them anything they already have, only a future 5% increase to their salaries of a quarter million dollars or more. I imagine most university admins lean left of center and have personal beliefs about equity and a certain amount of wealth redistribution--see if they'll personally back up their beliefs by forgoing 5% added to their 250k+ salaries.

The only thing you can do is to strike and make them pay your worth. I understand everyone is upset, we expect fair pay and fair distribution from a NON PROFIT TAX FUNDED UNIVERSITY. The non-logical fight from admin to suppress this actively shows they know what they are doing. If it wasn't a big deal then they would just let people go and fill the spots with new people.

Also by saying grad students are replaceable you have absolutely zero experience in training new grads so they can work efficiently to finish the proposal on time so they can secure the fund source for years. There are many labs where the students know much more than their professors, and this is the very reason why professors can focus on managing labs and projects. You can downvote me all you want, it doesn't change the fact that you have little mind to appreciate grad students' roles in bringing funding to tech, and only make yourself look bad by doing things like this",2023-03-13 03:30:45,20

Second, the reason they do these things is **because** they lack a great deal of leverage. Grad employees have one thing they can leverage in negotiations and it’s their labor. As someone who helped to lead a graduate union through a labor stoppage let me tell you it’s a hard fight. We all understand there is a logic to the cruelty but the point is that’s it’s cruel. People who labor deserve not to subsist on scraps. Though I suppose some people do get by on shoe leather.",2023-03-13 09:45:46,7
comment,"""I'm sorry, $300 more a month just isn't doable for us"" says the guy who makes $52,000 a month","lol u/HoundCiS has it right. You clearly have no idea what the fuck you're talking about. A PhD student in my lab wrote the entire proposal that will be split among 3 professor's labs. They just signed off on it. I have written the bulk of two proposals worth 325k that just needed a go over. Three other PhD candidates in my lab are writing proposals. Most professors who are not early career are not writing their own proposals unless they've mismanaged their labs. Beyond that, many labs have half a dozen projects going on. You seriously think that it's the professors that are doing the research on all of these projects? Fuck no. Go look at their publications and see how many they're first author on versus how many their grad students are first authors on if you want a breakdown of who is actually doing the work. A PhD student who graduates is by definition considered an expert once they receive their doctorate, and a requirement of graduating is to have pushed the field into areas previously unexplored. Do you think that any one professor has the same breadth of knowledge as the possibly dozen or more of their PhD candidates, each with their own specific niche? Without all these different research thrusts, there are no grants. And no, you absolutely cannot just replace every single graduate student. Go ask any professor and see if they would be okay with replacing their entire fucking lab group. Unless they're a shit lab manager who created a dysfunctional lab environment, not a single one would be willing to do that. Institutional knowledge is a thing and gets passed down among lab members. Cohesive, supportive environments are not created overnight and are not so easily replicated. Only a fool who seriously think they can just purge their entire workforce without serious consequences to productivity and quality. People have been saying the same shit for forever about ""nonessential workers"" then been bitten in the ass when those nonessential workers aren't available.",2023-03-14 14:39:25,2

comment,"""I'm sorry, $300 more a month just isn't doable for us"" says the guy who makes $52,000 a month","The issue with your calculation for how much we make has been discussed at length in other threads, but it's worth reiterating. We can't live off of tuition remission and, at a certain point, it's just the university paying itself (e.g. grad students don't take classes in the last few years of our degree). I've also had yet to meet a grad student that actually is able to keep their hours to 20/week, it's usually more like 40-60, and we are prohibited from having outside employment (even if we did have time). Staff and other student workers absolutely deserve to be paid more. This was something that grad students on the living wage task force and across the university brought up specifically and repeatedly. This is not an ""us or them"" issue, it's systemic across all levels of the university and it's reductive to turn it into pitting groups of underserved workers against each other.",2023-03-13 10:54:20,16

It's a matter of those that make a living wage getting more, improper spending, and leaving those struggling without any recourse.

comment,"""I'm sorry, $300 more a month just isn't doable for us"" says the guy who makes $52,000 a month","Seconding that AP faculty bloat. And if it hasn't been mentioned--- most faculty do not get the 5% salary increase. The university skims off a decent amount so they can give ""merit raises,"" and then what remains is given to faculty based on how your department has ranked you. In the past 8 years every time a ""5% salary increase"" was approved by the state I have seen between 2.25% and 4% max, even if I was ranked extremely high in my department, and that raise was labeled a ""merit raise."" So while the state approves 5%, it doesn't mean all your faculty will actually get 5%. And you have a whole tier of faculty, full-time instructors, who frequently make below $50,000, a number are below $45,000. I'm curious if the higher paid AP faculty brackets more consistently get the actual state-approved raise, given the skimming from everyone.",2023-03-16 16:05:42,3

comment,"""I'm sorry, $300 more a month just isn't doable for us"" says the guy who makes $52,000 a month","And a lot of grad students also teach a LOT depending on their department. They and instructor ranks should be natural allies, given instructors frequently have higher student credit hour ratios the TT faculty, yet are grossly underpaid by comparison. Look up the BOV approved salaries for faculty for 2021-2022 and then 2022-2023--- you can see how many instructor rank make only the base pay for instructors (which I believe is still $43,500, but check BOV's minutes to see the approved faculty compensation plan). You'll see a major jump in salaries between 2021-2022 and 2022-2023 in department of English after a massive push by instructors based on the fact they taught a significant majority of the student credit hours in the department yet made far under their TT counterparts. In 2021-2022 24/24 instructors made under $46,500 and their Advanced Instructors (those who had to have been employed at least 5 years full time and then evaluated for potential promotion) made from $47,000 - $50,000. After their push, their instructor rank's base salary was bumped to $50,000 and Advanced to $55,000. Now, Mathematics instructors got wind and want to push for their own increase given they're in a very similar situation (teaching the majority of student credit hours but almost all paid close to that low-end base pay for each instructor rank). I would bet the university does not want instructors and GTAs talking and would rather they were fighting--- they're natural allies given without their work keeps departments afloat.",2023-03-16 16:22:15,1

comment,Time to start attending classes in Minecraft (Album in comments),"Depends on what you mean by 1:1 scale. If you assume one block is 1m^2 and the 12,000,000 x 12,000,000 is just surface blocks, then yes. The surface area of Earth is 196.9 million mi^2 (according to Google). (12e6)^2 = 1.44e14 surface blocks. Converting to miles: 1.44e14 / 0.000621371 ≈ 8.9477e10 mi^2 . All with 89 billion blocks to spare! Edit: Mixed up meters and miles in my explanation. Too many units...",2020-07-13 16:13:45,2
comment,Time to start attending classes in Minecraft (Album in comments),A group made a modpack for 1:1 mapping the Earth into a single world. That's what we're using to get the terrain and outlines. Here's a video on the project [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8\_bW3ab8YAk&t=513s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_bW3ab8YAk&t=513s),2020-07-14 11:27:38,1
comment,Time to start attending classes in Minecraft (Album in comments),"I am too lazy to do the math, but you did pique my curiosity enough to google the surface area of the earth in square meters and it comes up in the 500 trillion~ish range. The farlands being roughly 12 and a half million blocks out, I really don’t think it’s possible to make a 1:1. HOWEVER, I just googled and the farlands is a bedrock edition only thing, so I suppose it’s irrelevant",2020-07-13 16:19:01,3
comment,Time to start attending classes in Minecraft (Album in comments),"The large surface area comes into play since surface area grows exponentially in relation to side lengths of squares and radii of spheres. The actual math does get kinda weird since the surface of spheres are non euclidean space, but locally euclidean geometry works well enough. Looking a little deeper, I think my math works for flat square Earth but not for spheres since sqrt(500,000,000,000,000) would give roughly a 22,000,000 x 22,000,000 square. You've also really piqued my interest so now I'm going to do the only logical thing. Spend the rest of my day trying to figure out if you can build a 1:1 scale of Earth in Minecraft.",2020-07-13 16:33:39,2

comment,Time to start attending classes in Minecraft (Album in comments),Well since farlands aren’t an issue in the Java version I would assume the minecraft world is infinite in that version but I’m not sure.,2020-07-13 17:34:23,1

comment,Palestine encampment protest in front of the GLC,"hi everyone! this is gonna be long, but here’s some information: the demands for virginia tech administration are 1. Divest from Israel and provide endowment transparency, 2. Issue an official statement condemning Israel’s violence against Palestine and the genocidal loss of life, and 3. Define anti-Palestinian racism and acknowledge the suppression of Palestinian and allied students on campus. for those asking “why tents on a lawn,” the reason this was at the GLC and not the drillfield was to ensure the encampment would not be taken down as soon as it was erected. plus this design of protest is specifically organized to show solidarity with the thousands of palestinians who have been displaced into tent communities and lack safe and consistent access to basic necessities like food and water. for those asking “why virginia tech,” it is proven that nearly every drone used in gaza has a piece of VT hardware or software, VT has a close partnership with VIAB and therefore receives lots of funding from Israeli businesses/coalitions (thus proving significant bias), and VT has released statements supporting Israeli students (such as lighting burruss up in israel’s flag colors and promising to “always stand with israel”) yet has failed to reference or support its Palestinian students in any manner. additionally, the virginia tech foundation (as a 501c3 nonprofit) is NOT required to share where donations/endowment money goes, so although we know it sends funds to DoD, Boeing, Northrop, etc. we have no idea what %. also, for those saying this is just to look like martyrs/because other universities did it so VT students thought to join in, no dawg. VT has been peacefully protesting for palestine since october. this is nothing new, just a new escalation. also, yes, obviously, students have classes and finals - no one was trapped there. many people left for class and came back, did homework/studied at the camp, etc. because THIS is what the students care about. THIS is bigger than a finals season. lastly, stop spreading false rhetoric about these protests - there are no “death to israel” signs or anything antisemetic as part of the pro-palestinian group at VT, and if you claim there were, i’m sure i and everyone else would love to see the proof that doesn’t exist. anywho thanks for reading, free palestine 🇵🇸🍉",2024-04-26 21:32:31,22

comment,Palestine encampment protest in front of the GLC,"Not surprised with the people here in the comments, no mention of Hamas instigating the war with October 7th kidnappings, OR Joe Biden giving Iran back access to money so they can fund not just the Red Sea Houthi terrorists but also Hamas. And who's suffering? Innocent civilians on both sides. Palestine was the name of an area of desert which was never an independent country but always under the control of empires/kingdoms/states (Persian, Macedonian, Phoenician, Roman, Egyptian, multiple different emirates/sultanates, crusader states LIKE THE KINGDOM OF JERUSALEM, etc.). So what did Israel do after they took what was a barren desert with no permanent settlements to create a civilization with infrastructure, give some of the land to the Arabic tribes that were there just so they could have it backfire. But hey, who am I to say the facts to people who don't think about the facts and are just going to start REEEEEING, down vote this, and type some short small sentence without any facts or basis like ""that's not true because (just) X (not Y and/or Z)"" or ""you don't know what your talking about"".

Then a few days later a girl comes and does the same thing although this time I answer and she says wrong address but started to look around my place. Today the same guy comes back and does the same thing but my bf answers and he goes “sorry, I thought this was my place”. ALL WHILE LOOKING AROUND MY APT.

comment,I can't be the only person who's experienced this rollercoaster of emotions,"Thank T. Marshall Hahn. He built the school we know today. When he came to VPI it was almost entirely undergrad only, it was almost all engineering and agriculture with some applied sciences, and IIRC all males had to serve two years in the corps. This was before Pamplin even existed (formed during Hahn's tenure), and the Vet School wouldn't appear until 1978. His dream was to make it a ""comprehensive university"" rather than polytechnic, and to add a large graduate school. He also wanted to become a flagship campus of a multi-campus system absorbing VSU in Petersburg (the other land grant) and adding new campuses in rural areas. The new institution would be called Virginia State University, and mainly be modeled after Penn State and Ohio State. The Virginia General Assembly refused to allow this. A lot of UVA grads in the field who didn't like the idea of VT getting a large graduate school and becoming another flagship school. So they refused to allow the merger with VSU Petersburg.

comment,Please listen. Stay home.,"This is from a Facebook post made on Monday the 16th. I am not aquatinted with the original poster but I found this to sound accurate based on her other comments. The numbers of tests have changed since then but not greatly. “Okay, so I just made some calls because I was pretty curious about testing in our region. Here is what transpired. In each call, I asked, ""if someone in my family has symptoms of coronavirus, can you test for it?"" 1. Called Carilion Family Practice. Answer: ""We can't do that."" Me: ""Where do we go, then?"" Answer: ""I honestly don't know. Maybe you should just stay home, since there is no treatment for it."" 2. Called MedExpress. Answer: ""We are referring people to the ER. We don't have the test kits here."" Question: ""Does the ER have the kits?"" Answer: ""I'm not sure, but we are referring people there."" 3. Called New River Health District (phone number is very hard to find on the VA Dept of Health Web Page). Answer: ""The ER can test for it, but they will only do so with a doctor's referral."" Question: ""So, I need to go to two medical facilities and potentially expose everyone at both?"" Answer: ""Our health department nursing staff might be able to refer you. Let me forward you."" ... call was dropped... Okay -- last installment. I finally got through to the VA Dept of Health. I asked about testing availability. She said, ""what part of the state?"" I said, ""Blacksburg, where Virginia Tech is"". She said, ""ohhhh... yeah, we don't have testing in that region at this time"". She then proceeded to tell me that we could go to the ER, but the ER would probably not be able to test without getting in touch with the VA Health Dept. She said, ""LabCorp should be able to test later this week, so maybe some of your healthcare facilities can test in a week or so"" Virginia has tested 489 people as of today [03/16/20], in a state of 8.5 M people. Something is very, very wrong and we should be rising up to demand answers!”",2020-03-18 13:52:46,3
comment,Please listen. Stay home.,"This subreddit is a fucking hivemind. Respect on expressing your opinion and backing it up with facts. Anything that isn't typed by a soft, chubby 102 IQ redditor here will be downvoted. The raw truth is that we paid tuition and we're paying rent; to pay this enormous some to have to take classes and be at home is an enormous front on whatever it even means to have a college education. Moreover, it's also a Professor's duty to protect himself or herself; this idea of ""we can't go outside because an old person might get it"" is healing this massive social responsibility onto the young. Social distancing should be practiced, for sure, and the elderly should be protected, for sure - at the same time, if Johnny decides he wants to grab a pizza or go to the gym, it's not his duty to protect Lisa the 60 year old accountant. Lisa also has to stay at home, protect herself, order groceries from online, etc. We can't expect Johnny to avoid all contact with everyone and move home forever - there's a responsibility for both parties here!",2020-03-18 13:31:04,-11

comment,Please listen. Stay home.,"It appears that the state health officials overstated how prepared they were, that being said, I feel like the post you mentioned might have had a different response if they had went through their insurer or said they were exhibiting symptoms. I understand that there are some people who are asymptomatic, but among the people who are exhibiting symptoms few of the tests come back positive. If by chance you do end up exhibiting symptoms its a matter of isolating yourself for a couple of days and treating it as you would a cold. I get why people are choosing to stay home, but if you plan on social distancing it shouldn't make a difference where.",2020-03-18 14:55:55,1

We're from the Memphis area, but I will say that we are falling in love with the Blacksburg area. https://preview.redd.it/e0144e57ncxb1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=181ee9cdd3a99619f70cdf862ba61d2df9b7cdd2 https://preview.redd.it/uninub87ncxb1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=216f10d643020fa92d3bccf10ed85f958ab30bdd https://preview.redd.it/fg5mw397ncxb1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0446994a9961b7c7abfcfd00c0d1e2876c5ab28b https://preview.redd.it/x3hi4t27ncxb1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=97c8bcb763babf37a5fe16732da5cc7a9feff508 https://preview.redd.it/v1wcq737ncxb1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ed44c02511615f600ed645b48e401b1ee6f2de48 https://preview.redd.it/5ayjg667ncxb1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f0f411062a590061acd93e57694040c819ff0a87 https://preview.redd.it/ztfv9d27ncxb1.jpg?width=1816&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=76e2d5db9e976efe0d409ad94edfc6c88d41fd7f https://preview.redd.it/5s1n0797ncxb1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f58b3a5098c834168910c9ec732185a24f8f78d0 https://preview.redd.it/5ucct7a7ncxb1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0ed38aac8b6b150ca4684e31208468e80ae4ee48 https://preview.redd.it/3c6v9v47ncxb1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c3d89c04eb71d45ff6e60da7add178317cc7eb5a https://preview.redd.it/or8kjd67ncxb1.jpg?width=1816&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=aaeaaeade5479ad1651d755ab155a07bde5fcab8 https://preview.redd.it/i2eaqk57ncxb1.jpg?width=1816&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=da52b164f48527d2d604a90ea085d30485e3970e https://preview.redd.it/s0f71e97ncxb1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a5b8831516f2cc07f3312c48f79cb16e36c4e122 https://preview.redd.it/uzhy6067ncxb1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3e53d0c96a4ab29c5da818b17c58a596e7feaddc",2023-10-30 10:22:06,424

Of course he rolls his eyes at the BS (both me and his mother are ex-USAF, so at least we have been able to provide some wisdom into the tactics of military training), but he doesn't hate it. Our biggest message is for him to remember that none of the yelling and punishments/revoking of privileges is personal...it's just part of the process. He's there on a full-ride USAF ROTC scholarship so he really can't quit, but he chose the Corps of Cadets and VT over every other school with a USAF ROTC program knowing full well that it would be challenging. I honestly think that's what he wanted: The challenge. And now that he's in White Phase, he still rolls his eyes at the BS, but at least he can left face while dragging in the dorms now, lol. We constantly encourage him and send him positive messages (and boxes of food and other assorted goodies.)",2023-10-30 13:21:31,18

comment,VT be like,Nah. People just act like they’re doing it to intentionally hurt students. Was more meaning this is a circumstance of trying to do the most with a terrible situation. Have to do random 5 days because of things like labs because if you miss 5 mondays or fridays you’re missing like 5 weeks of some classes etc,2020-10-19 21:25:10,21

comment,VT be like,"Every student who is willing to travel during a pandemic is going to do so regardless of a scheduled break or not, seeing as classes can be attended virtually from anywhere at the moment. Guarantee we’ll see plenty attending classes from a beach for a week during spring. And additionally, why the hell are half the days in the middle of the week? At LEAST make them on fridays so we get a long weekend. There’s ZERO reason to make those days in the middle of the fucking week. So no matter how you slice it, it’s stupid. Furthermore, and this is a personal reason, I need my spring break to help with spring harvest on my family’s farm. If I don’t we stand to lose the whole place, and thus I’d have to drop out of college. So again, stupid decision from every angle.",2020-10-19 22:53:07,12

comment,Zoom University Meme #479,"It's complicated, and half the time I think you need to look at the assessment as being garbage. Making exams is hard and most profs aren't trained for it. They just cobble something together the night before they administer it. Most of the time in industry, you can Google stuff and experiment and get advice from others. When students can achieve things with help, that isn't necessarily a bad thing. The problem with cheating is when you don't really know anything at the end of it and couldn't have solved it without hiring someone else. I guess my take is that my usual job is filtering out the students who truly don't get it after a semester, and otherwise to provide as many opportunities for them to practice and experiment and just put in hours with the material. Lotta evidence seems to suggest it takes a long time for people to ""get"" coding, and it's unlikely to land for most people after just a few months of rushed instruction. We need to manage our expectations and recognize that everyone's progressing in their own way and rate. I have more thoughts but I'm tired and haven't finished my project spec. The real story this semester is that as brutal as it is for students, it's been equally brutal for many of us faculty. I've pulled a lot of all nighters and it's still been a terrible learning experience for my students :/",2020-04-21 01:59:38,6

comment,"Been a pry defender, but it’s time for change","Va Tech should offer the head football coaching job to Jimbo Fisher. His record is an amazing 128 & 48. Zero scandals. And he left A&M with $77 Million in his pocket. He is from West Va and loves the ACC. Va Tech boosters have raised $48 Million. If we need more money and office space, I would offer that of Whit Babcock, Tim Sands, Charles Phlegar, and Coach Pry. They have dug a big enough hole putting Va Tech at the bottom of the ACC in revenue even though the fans have packed Lane Stadium for years, and the boosters have done a wonderful job of fund raising. Finally, I would invite the Board of Visitors to visit somewhere else, but not ever in Blacksburg again. Follow this recipe, and I’ll see you at the top! Go Hokies!!!",2025-09-18 02:10:24,1
comment,"Been a pry defender, but it’s time for change",As a taxpayer in Va I’m pissed off. Only Clemson & Fla State have larger college football stadiums in the ACC than Va Tech.

We want Beamer. We don’t change Vt mentality today is the same as it was in 2010 and 2015 and 2025 We didn’t change. Its now been 15 years, VT on the edge of its 2nd National Championship game The 2011 season was the year it all showed on the field 20th-ranked Tigers scored 21 points in the third quarter to beat No. 3 Virginia Tech 38-10 to win their first ACC Championship in 20 years. * Virginia Tech has won seven consecutive games and Clemson has lost two in a row and three of its last four. * Spread: Virginia Tech -7 * Expect turnovers and pressure to be the difference. Clemson has only forced two turnovers in its last four games and none in its last three. Meanwhile, Virginia Tech has committed four turnovers since its last meeting with Clemson and is +7 in those games. Hokies Win If: They get pressure on Boyd and force turnovers. Tigers Win If: The team from the first eight games shows up. >“We’re a championship program and tonight we added to a great tradition,” Clemson Head Coach Dabo Swinney said. * Clemson football team since that game, has won two national championships (2016 and 2018) six ACC championships and appeared in four national championship games and a record-setting 12 consecutive seasons with at least 10 wins and, with additional title appearances in 2015 and 2019.

comment,These green containers are reusable by the way,I was on the dining committee last year and this topic was discussed pretty in depth Basically it came down to the fact that students want this to be an easy to use system and adding any extra steps make lines longer. Dining services had apparently tried something where they worked with a software company or something to keep track of the containers but that ended up failing. So at that point they were like y’all are paying for it so we are gonna let it play out and if it’s unsustainable because of students then they would probably end the program. I think that there is probably something they could do make it better but I agree with their sentiment that at the end of the day it’s our responsibility.,2021-02-04 22:59:39,7

post,"Virginia Tech, the ACC, and Even ODU Should be Furious at ESPN","Virginia Tech, the ACC, and Even ODU Should be Furious at ESPN The game tonight was one of the worst produced broadcasts I’ve ever seen. Microphones were grainy, sound balancing was off, no first down/line of scrimmage overlays, poor camera work, very few instant replays, and just really bad commentating. Just seemingly amateur production quality.

comment,"Virginia Tech, the ACC, and Even ODU Should be Furious at ESPN","Everyone should take advantage of being able to listen to Bill Roth and Mike Burnop. They have been calling VT games since the 1990s IIRC, and you will be hard pressed to get a better take on the game. You won't have to listen to the ESPN crews mispronouncing our players names, and you'll get a healthy dose of VT history and funny stories. And then at the end of the game, you get player/coach interviews. I always mute the TV, and use another device to play audio via Bill/Mike. Yes, it's a pain when the audio doesn't match up exactly with the broadcast, but IMO it's worth the quality commentary.

comment,"Virginia Tech, the ACC, and Even ODU Should be Furious at ESPN","As a side note I know ESPN+ streams NCAA lacrosse, baseball, and softball using the host schools talent (I think the talent is usually the schools Sports Information department.) It’s one of the things I like about college sports seeing the students running cameras and splicing video. In unrelated news most schools have camera crews assigned to their sports teams. At Tech the main camera guy is allowed to go places the rest of the media isn’t. For instance, they accompany the team from locker room to the tunnel to the field on gameday. They are also in the designated player space during games which is forbidden to all other media. Very cool to watch behind the scenes. Va Tech will then go through the pictures and create a series of photographs that they then sell to fans. It’s actually a pretty lucrative money stream.",2024-09-15 08:28:54,3

I didn’t even know there were signs until now, I still don’t know for sure I’m just taking the commenters in this thread at their word. I’ve actually been shooed off the little darker-grey platform by a polite cadet because we had club pictures over there and there is nothing, and I mean nothing that we saw at the time saying that even the platform surrounding the monument was off limits. In fact that’s what I thought the whole point of the platform was, to stand on to view the monument. I know now to never stand on the platform, but only because a cadet had to go out of their way to tell me. I’m glad the monument is there and a culture of respect and reverence has been built around it. But we have children visiting all the time, international parents, high school students, and freshmen; we can’t expect these people to automatically know the history and culture of respect surrounding this monument without telling them. No one is trying to be disrespectful, they just don’t know any better. There should absolutely be a museum-style sign or clearer engravings that signify what can be touched and what cannot be.

comment,I hate college,Depends.... hit or miss. You do have the freedom to find another position if it’s bad but at the same time there’s the luck that the job isn’t too stressful every day to dread it. Especially in government or government contracting (more money usually) its 40 hours standard a week which is a decent balance of work and life. I’m not a fan of working more hours unless you’re paid for it... there’s jobs that’ll underpay your market value and want you to work 50-60 hours a week. Depends on your studies though. Engineering and CS/BIT and IT are in high demand so you have more options.,2021-02-06 04:04:13,9

Underpaid, terrible culture/slave hours. Some tips: Don’t work more than you need to unless you’re being paid by the hour and can bill it. Or you just love the job which is rare. With salary, some employers want to squeeze you a bit more each week for free work. Criticize you for leaving at the end of your hours etc. they want you to stay till 7 vs leaving at 5 avoid those. Sometimes sure during crunch times it’s needed but not every week.

I remember being relieved that I had reached them almost immediately, as cell towers became clogged and calls were unable to get out. I remember feeling utterly helpless and not knowing what to do. I remember basically staying at my friend’s apartment for the next week endlessly watching the news because I lived by myself and did not want to be alone. I remember going to hear Nikki Giovanni and President Bush speak at Cassell Coliseum. I remember the hundreds of news vans populating the drill field, and just wanting them to leave and go away. I remember countless volunteers setting up activities to keep us engaged as one Hokie family, providing distractions or condolences and hugs if we needed it. I remember calling my parents and telling them they had to drive down and see the walls of plywood on the drill field, painted and signed by students, faculty, and community members as a makeshift memorial. I remember my thesis professor asking if we wanted to finish out the rest of the academic year and offering that she would support either decision we made. I remember deciding not to give up, to stay the course, and remain Hokie strong. I remember the solemn speeches at commencement. And, I still remember to never forget. We will prevail.

Well, the owner reached out to me on here and hooked me and my dad up with a free meal today and it was absolutely delicious. He even included a to-go meal for my mother which was so generous. This was a high note to wrap up graduation weekend and a reminder of what I will miss the most about Blacksburg—its incredibly kind, amazing people.

comment,I GOT IN! I’ll see you guys in the fall :),"Congrats to those who got in! For those that didn't. If you are still interested in going to Virginia tech for engineering, I recommend looking into their community college relationships. I went to Virginia Western community college in Roanoke. At the time I went if you got a 3.0 or higher in their general engineering associates program which is all the physics, statics, Dynamics calc 1,2,3, diffy Q, English, chem, and everything else in-between, Virginia tech will high five you through the front door and all 66 credit hours (grade of C or better) will transfer. I went into tech as a junior right into their civil/transportation program (I know it's different now). I also paid $5k total for that degree (also take into account living expenses or whatever applies to you). It's a great option for those that don't get in or those who want to save a CRAP ton of money. Either way best of luck to all!",2021-02-19 18:22:53,52

comment,I GOT IN! I’ll see you guys in the fall :),"Hey dude, congrats on getting in! As a junior in Aero, I can tell you that while it is a challenging major, it's extremely rewarding. Classes in your future like Thermo and Aerodynamics & Compressibility (fluids part 2) can seem scary from a distance, but as long as you take it one semester at a time, you'll be ready to meet each new challenge as it presents itself to you. The material gets harder, but the problems get more interesting at a faster rate than they get more difficult. Oh and pro tip, if you want to do the astronomy minor, start it soon. Trying to pick it up after your sophomore year can be unwieldy. Best of luck!",2021-02-20 10:05:40,3

comment,I GOT IN! I’ll see you guys in the fall :),"Not completely sure that this is what you meant, but 6,675 seats in the class doesn’t mean they only accepted 6,675 students from the roughly 40,000 applications. The class of 2023 stats on the acceptance letter were similar, and the acceptance rate was still around 70%, because they likely accepted more like 25-30,000 students in anticipation of only 6,675 committing (and for 2023 they were very wrong in that estimate lol)",2021-02-19 22:06:26,6

comment,Stolen from Twitter but had to share,"tomato sauce recipe: 4 cans of whole or diced tomatoes (28 oz each can) 1 can of tomato paste (about 6 oz) 12 garlic cloves Salt - maybe 1 tablespoon + 3/4 cup of olive oil - divided A bunch of Basil - if you like 1. Peel and mince garlic 2. Heat 1/2 cup of olive oil and put the garlic in the hot oil. Heat until golden and fragrant - very important - do not overcook and so it turns brown, it becomes very, very bitter. This is the most important step, **do not overcook garlic.** 3. Add can of tomato paste and canned tomatoes. Cook until reduced by 1/4 of volume and thickens. 4. Add salt to taste, remaining 1/4 cup olive oil and chopped basil. thanks for enshitifying reddit all while selling my info. https://github.com/j0be/PowerDeleteSuite",2020-08-04 13:54:48,36

comment,Me driving home on 81,"So awesome to see others used to take the Ironto cuttoff route. Will tell a story you will appreciate... One late Sunday afternoon I was flogging my ‘89 Civic Si back to campus after a heavy rain. I exited one of the tight turns and the road was covered in water...flash flood water. At least three car lengths wide. I had no idea how deep, but would not have been able to stop before hitting it. I dropped a gear and used the old motorcycle adage “when in doubt GAS IT!”. I felt the car drift a little while skimming across it, but made it OK. About crapped my pants after I stopped and looked back at what I had just done. Learned to be more careful after that, but also that the old adage worked. :-)",2020-02-01 17:58:14,2

comment,Me driving home on 81,"There's also 311 -> Blacksburg Rd, but it only shaved time off if you were going somewhere on the north side of town like Pheasant Run. I doubt it saves time anymore though - 81 is wider, 460 has a bypass that shaves off half a million stoplights, and both highways have higher speed limits than they did when I was there; the back road's probably the same as it ever was. Which basically means if you're driving anything sportier than a van you'll be in the car for 10 minutes longer and you'll actually enjoy yourself for the last hour or so of your drive.",2020-02-01 01:02:39,5

comment,My Aerial Photo that VT Posted on all Platforms Today!,Crazy to look at this photo.... I can still trace the little cut- throughs I used to use as a freshman when I had to bike over to my geology lab at 8:00am on Thursday’s. I can barely identify the window I used to sit at in Newman as a sophomore thinking “wow these engineering classes got tougher”. I remember using the book store lot and a quarter off the floor of my mountaineer and then racing to grab chick fil a when I lived off campus and needed something quick. I could stare at this for hours. This photo threw me for a loop and makes me realize how awesome this school was for me and how many memories I have wrapped around those hokie stones.

What the professor explained to me is that it's not feasible for the university to hire professors for the literally *thousands* of students that have to take 1000-level math courses each semester. Hell, it already seems pretty crammed as it is fitting everyone who needs diff eq, multi, linear algebra, etc. As far as I can see, there's no real easy solution. Even taking into account GTAs teaching courses, there's simply too much required man-hours to teach everyone.

comment,Fire Pry and Whit Babcock into the sun,"I’ve become so apathetic (I’m pissed) to this team - actually, no, this “program”. Whit Babcock and the several coaching staff he has trotted out onto the field have continuously worsened the VT football brand. They’ve turned it into a “fools gold” of sorts, where we tout our great traditions and act like this powerful program, when in reality this is not a well-run program. I think we all need to accept that Tech will never take that proverbial “next step” until the university cleans house of the football/athletic department. Yeah we lost to a probably better team, but this loss felt different. We had a lead against a good team, at home, with all the momentum. But everyone and their mother watching the game *knew* that the Hokies will not make adjustments after halftime. They will let whatever happens happen. Simply put, this team does not care, and that comes all the way from the top. I’m sure the players do care, but they have never, since the days of Beamer, been put in the best positions to succeed and that includes things like mentality and toughness, not solely talent. I’m not an athlete, coach, or whatever but I have watched lots of college football (I’m an expert /s) through the years, having been a fan of many other college programs mostly due to family ties. What I do know is that VT does NOT have a good football product. Plus, given the damage to the brand sustained over last decade, it may be several years until we are again. I love Tech, it’s an awesome school and I made my best memories there. Ultimately, football doesn’t matter, but it’s a damn shame that we have to be publicly humiliated like this every Saturday in the fall these past few years. So, to conclude: if the VT football program doesn’t care enough, then why the hell should I? TL;DR: I love Tech, but we SUCK and I’m angy bout it >:(",2025-09-06 23:07:41,61
comment,Fire Pry and Whit Babcock into the sun,"The disheartening thing is how Vandies' coaches went back at the half and disrupted our entire coaching plan. This might be the worst-coached game I have seen in years. It is tough to be a Tech fan, and every year my hope dies lately. Coach Pry needs to be fired immediately. When we hired him, I was reading an article that stated he had a defensive mindset and would easily provide some similarity to Bud; this has not been the case. Our defense is notorious for giving up big plays, and tonight I saw 7, the most I have ever seen in a single game. Sad....",2025-09-06 23:13:06,24

comment,Fire Pry and Whit Babcock into the sun,"The worst thing Whit has done to the program has made the fan base apathetic to these losses. It's no longer about the excitement of potentially winning these games. It's the mental prep we as a fan base and as alumni go through in anticipation of a loss. As a season ticket holder, they locked me in this year with my donation. So the best I can do is sell my tickets (which I have) or just not travel to drive down revenue at the stadium. They upsold us on the experience in the club house with over processed food and free non alcoholic beverages, but I'd gladly give all that up to put a winning team on the field. Feels like I'd be better off setting money on fire at this point. And for someone who made VT football a cornerstone of my life (traveling during the fall for games, centering other activities around a football schedule), I'm now finding myself looking for anything else to do other than watch the game. For my own mental health, because watching the same thing over and over again expecting a different result is pure insanity. Babcock and Pry need to go, and Sands and the BoV need to make an AD hire reflective of the changing landscape in college sports, as well as hire a transformative coach. Not so much an Xs and Os guys, but someone that can shift the program into the modern era. Shane Beamer may not be an Xs and Os guy, but he's created the culture and the fan base is drinking the kool-aid. I'm not saying Shane is the answer (and I doubt he'll come because he's getting paid SEC money and wants his own legacy), but that is what we need to make our program feel like we have a pulse again.

comment,Fire Pry and Whit Babcock into the sun,"There's a point in the fourth quarter where the game is still in reach and there was a four man rush that looked like a twelve man blitz, and Drones was sacked for ten yards. The point it was over. Part of the problem is the NIL and transfer portal. How do you get players to be invested in a program and its fan base when they know, if make enough snaps and plays to make a decent game tape , Win or lose, they can transfer to the next stop the following year, getting paid all the while.

comment,Fire Pry and Whit Babcock into the sun,Unless Tech is willing to invest $$ into the program this is the future. The players need better coaching and conditioning.

I think the TD vandy got after the half was bc our CB got absolutely cooked, but even then there was no safety help. 3rd down defense play calling was also criminal. Babs also needs to lowkey be arrested bc he extended Fuente in like 20-21 when we could’ve hired Shane. I’m also getting tired of this program just tarnishing the Beamer legacy every gameday.

The only thing impressive about UCF is that they didn’t happen to lose a game. But they’re schedule was a complete joke — week after week against teams that have never seen a 5 star recruit.

comment,I love the CS department :),"You misunderstand. I'm talking about WebCAT and the other various course sites. The course work that is outdated is the heavy bend towards making Computer Science a double major, or supplementary to other engineering majors. There's a heavy focus on Computer Engineering knowledge that is nearly useless to someone who wants to work purely within the realm of computer software development. It's evident in the relatively low credit count for an engineering major, as well as the heavy overlap between ECE and CS required courses. Most other schools offer CS outside of their engineering program for individuals looking for an education that is heavy in software development. I remember reading an article a few years ago about how students struggling in CS benefited more from technical writing tutoring than from mathematics tutoring, yet Virginia Tech still excessively emphasizes advanced mathematics that aren't necessary whatsoever for Computer Science (namely, the later Calculus classes). There's a lot about the curriculum that could and should be changed. Before the pandemic, there were *rumors* that CS was leaving the engineering college, which is a great first step, but IDK what those plans look like now.",2021-01-19 18:31:35,3

comment,I love the CS department :),"I'm curious on where in the track line you switched fields. While I understand and see your view on a lot of the points you make, I'm not too sure if I necessarily agree. That being said, I'm am ignorant towards what other schools offer, but I can share a bit of my perspective. Advanced mathematics wasn't something I was necessarily the best at, but I can appreciate why we learn it. It's honestly probably done because VT wants their Engineering school to look prestigious, and every engineer has to take these classes. Yes, that sucks. Every school does it. Not that it's an excuse, but schools do want their degrees to hold value, and it's a benefit to us all in the end. It's a class you take as a Freshman to build skills in learning, studying, dilligence, etc. to use later on. I'm fine with it. Speaking on the systems part of CS we learn at Tech, I think the ECE department is more than what we just learn in 2505/2506/3214. ECE goes a LOT into the physics of it, while in CS, you don't deal with that. For me personally, I really enjoyed the Systems part of CS, and it's something I would have never been introduced to if it wasn't required. Is it something everyone will end up working in or enjoying? No. Not at all. But understanding how your computer works is something I feel an important part of CS, and it's not just worthless. There may be a couple of topics that you may never use again, but the class as a whole is ultimately a good learning experience. Lastly, I'll share a bit of my perspective on software dev jobs. To me, the biggest thing you learn from a VTCS degree is being able to learn a new code base and how to add on to it, or how to start a project from scratch only using the tools you know. While there's more too it, this is fundamentally what you have to do as every employer has their own code base, things they use, limitations, etc. Expanding your views on what's out there and what to keep in mind is apart of having a CS degree to me, and I do feel like just wanting to go straight into software dev isn't the right mindset, and there's already ways to do that without a degree.",2021-01-19 21:06:20,4

comment,I love the CS department :),"> I had to fight to get OS course to use something other than CVS, in ~2015. When I took the equivalent in 2004, we didn't even use source control. Was it Dr. Back who was insisting on CVS? I remember him using it for a number of projects he was working on back in 2006 through 2009 which made some sense given the time frame. But most places that were using source control were using SVN by then. I didn't start using git until around 2010. I'm surprised that he hadn't transitioned to using that in 2015 though for a course. I could understand if he continued using it for source control for existing projects he maintained if the git cvsimport tool wasn't able to handle the repositories he uses for source control. But if you really want an example of old technology, when I took the compiler course in 2007, we had to use a virtual machine program called hypomac. When running the program, it would display a message with the year it was last updated (which, IIRC, was 1981). That professor, now retired, also insisted on us printing out the source code for assignments and turning them in in addition to uploading them to his ftp server. I managed to convince him to accept a pdf of the source code instead though :). But I think these instances come down to specific professors rather than the department as a whole. They certainly could do a better job in ensuring that various technologies are used (for instance, comparing a client-server VCS versus a distributed VCS) rather than sticking to technology that's out of date for certain courses. A big example of this is the primary language used to teach lower level courses. When I was there, it was C++, but they were transitioning to Java. I could still see evidence that they had finished transitioning off of Pascal when I first started though (in 2002).",2021-01-20 08:50:19,1

Why should we force people to suffer just so that they get some useless ""prestige"" for having gone through a difficult program? There's zero net benefit to society.

[Research](https://www.npr.org/2020/06/20/880379282/the-mind-of-the-village-understanding-our-implicit-biases) shows that [the school you get your degree at doesn't matter](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/051915/university-prestige-really-important.asp) when it comes to earnings in either the short term (immediately after college) and long term (many years after completing your education). While having rigorous coursework [is statistically correlated with improved learning retention](https://www.edweek.org/leadership/studies-find-desirable-difficulties-help-students-learn/2011/04), that difficulty must serve a *purpose*. Having to grapple with a terrible, 40-year-old grading system, sitting in line for literally five hours waiting for a TA, etc is not purposeful. It doesn't teach you anything other than ""getting a CS degree sucks"". > I'm curious on where in the track line you switched fields. I switched into Political Science this semester, which is my second semester of Junior year. I held out all the way to 2506 and 3114 and at that point I started to completely flounder. Part of it was the pandemic making getting feedback on coding projects next to impossible. Part of it was a complete lack of interest in the course work on my part, mainly because most of everything in 2505 and 2506 (other than learning C) felt like a waste of time (I have no need nor desire to learn about how to build a circuit, and if the claim is that it teaches logical operators, Linear Algebra already does that and in a less convoluted and directly applicable way). I just felt like the curriculum was throwing shit at the wall and hoping it stuck. I didn't feel like I'd be able to more effectively apply my programming knowledge to new scenarios. In fact, I'd go so far as to say that my programming skills barely changed from high school to my second year of college. I didn't learn anything other than how to program in new languages, and how to use JUnit testing in Java. I didn't feel like I learned any useful problem solving or code development strategies. I didn't feel like I learned how to better think about edge cases, especially because in order to accommodate WebCAT's auto-grader, some edge cases were automatically excluded as possible inputs and others weren't, and this distinction was largely arbitrary. I won't put the blame solely on the course structure and content. The CS administration is also incompetent and lazy (the school had to *threaten* the *head* of the CS Department to update the server software for rLogin because it was decades out of date and possibly a FERPA violation).

Even with all the AWS and Azure and the rest of the virtual solutions out there, very few programmers, even newly graduated ones have an inkling of how they work, function or are delivered. There is NOTHING wrong with that. There are specialists that deal with that aspect. Having a broad based understand of computers and how they operate and how virtualization and bare metal systems work is a great add to your resume and may likely lead you towards a wider variety of job opportunities but not having that understanding won't hinder or limit them either. To further add, this is why the BIT program at VT is so successful. It is a blend that promotes a wider base of understanding of IT.

IIRC, the course also covered XHTML, XPath, and XSLT. Knowing basics like that would be useful, but having a course that specifically teaches frameworks like React or Vue would not be, because things change over time and while what's used in 2020 could be taught.

comment,I love the CS department :),"> Not the VT degree program where using anything but the pre-approved assignment tools is the standard. I also went through the VT CS program and now use a VCS, config management tool, container management tool, and languages that I didn't know when I graduated. What the CS program taught me was the importance of reading documentation and how to understand it. I now have to work with people who have no idea what the man command is for on any Linux or Debian distro. > There was and still is no encouragement of any VCS from the early classes. > > It's a critical tool, regardless of which one you choose that shouldn't be shoehorned into a 3rd year class, was my point. It's a very good point and I agree with you. When I went through the program, source control wasn't really given much thought because it wasn't thought of as a critical component 20 years ago. But there's no excuse not to treat is as one today. Assignments should be pushed to a git server and not only graded on whether the assignment works, but also the quality of the version control history (meaning one's grade would be reduced if they had commits like ""now it works"" and ""fixed bug""). When I went through the lower courses, they evaluated programs by the quality of their inline documentatoin. If you were missing function documentation blocks, you would lose points. > But having taught classes to co-workers on both git and mercurial, I needed none of that to teach how to use the tool effectively. Because they were not going out and designing a new git workflows or git based tooling. They needed to just work on code, together. I'm not sure of the background of the co-workers you taught, but why would they need classes to learn how to use a VCS rather than just read through a getting started tutorial (create repository, commit code, push to remote, fetch from remote, etc)? In general, people need to learn how to take time to read through documentation. Otherwise, you never gain more than a superficial understanding of what you're working with. If it's something you use on a daily basis, then having that deep understanding proves to be very valuable. >> Others are stuck having to copy and paste commands from stackoverflow because they don't have that background. > That's a black and white fallacy. There is a huge swath between those extremes. That has been my experience. It really comes down to people who don't want to bother reading documentation and just want to copy and paste commands somewhere to get their changes into source control. Then when it comes time to review, I see several merge commits and 10 other commits to make 3 lines of changes. I had no idea what git was when I graduated. When we started using it at my workplace, it took me a couple of days to get up to speed. I also spent several weeks reading documentation and resources to become the subject matter expert. > think if VT better understood the utility of having a SE/SA track within the CS department then we would be cooking with gas. I'm not saying there isn't room for improvement in the program. At least when I went through it, I felt I was well prepared, and with years of industry experience, I never really had problems figuring things out over time. That said, you have more recent experience with the program compared to me (now being out of it for more than a decade), so some of the deficiences are more evident now than they were when I went through it.",2021-01-20 10:27:30,1

comment,Driving back on Sunday be like...,"Pro tip: it adds some time and Google will never route you this way, BUT you'll stay moving and if it's really bad it can actually be a trip saver. If coming south you can take exit 141 and then turn left. Go to the round about and take the first exit onto Rt 311. Take a left onto Bradshaw. It's not far from the round about. That will turn into Rt 622. That takes you up and around on a 2 lane back road and eventually dumps out onto Rt 603. If you turn left here it takes you to exit 128 which is the exit it usually tries to get you off 81 and onto 460 to go up through Salem if going north. That will put you at the bottom of Christiansburg mountain and the 3 lane section of 81. It's basically taking you around on the north side of 81 instead of the south side where it's jammed packed with trucks and stop lights. Look on Maps and you'll see it make more sense.

comment,Driving back on Sunday be like...,What is the % of people that drive on that road and crash? (1) People unfamiliar with this area should not be driving the way they do on the stretch of i81. (2) That section has been getting slowly improved for over a decade - literally moving earth is not as easy as making a simple road. Here is the current expansion: https://www.virginiadot.org/projects/salem/interstate-81-widening-exit-137-to-141---roanoke-county-and-city-of-salem.asp - Almost $300 MILLION dollar project. There is usually a meeting every 1-2 years about expanding i81 but almost none of the VT population ever shows up to voice their opinion. Show up next time and maybe they’ll be more inclined to move these projects up in priority.,2022-11-28 13:02:00,0
comment,Driving back on Sunday be like...,It’s amazing how people come on here and defend VDOT. Blows my mind. Are you one of the people working on this horrible administered project or what?

Did you show up to the VDOT public meeting and show us what it should actually cost and take. Obviously not. > It shouldn’t be dangerous other than normal dangers to drive to Blacksburg and back for a game. It isn’t. People are always driving too fast for i81’s conditions like it’s the same conditions as northern stretch, i495, or i77/74. Would you rather have the state increase patrols WAY up and ticket everyone for speeding and following too closely? That should help reduce accidents.",2022-11-28 15:42:45,0
comment,Driving back on Sunday be like...,"The highway was declared inadequate about 10 years ago. Several solutions were put forth to expand the number of lanes, including a plan that called for separate truck lanes. No one (politicians) wanted to pay for any of the work, so the plans were all shelved without any further development. Gov. Northam finally got things moving by pushing for an increase in the gas tax in counties that I-81 runs through to provide funds for additional lanes and other improvements. Some of the worst sections are getting attention now as money is available. Again, what do you think should be done right now to satisfy your rant? A lot of the problems come down to what ddshd said, ""People unfamiliar with this area should not be driving the way they do"" Actually, anyone driving on I-81 needs to drive with caution.",2022-11-28 15:51:39,0

comment,WANTED: Justin Fuente,Genuine question coming from a person who has only ever done individual sports that don't rely on a coach to do well. Why does the coach in football matter so much that we all hate Fuente when the team loses? In my personal experience it is the athlete that caused the loss not the coach. But I also know nothing about football.,2021-10-24 21:07:04,13

comment,WANTED: Justin Fuente,"What I think general consensus is (but I could easily be wrong this is the first season I’ve started paying attention to CFB) is that it’s ***mostly*** the recruitment, playmaking decisions, and offensive coordination causing it, not really lack of player skill. And even if the athletes are the reason for the losses, then the coach is at fault for recruiting them.",2021-10-24 22:54:53,15
comment,WANTED: Justin Fuente,"Football is the sport where tactics and game plan and management are the most important of any sport. It is not a fluid sport like soccer or basketball where the game pretty much doesn't stop. There is a strategy every down. The coaches are responsible for drawing up a strategy for the players to execute it based on strengths of the team, weakness of the other team, how many points are needed, how much time is left, etc. Fuente and co have basically blundered every fucking time going into half, going down to the last few minutes, and just generally are never clutch or can put away games. They also struggle to be consistent in any way possible because the offense can light it up one drive, then the coaches go back to their conservative playbook and get us 3-and-outed every time after. It is the same shit every fucking game and he needs to be fired.",2021-10-24 23:40:31,11
comment,WANTED: Justin Fuente,"I'm oversimplifying, but in football the coaching staff design a new strategy against each them they play. In that strategy they identify weak points in the other team (a slow runner, someone who can't catch, etc.) and assign players who can take advantage of those skill differences. While individual match ups are important, they don't represent the full scope of the strategy because individual talents can mesh together or detract from each other. For instance, one team may have an exceptional player who has to be guarded by two players on the other team. Doing so would mean that one other player (let's call him Steve) is unguarded. Coach 1 has to decide if leaving Steve unguarded is a good idea, but during the game the coach 2 will notice and try to get the ball to Steve knowing that he won't get huge gains, but he might get a lot of smaller gains. Or maybe the coach 1 will guard Steve and leave the coach 2 to use the exceptional player more. Those decisions during the game are called ""play calling"". A lot of people who are upset with Fuentes think he is not making good play calling decisions. So, the individual is important, but the coach is managing those skills on every down, across the entire team according to his understanding of the other team and the plan he made to manage their skills.",2021-10-25 08:28:37,4

I have done gymnastics and rock climbing my whole life and very little was up to the coach in terms of how well I did. They were definitely an asset that helped me improve at times but I also spent long stretches of time without a coach in either sport and still got better and had wins and losses, good days and bad. But I can see you had an experience with coaching that was better than mine allowing you to rely on them in a way were they mattered. For me coaches were just knowledgeable and I needed to take in that knowledge while I could so that when they left I could still improve.",2021-10-25 09:02:24,3
comment,WANTED: Justin Fuente,"Agreed. Football is a great way to put a college on a map and provides a sense of pride in the alumni to come back.

If you can't have amazing academics I want basketball or football to put us on the map.",2021-10-25 00:37:54,7
comment,WANTED: Justin Fuente,"> I have done gymnastics and rock climbing my whole life and very little was up to the coach in terms of how well I did. In the NFL, there's a general manager and a head coach. They kind of work together. Generally speaking, the GM hires the head coach and they work together to build the team. Different teams do it different ways and some head coaches have more say on what players they get. But the GM will pick the players and make sure they're paid and they stay under the salary cap,etc. When a team fails, sometimes the GM gets fired, sometimes the coach gets fired, sometimes both. If the owner thinks they players are good but they're not playing up to par, the coach might get fired and the GM stays since the GM picked decent players. If the team is losing because the players are just terrible, the GM might get fired and the owner may give the coach a second chance. But Fuente is the coach and GM in this case. He recruited/picked the players AND he's the head coach so he's responsible for coaching the players. Even if he's not directly coaching them, he chose the assistants, etc. It's all on him. He has no excuses. The players suck? He picked them. They're not playing well? He coached them. Bad game management? He's in charge. His first season was 2016 so his first team or 2 was comprised of Beamers recruits and those were his 2 best seasons. Since then, it seems like it's been going down hill and unfortunately for him, he's responsible no matter what. I think you have to qualify for the Olympics, but in gymnastic terms it would be like allowing the USA Gymnastics coach to pick his team for the Olympics. He'd ultimately be responsible since he's the coach and he's picking the players.",2021-10-25 13:11:15,2
comment,WANTED: Justin Fuente,"Thank you that makes sense, I did not realize that he had so much responsibility. I can also now see why it really is him who dropped the ball. PS. In gymnastics you have to qualify to the Olympics through winning/competing at world championships and Olympic trials the ""coach"" isn't really involved in picking the team it's purely based on placement. Also most Olympic gymnasts all have different coaches and the ""coach"" at the Olympics doesn't do much. It's a little different with girls gymnastics but that has also caused alot of despicable problems so I don't look fondly at the higher ups in the USAG women's program",2021-10-25 13:27:28,1

comment,How professors should be during a time like this ❤️💯 #respect,"Honestly, I don't know why some teachers are still bring so strict about classes. All of mine have been super accomadating whereas my friends have some teachers who rename their lack of accommodation to just ""keeping structure"". Seriously, most of us cut professors leniency when it comes to changing office hours and big events in life and we are the ones paying for the education. Considering the majority of our tuition was wasted because we are paying in person rates to take online classes the least a professor could do is make it as flexible as online too. Stack this on top of teachers who are complaining about people coming back to blacksburg so they can focus more on schoolwork and there is a lot of conflicting arguments. I geuss basically if you are a professor reading this just remmeber our school Moto is ""Ut Prosim"" and in this case that means being more accomadating.

comment,How professors should be during a time like this ❤️💯 #respect,"I understand where you're coming from but the education system that we are in really doesn't favor either student or professor over test scores. If I have to memorize answers for a test then that says very little about your actual teaching. Skills based testing and activities reflect more on a student's knowledge of the content and the professor's ability to teach and if those are open book and the test is well written an open book test isn't going to affect scores as much. Most students are undergoing more stress than normal which means traditional testing, if it already wasn't bad enough, will become harder. Why not let tests be open book? We already know next semester's classes are going to be affected by this semester and theres no way to save that. Hopefully your colleges can understand that not only do we have to adapt this semester, but in the semesters to come.",2020-04-22 11:57:20,3

comment,How professors should be during a time like this ❤️💯 #respect,"Okay, I see your side of it. I just have a hard time believing that giving a final will help the students more than not. Your attitude of fishing through the students to find the best ones comes off as pretty lazy. Maybe you are portraying yourself wrong, so I'm going to hope your attitude when teaching students is to help them as much as possible not to sort through the ones not worth helping. Guess what? We basically paid for a service we didn't get. By all means, it is totally worth it in the grand scheme of things, it was the right thing to do. Just an idea, you could tell your students what you just told us. You could tell them it is really important for them to know the material well and help them out by giving them resources for learning it. Making sure they are successful under the circumstances we are in goes far beyond just giving an open notes final trying to weed out students. Offering them additional notes or video lectures could easily replace or outdo the effects of a take-home final.",2020-04-22 18:29:39,3

If you REALLY watched him, he did EVERY little thing right. He made every correct option read to a point it was extremely noticeable when compared to what Drones does. He had pocket awareness that not many college QBs show, let alone any VT QB in the last decade. He put legitimate touch on all his passes and probably should have had at least 1-2 more “big” plays in the passing game if the receivers played better. I’m not trying to overreact and say he’s gonna win a Heisman or anything, and I know it was “just UVA.” But he genuinely showed more promise than most VT QB’s ever have in the last decade+. If he wasn’t a major priority for the coaches to keep entering tonight, he needs to be now.

comment,I saw this on someone's snap story today and it nearly brought me to tears. Good luck on finals!,"This is awesome. Reminds me of the feelings I had visiting the memorial every 4/16 when I went to Tech, and walking through Norris Hall on 4/16 my senior year. I typed out what it says - mostly because it's hard to see the punctuation, partly to keep reading it over and over: >In 2009 I found this room during finals week. I sat with kids in this room who had witnessed the screams, the cries of the shooting. They were a close group of friends - just trying to get through. One was even in Norris Hall that day. >I graduated in 2013 and came back for a masters degree in 2016. I just finished my masters degree 5 minutes ago in this room that's meant so much to me -- I came to this room in 2011 when I found out my sister was dying, to cry so my roomates wouldn't hear. I came here in 2012 w/ my best friends to wait until faculty left to sneak onto the balcony upstairs and drink beer on a warm fall night. And I came here every finals week with my ex-GF whose smile could light Lane Stadium. I avoided this room the past 2-yrs in grad school until tonight, because I miss how simple, how pure, and how honest that time was. I know a lot of numbers and equations go on in this room - and one day, you'll forget them - but you'll never forget the moments and the people of your 4-yrs at Virginia Tech.",2018-05-05 00:27:48,42

What's happened is that the Montgomery County water authority can't get the ultra-fine silt particles to settle out of the water fast enough so there's silt in the water. BECAUSE there's silt in the water, they can't PROMISE you that there isn't bacteria in the water. This is distinct from ""we have detected bacteria in the water"" which has NOT happened. So out of an overabundance of caution, everyone is being advised to boil their water JUST IN CASE there's bacteria in it (even though, again, no one has detected any). This water is perfectly fine for showering, washing dishes, and anything else that doesn't involve you drinking it. Honestly, it's probably fine for you to drink TOO but we're being cautious. But yes, there are ultrafine silt particles in it. If you filled a 10 gallon aquarium with this water and let it settle out you'd get about enough dirt on the bottom to fill a teaspoon. And that's what it would be -- dirt. An ultra-fine, sandy soil. I know, because I've spent the last week cleaning up flood damage and multiple inches of that stuff is EVERYWHERE. But it's perfectly safe to bathe with.",2024-10-02 16:18:34,119

comment,I think we all need a drink after that game,UVA played quite well. Both teams played tough tough football. Neither rolled over for the other. This is what a true rivalry looks like and based on what Bronco is doing there yall better get used to this. Our team is so young and will improve for next year. That was only hookers 7th start. That really showed at times today but he will only get better. Hopefully coaches do a good job of forming the disappointment into fuel for the bowl game and next season. The only real way this loss hurts is in making recruiting a bit tougher in state. Of course we have a lot more control over how that goes.,2019-11-29 19:35:33,6

Clemson was mideore for 30 years. They also won the lottery with Dabo. That was pure luck. Clemson doesn't have that much bigger an athletic department than VT does.

I feel we’re regressing in football, this year was better than last year win wise but just slightly. 2 of our wins were FCS opponents and the UVA loss kinda spoiled the season.

comment,266 Yards - Bhayshul Tuten Breaks Virginia Tech’s Single Game Rushing Record,"We have to be able to hold and keep a lead!! We could have beaten Rutgers, Miami and the game almost got away from us again in the 3rd. If we give the ball up 2 and 3 times a game against Georgia, Cuse or Clemson it’s gonna be a mess.

comment,266 Yards - Bhayshul Tuten Breaks Virginia Tech’s Single Game Rushing Record,"I have a bone to pick with ESPN. Look I’m sure that some fans left early. But they rolled some footage of some Hokie fans downtown lined up outside a restaurant and the commentators were talking about them leaving early, they’ll be surprised to see the score, etc. The bumper footage they run isn’t live. They send crews out ahead of games to film random stuff around campus and town, and then they save that video for years. I know because I’ve been in a bumper years after I left Blacksburg. They don’t have a live camera crew outside TOTS during the game.",2024-10-18 15:15:23,3
comment,266 Yards - Bhayshul Tuten Breaks Virginia Tech’s Single Game Rushing Record,One thing I've learned from watching Hokie Football is to never give up early because you never know what will happen. We always either choke or come back.,2024-10-18 11:26:36,3

comment,266 Yards - Bhayshul Tuten Breaks Virginia Tech’s Single Game Rushing Record,It was also Thursday.

comment,266 Yards - Bhayshul Tuten Breaks Virginia Tech’s Single Game Rushing Record,"I thought we were going to have a usual Hokies’ blow it game.

comment,266 Yards - Bhayshul Tuten Breaks Virginia Tech’s Single Game Rushing Record,True. They usually do. It makes more sense given this was a Thursday night game as well. I just didn’t expect that much of the East side stands to leave.,2024-10-18 09:47:32,5
comment,266 Yards - Bhayshul Tuten Breaks Virginia Tech’s Single Game Rushing Record,"Just ignored literally everything I said lol. Rather not have med teams in the stands caring for drunk college kids wearing t shirts. I was there till the end, the intensity remained high to the point that the boo birds came out in the 3rd. If anything I think the fans helped avoid a total collapse.",2024-10-18 13:25:53,8
comment,266 Yards - Bhayshul Tuten Breaks Virginia Tech’s Single Game Rushing Record,"Lol, no. Listen, teams like to tell fans that they matter and they do to some extent.

comment,266 Yards - Bhayshul Tuten Breaks Virginia Tech’s Single Game Rushing Record,"The intensity of the crowd plays a role in the game. The crowd had no intensity in the 2nd half. Our defense in the 3rd could have fed off of support. The broadcast took cameras downtown to find the fans and called out multiple times how ""The Vt team could really use some fans right about now"". Staidum looked like almost 50% left",2024-10-18 14:02:44,-1

comment,Virginia Tech WBB defeats UVA in front of the second ever sold out Cassell Crowd,"Womens basketball was an afterthought for a very very long time at Tech, there was a time when us other student athletes would roll in after our practice to cool down and watch the womens games. The max crowd was like 200-300 ...150 ish were friends of the girls and fellow athletes then maybe 25 family members at most and an away family & friends. You could sit anywhere as there were only like 2 rows of reserved seats right behind each team. I can remember fondly being shooshed!! over the course of the season because we were making them laugh as everyone could hear anything you yelled at the other team or them. You didn't exactly have to yell loudly to be heard when there's less than 300 folks at a home game.... After a few good starts and at least one good coach moving to greener pastures Tech finally ponied up the money and got KB. He has done nothing but great things for the program and he deserves every accolade we can bestow upon him. He gives me hope that I might finally see a team national champion in a sport at Tech in my lifetime !!",2024-02-02 14:22:30,3

comment,Virginia Tech WBB defeats UVA in front of the second ever sold out Cassell Crowd,"Men only, the UVA women are the Alabama of swimming right now...and just to further clarify, dual meets don't mean much in swimming...its nice but a teams dual meet record means zero as teams are in different phases of training when they compete against each other. It's all about conference and even more so NCAAs. That's what its all about. Whoever has the most at NCAA's with A times or high B is the team to watch.

comment,What a game,"No, I don't play team sports, but I know from a large body of research that most sports [encourage aggressive behaviors in men](https://steinhardt.nyu.edu/appsych/opus/issues/2015/fall/passero) both on and off the field, especially football. Sports also [causes tribalism](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/brown-center-chalkboard/2018/08/29/the-dangers-of-tribalism-and-callousness-in-college-sports/) in fans which is [exploited by corporations](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/46388987_Fandom_affiliation_and_tribal_behaviour_A_sports_marketing_application) to influence these fans to buy not only game tickets and season passes, but memorabilia and products targeted at these fans. Meanwhile colleges make millions of dollars off of sports-related sales and the athletes get nothing - frequently, their attendance at the school is predicated on their continuation in sports. The entire system of college sports is disgusting, abhorrent, and I cannot in any way support it. National sports are not quite as bad because the athletes get paid, but there are other systemic issues involved in that aspect as well which I won't get in to.

comment,I am once again asking for VT to update the covid dashboard by noon as promised,Don't make promises you can't keep. People can still think VT is a great school and criticize something they do. Not mutually exclusive,2020-09-09 17:26:16,24

comment,I am once again asking for VT to update the covid dashboard by noon as promised,"Yeah my point is that parents are probably looking at the VT dashboard (especially if they’re out of state), and that it’s horribly misleading. Either give us useful data or *just* link the state government’s site, since the VT dashboard as it is now does more harm than good imo",2020-09-10 10:28:10,3
comment,I am once again asking for VT to update the covid dashboard by noon as promised,It sucks that our only choices are: - tacitly approve of this bullshit by continuing to give them money - stop giving them money and smother programs trying to do what they can in spite of it,2020-09-09 14:21:17,31

comment,I am once again asking for VT to update the covid dashboard by noon as promised,that’s literally how it works. the BOV acts at the pleasure of the governor and the president acts at the will of the BOV but whatever,2020-09-09 15:20:34,-33
comment,I am once again asking for VT to update the covid dashboard by noon as promised,"But the BOV doesn't really select the person for office. They approve of the choices and recommendations given to them by a _wide_ group of representation. Sure, they could say ""NO! NEVER JIM SMITH!"" but they'd spend a lot of political capital if they were trying to maneuver people into place, capital better spent elsewhere. So, you're wrong.",2020-09-09 18:03:20,14
