To the daughter of the woman I hooked up with last night I met her at TOTS Saturday night and she told me you were a sophomore studying neuro and she said you brought her out to have fun but then abandoned her to talk to “some redheaded beanpole.” Was really uncool of you to leave your mom alone like that especially since she doesnt even drink. Dunno why you would take her to TOTS in the first place. just wanted to let you know I took care of her and that she’s really sweet and you should be more grateful for her.

gotta be one of the craziest posts i’ve seen on here

Big dog the way you're talking that's gonna be your stepdaughter if you see her mom again.

Thank you for your service

Saw the exact same post on r/uiuc

Ah, TOTS. Never change.

this is amazing 😭

The bots have gotten specific.

While sober too

Is this going to turn into one of those posts where everyone starts posting as another member of the family, the woman herself, the bartender, the Uber driver and eventually the dog? I’d enjoy that.

This is the shit post of shit posts. Did op find a $20 after this!

How old is the mom ? 5? And this was in Tot Lots?😂

Virginia is for mother-fuckers

This feels like a copypasta

This is weird. Given that I follow a few different university subs, I've seen this post, almost word for word, reposted.

This is not real

Same post on UIUC sub

VT student arrested for $230,000 drug bust, over 10 pounds of psychoactive drugs found

Four pounds of ibogaine? 20 years ago no one outside of serious drug nerds knew about the properties of ibogaine, a hallucinogenic shrub from Africa that causes a grueling 36 hour 'trip' which has long been alleged to be the magic bullet for curing opiate addiction. When I was caught up in the oxy thing in 00s I had looked into trying it but the costs were prohibitive. From what I read about it, the ibogaine experience could be so grueling that unless you were trying for the opiate cure, you wouldn't want to mess with it recreationally. More extreme and longer lasting than ayahuasca, it's also hepatoxic and can be fatal to persons with a rare gene combination. AND super expensive. Everything else he had were your basic party drugs - I notice nothing "hard" - half of it is cannabis related. But four pounds of ibogaine? That's a real headscratcher. Maybe he had imported a big 'ol living plant and they're charging him with whole weight of it, although it's the only the root that's psychoactive - that's typical cop shit. Here's a reasonable BBC article about ibogaine. It's a very interesting substance. https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-17666589

Bro is quite the entrepreneur Imagine the capex required for this

Invent the future baby

Bro what's going on in slusher 😭

He was stashing this on campus too in a dorm room. Insane.

Inhale this but do not touch. I smell nothing. What you do not smell is called ibocaine powder. It is odorless, tasteless, dissolves instantly in liquid and is among the more psychoactive drugs known to Virginia Tech students.

Damn, now where am I suppose to get shrooms and mdma , kingpin of Blacksburg taken out. 😂 Jokes aside, if you’re a responsible and knowledgeable user then do whatever floats your boat; stay safe out there!

There was a huge DMT bust while I was a student. Driving for BT my coworker had the Terrace View loop and they got rerouted. decided to walk over (I lived on Kabrich) and the first floor apartment was completely surrounded. Cops blocking the roads. I could not help but feel it was overkill, even for the bored cops in a town like blacksburg. Their practices are super shady when it comes to drugs. weed wasn't even legal back then though, so tons of people were getting arrested. can't imagine what it must be like now as a student smoking without the paranoia of having blacksburg cops sniffing around Edit: I hope Chris(?) over at nice dreamz is benefitting from legality. he was always a super cool dude to people and had surprisingly quality glass for a hole in the wall shop on Main

Hey man, Hokie respect

That math ain’t mathing! Interesting to see Ibogaine on there. I think people will have completely different opinions on these substances in the next century. I definitely could’ve benefitted from psychedelics and less alcohol during my time at VT. Sure as hell shouldn’t get him life in prison IMO.

I'm guessing this is going to dry up the ibogaine scene in town.

it was on campus btw, in payne hall

The PD clearly has no idea the value of drugs and just made that shit up

Not cocaine Not meth Not heroin Not fentanyl Who cares. Free him on probation

Invent the Future

life in prison? come on

Aw man. Ibogaine, MDMA, and psilocybin... This poor kid was providing medicine. It's so sickening that we still put people in jail for these types of drugs. I know they can be dangerous but goddamn

During the 1972 Democratic race, Hunter Thompson spread a rumor that Ed Muskie was an ibogaine addict. https://theplaidzebra.com/hunter-s-thompson-spread-rumor-presidential-candidates-drug-addiction-taken-seriously/ Edit: typo

Damn it, what the fuck am I meant to do now? Ugh what a pain

I mean, our motto is "That I May Serve"! Bro was serving for sure.

At this point legalize it

Wait, *those* are the "terrible, horrible, no-good, very-bad drugs"? Free him.

This is a complete exaggeration. Borderlines on corruption because these cops want it to look like they took all the drugs out of vt. 204k of the 237k was ibogaine in ROOT form. "raw iboga root sells for about $2,000 a kilogram. Medical-grade pure ibogaine, which is extracted from the root bark, costs as much as $150,000 a kilogram" -The Guardian. He had 2kgs. This is a CLEAR gross misrepresentation. #Freejulius

Possible life in prison. Wtf Imagine putting a non violent arrest away for life. Some bullshit

2.08 lbs of psilocybin mushrooms (estimated street value of $1,500 &#x200B; what cheap ass street is he on?!

Imagine making it into Vt and then throwing your whole future away

Hokie hokie hokie high as balls

sounds like a fungi

ya hate to see it

Where did he live in Bburg?

It bro goes to jail, he should get no more than a month with probation. Everything over that is too extreme for a dealer

That college had to be built on cursed land.

Bro was aiming to be the new Pablo Escobar. He could’ve used his entrepreneurial skills for good. Is the money really worth years in prison and inability to live a normal life after?

Damn wish I knew buddy for they got his ass I’m tryna quit these oxys if yall know somewhere I can get the treatment done let me know or anything else that may have worked for yall

What an asshole.

Yeah the valuation of that stuff was $204k. The whole haul was valued at $230k. I have never heard of this drug and after description have no urge to ever use it.

Ed Muskie's entire Presidential campaign got jackknifed once someone started a rumor that he had been doing ibogaine with a Brazilian witch doctor. Hunter S. Thompson later said in an interview " What terrible rumors, I should know, I started them"

I'm laughing at how they reported their $ amounts in the highest resale value possible. Damn cop shit.

I built Burruss Hall in Minecraft! :)

Love the attention to detail with the BT bus graphics!

Man this looks great. Does anyone remember that group that was building the whole campus in minecraft? OP should help with that project if it's not done yet lol

That looks great! Except the busses don't stop there any more. And they're usually wrapped with advertising for an optometrist. :)

How much time did it take? Haven't played Minecraft.

Showed the picture to my wife asking “you recognize that?” She immediately went with “yeah it’s virginia tech”. So yeah, amazing job!

Well done honestly, looks great with the lighting 👌

Wait I love her—🥰 nice work!

Omg this is amazing. Is the inside done?

Wow so awesome

Lovely work!

Aww the BT buses 🥹

This is awesome!

Tutorial when 👀🙏

That's so sick

Bro that’s awesome!!!

I love it!!!

This is amazing!

AWEESSOMEEE

I was visiting the other week and remarked to my friend that I would love to see the campus recreated in Minecraft. Love what you did here!

I’m gonna guess it’s built in creative mode, but if you did this in survival that’d be epic

Really cool. My kids and I love Minecraft.

this is awesome 👏

Man I miss minecraft

Wow! That's awesome. Reminds me of the days, long time ago, I lived in the dorms and did nothing but play video games too hahahaha.

Looks incredible, too bad buses don’t stop there anymore

it looks like the white house ngl. !!

SEED SEED SEED SEED. Hokies for the MF W!!!! WHO DO THEY THINK THEY ARE?!!?!! I AMMMMMMMMMM

Yeah I found this unfinished world today from before the loops and decided to finish it, so that’s why the busses are there lol

Buses don’t stop there anymore? Man I feel older and older every time I get on this sub

Maybe like 10 hours total

Thanks! Nah just the exterior

Crosspost this to r/MinecraftBuilds too, I’m sure they’ll appreciate this as well! 😄

Please make a post with all this

That's a bummer, I kinda liked how it let off-campus people see Burrus up close as part of their routine, best building on campus

That's a relatively new development. They built a transit hub just north of Whittemore and now all the busses to campus stop there. It just opened this past fall. There are a couple of busses that run a circuit on campus that you can change to there. I don't ride BT often enough to know how well its working, but it does make sense to stop the busses somewhere that doesn't involve them having to stop for on-campus pedestrians. And there are plenty of shelters for folks who are waiting.

UVA WILL NEVER BEAT US UPVOTE PARTY

Don’t let UVA losing to a #16 seed distract you from the fact that the worst VT team in 30 years just beat their best team in a decade

A couple more years of this and the "my dog has never seen a UVA win" joke will be obsolete. What kind of dog lives that long?

This was literally their best chance and they still couldn't do it ahahahaha

LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOooo

HOKIE HOKIE HOKIE HI!!!

15 years. Let’s make it 15 more! E: 2 years later, I'm in pain

Let's go!!!

That was a little scary at the end but we did it!

To be fair, the did end a streak: our losing streak.

SAY YOUR PRAYERS

HHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAUMBCHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA

I feel at this point that it’s more 15 years of incompetence on their end than 15 years of dominance by us lol

If we can beat them this season, we can beat them any season! Let’s goooooooooooo

How are they this bad lmaooo they really can’t beat us 😂😂

@Marshall: U up?

WHAT’S A HOKIE

The only university that chokes more than the Chokies in sports is UVa hahahahahaha

They may have taken our Biocomplexity Institute, stealing all our faculty and $100m in contracts, leaving dozens of us students without advisors or money, and dozens of wage staff worried about their jobs and retirements - but they shall not take our football streak!!!

!!!! :D XD XD XD

FAM! Wahoo tears taste sweetest when collected and consumed using the Commonwealth Cup!

I was 10 trillion % confident we were going to lose that game after the pick. Like I knew it would happen. And then it didn't. Unreal.

UVA is a joke

I got 10 years older watching this game.

I wish I could go back to 2003 and talk to 17 yo me as I snuck out of Scott stadium in shame with a friend and we had a long quiet drive back to Blacksburg: this was the price we had to pay, it will all be worth it.

The incels over at Sabre are claiming a deflategate. Womp womp

Think you're spot on regarding VT being unique and standing on it's own. It is folly to recast VT in another universities image. Blacksburg itself is a big piece of what makes Hokie alums such rabid supporters of the school. The New River, Main Street, the sunsets over the mountains, etc. If you want a sprawling and disjointed Rutgers or UC type campus, go there. Think Frank Beamer epitomized embracing the school for what it is, loving it and working hard to make that "thing" stronger. If Sands is using VT as a stepping stone, I hope he moves on soon. Think Sands hails from Purdue...wonder if there is something in his past driving him to inchoate the school. I would hope there is a board of trustees providing course corrections.

I come back to this post every time we lose lol

TO SHARKEY’S

>A couple more years of this and the "my dog has never seen a UVA win" joke will be obsolete. What kind of dog lives that long? There's your new punchline. "It's been X years! What kind of a dog lives that long?"

We'll just start talking about tortoises.

Actually, mine lived for 16 years... and smaller ones can live to 18-20 if you take care of them and they get extremely lucky health wise. It's rare though. Cats can live to 18-20 I think too.

I'm currently dogsitting for a medium large (German Shepherd sized) dog who's 18 years old. She's a marvel. A marvel who can't control her bowels, but still, a marvel.

TECH TECH VPI!!!!

Was going through old work from elementary school. 10 year old me gave 27 year old me whiplash.

You can’t possibly have written that 17 years ago, I was at Tech during the shooting and… Oh god it’s been 17 years. How did time go so fast?

VT, Tech, or Virginia Tech please /s

is that a 9 out of 10 or the date

As someone who is deeply connected to that tragedy, and has the anniversary coming up in a month - fist bump, ‘lil Devon. You’re a good kid.

Yo, my teacher did this and when I read this letter when I was older, I was so disappointed in myself. I still haven’t got over this.

Going to cubs? Did you misspell clubs? And you were clubbing at 10?

I misread this. so very misread this.

I was teaching in McBryde Hall when the shooting took place. I couldn't contain my feelings watching the bodies being carried out of Norris. The VT president, Charles Steger, decided not to close campus after the first shooting. A decision which cost many others their lives.

The first few sentences were so normal and wholesome then BOOM.

Bruh why isn't this a 10/10

That guy went to Westfield high school, the Va Tech shooter. He was in my sister's math class. Weird kid.

????????? the virginia tech shooting was 17 years ago ?????????

So how do you and your brother get along these days? Is he still trying to be the boss of you?

It’s Virginia Polytechnic Institute

Right?! Same here. Hopefully you didn't have the pleasant experience of reporters wanting to get your opinion when you just wanted to go to west end for food.

I was a student and working in the 2nd floor of Norris Hall at the time. I was part of the group that evacuated Torg with the first bomb threat, since we had an office there and one of my coworkers found out very early. We were all brought to the theatre the next day by two FBI agents who showed us the bomb threats on a projection screen to ask if any of us recognized a students handwriting. The only thing that was said from anyone in the group was that “the periods are little circles - those are often common in certain Asian countries.” And all of that - as significant as it was - was wiped out a few days later by the tragedy. It amazes me that the FBI still says “there was no indication of who could have made the bomb threats” in their report after I heard that with my own ears.

My thoughts exactly, sigh

My 1st cousin played on the football team that year and was the defense lead. He played rover/linebacker/safety.

You will be dead before you know it

Want some more whiplash? I wasn't even alive then

Ur old hahahaahahahahahahahahah

Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University

please, i rep virginia agricultural and mechanical college until i die

Hokie hokie hokie hi Tech tech VPI Sola Rex Sola rah Polytech virgin-e-a

9/10. -1 for “Virginian Technological College”

I’m starting to think this is a form of abuse

lol probably cub scouts

I thought it was West Springfield HS? But obviously if your sister went to school with the shooter, I must be confused

That Korean kid? 😱 That’s scary!

it’s called a cross post? i’m not claiming to be OOP

That was so traumatizing. Was living in WAJ and felt so awful for just wanting to have food… and my walk to West End was so eerie.

I was living off campus at the time, but I also worked for the University in a public facing role so they were very particular that we shouldn’t speak to the press. I got to see George Bush drive by in a car real fast though!

It was a weird time at Tech. The other thing that’s forgotten is that in the fall semester we had another shooter scare. I remember sitting in the big lecture hall in Squires when the police came in and told us to stay in place, then a few minutes later they came back in and told us to evacuate. No clear instructions or explanations just get out. It was a mad house and the cops were running back and forth (I just booked it away home and called it a day on the first day of classes) because someone had reported seeing the escaped prisoner who shot his way out of the hospital in the building. I thought then how screwed we would be given the cops response to the threat of a shooter. I often now wonder if that day had any impact on what happened in April the next year.

I believe there are way more incidents like this where the Intel, indicators and red flags are all there ahead of time but possibly not acted upon.

RAY RAH VPI TEAM TEAM TEAM *awkward turkey gurgle noise*

More like 9/11 for that tragedy

Wooden Car racing and S’mores 😃

Yeah he went to Westfield in Chantilly, VA.

This was the same year when, earlier in the year, we were in lockdown because a guy shot a cop (IIRC). Everyone used the canceled classes to day party. What a weird year. Edit: I think we’re talking about the same incident from the fall.

In fairness - what do you do with that information? It helps you narrow down, but not identify, a target. This was well before hyper-surveillance (I know Norris certainly didn't have it, I believe Torg at the time was only at entrances/exits IIRC). Still, to say explicitly in the report "the bomb threat note was determined not to be the same in Norris by handwriting analysis" seems weird to me. That said, I only saw the Torg bomb threat, not the Norris Hall one, so maybe he shifted his handwriting style.

That reminds me of that airline: 9/11 Airlines

I think we’re referring to the same event. It was a convict who shot a cop at a hospital and they thought was hiding in Squires.

A lot of people say the worst part was the towers getting hit, but i think the worst part was the hypocrisy

Friendly reminder that pirating textbooks is unethical and you should totally avoid using these websites. Stay alert! I wanted to send out a friendly reminder that using sites such as [libgen](https://libgen.rs/) or [Anna's Archive](https://annas-archive.org/) is unethical and you should avoid them at all costs. These sites have many free textbooks that should normally cost $150, and students use it instead of spending their limited money on more education materials (after paying thousands on tuition already)! [Here is a full list of most used piracy websites](https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/wiki/megathread/books/) for those who want to stay extra careful not to accidentally visit and use them! Please remind anyone you can to avoid these sites at all costs! Thanks!

Stay very very far away from fmhy.net, which is a aggregator for a majority of piracy websites.

Yeah i would not advise anyone looking for a textbook to go to google, type the name of your textbook and then add ".pdf" with the quotes and search. Dont do that.

Oh and I forgot to mention how awful and illegal using z-library can be for academic papers. Its the worst.

Bro, you sent this warning out too late. It’s already the 2nd week of classes!

yOu wOuLdNt sTeal a cAr

I'm only here for directions on how to get away from here.

Please be aware that this reminder is also applies to international students in particular who are coming from low income countries, in which $150 is equal to your whole month gross salary before tax even if you have a master's degree. Downloading materials from mentioned websites are still unethical even though it's expensive AF for you, who told you to come to the US to get your education? Jokes on you!

“Please go to your nearest fake Barnes and Noble and buy a $500 12 and 1/2th Edition textbook that also sells overpriced school memorabilia and sweatshirts that only your parents want to buy…”

Avoid saving money, don't shop around for textbooks, and pay the inflated school bookstore prices. The school needs to pay for the overpaid administration Zars.

Also don’t search for “book title” solutions.pdf either

I'm glad there are so many likeminded individuals here, fighting against the evil that is textbook piracy!

Uhhhh- last year it was literally impossible to get our required textbook from the bookstore or anywhere else and we HAD to collectively use Anna’s archive as a class due to the chronic backorder. Nobody could get their textbooks for that class within a reasonable time frame, especially considering it had assignments due early on, and the earliest to get one was at least halfway through the semester. Our professor was fully aware of this and took no issue with it due to the circumstances.

Big Pearson Energy

Use a vpn, q bit torrent and 1337x to look up books. Don’t get suckered into giving these scammers like op thousands of dollars for a book that you use for 6 months.

Double friendly reminder that a day old account with one post might not have the most honest intentions.

Universities & professors are the pirates charging for new textbooks every year with little to no significant changes to the previous year & renting electronic content that expires. Fuck them. I encourage people to continue to use creative methods to get their piece of paper degrees and keep down costs. University degrees are extremely overrated. I have 5 degrees to include from Georgetown, MIT & Stanford. These so-called higher learning institutions have become a failed experiment in diversity & mediocracy that enjoy taking out-of-state funding to pass foreign students who barely speak/understand English. When I hire ITY professionals, if they attended an Ivy League caliber school, it serves as a strike against them in my evaluation and I am definitely not the only one these days.

why not use them? Why not save money😂

Also avoid doing filetype:pdf

Sci-hub is another one of these heathen sites for academic papers!

My later in life schooling I always waited until at least the first class before buying the textbook. Gave me time to ask the professor if an ebook or older revision was acceptable.

I would download one though...

Yea it’s crazy… usually on Amazon, look for a used version of an older edition..,sometimes it’ll bring it down to like $30

An intl student coming to Tech is in most cases the definition of "not low income" even if their country might be low income

Certainly don’t use Amazon, or maybe Facebook marketplace for students wanting to get rid of their textbooks

I am very tired and didn’t read all the way through to realize this was satire. Someone plz wake me up to take my final for the class I’m finishing within the 2 week trial period to avoid paying $100 for the temporary electronic access fee. 🥱 we love asynchronous classes being fully unlocked day 1 so you don’t have to wait for deadlines and access fees.

Good point. But for those worried, I'm an 11 year old account and I second *LibGen*. Also I want to add *sci-hub [dot] se* for scientific papers, and *12ft [dot] io* for online news sites. I often use sci-hub even though VT pays for me to have legitimate access. I'm too lazy to connect to the VPN or log into the library for one stupid paper, just give it to me!

Is the day old account in the room with us now?

The point of that entire message went right over your head lol

certainly dont contact the authors and ask for a copy

Yeah but it’s nearly the end of week 2. Everyone either bought or pirated at this point. Either way, this is a PSA for freshies so they wouldnt know this

And i have a feeling that this comment was also satire

Anyone have an old red stick shift truck with bench seats in a PDF format? Looking to download one for my bf.

Most grad students aren't, they rely on monthly stipend from their research projects.

University needs to get with the program and use certificate-based VPN auth imo. Our division uses it and the only drawback is that our folks never know what they need to be on VPN for, so I tell them it's always ok to be on the VPN. Seriously, we have a one click solution.

Well, yes, actually. Even if they are 4 months old. Hey do what you like. It's the Internet. I'm not a cop. Be as stupid and unenlightened as you wanna be, but there's consequences. e: the Venn diagram of the people downvoting me that believed there was free candy in the van and nothing could possibly go wrong blindly trusting a brand new account is a circle. Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law.

bruh why would i pay money for words if i can get em for free, its not unethical, whats unethical is charging 100$ for something that it doesnt cost them that much to make because its electronic😂

okay this is hilarious

Oh sorry forgot that grad students existed lol

You still not getting it is funny. OP is saying it’s unethical but really they are helping people pirate by providing good links.

The point is this was satire for all the freshies out there who didn’t know ANY of this info.

You have a fair point though, the undergrad students from my country at Tech are like top 5% of our society.

Has anyone seen this person? Sharing post seen on Facebook for exposure!

Not letting me edit the post but I am NOT related to this person, simply posting to try to get the word out! I will not be able to communicate anything with the family so do please contact the police!

Doesn't the Huckleberry trail connect the mall and where his apartment is over in Merrimac? I hope they're looking through that area

Here's the update: At 3 p.m. on Tuesday, Feb. 20, the Montgomery County Sheriff's Office distributed the following update. It appears in its entirety below. In regards to Jonathan "Johnny" Roop, investigators are continuing to pursue every lead; however, the preliminary investigation leads us to believe that he left the area of Montgomery County on his own Friday afternoon. Based upon information received it is believed that he most likely traveled toward SW Virginia or Tennessee. Investigators have been able to access video surveillance footage from local businesses/financial institutions and Mr. Roop was observed in the Christiansburg area of Montgomery County until around 3:30pm on Friday. Based on interviews with friends and family (in addition to video surveillance) it was noted that Mr. Roop's behavior on Friday was not consistent with his normal patterns of behavior; however, information received seems to indicate that he was alone. We have received no information leading us to believe that he is in immediate danger; however due to the fact that Mr. Roop appears to be acting outside of his normal behavior we would like to make contact with him to confirm that he is indeed ok. https://news.vt.edu/articles/2024/02/police-missing-person.html

Something must have really been bothering him if he left of his own accord. I wonder about depression, grades, girlfriend, etc - I pray he is and stays okay.

Engaging for exposure, hope he is found safe!

Will be driving through that same area tomorrow and will have eyes wide open for Johnny Roop.

I pray that he is found safe and can return to his family and friends asap.

They just posted an update. They spotted him at a local business with surveillance footage, and believe he left the Christiansburg area around 3:30

I’m sorry for what your family is going through. I hope your step-brother is safe, and simply decided to do a digital detox. Johnny, it seems like a lot of people care about you —even this internet stranger. Please take care and let your family know how and where you are doing.

I wondered if they checked out his banking and credit card activity? He may have stopped at an atm.

His sister commented an hour ago in another thread that he was spotted at a Starbuck’s in Poplar, Missouri. Please call home Johnny or call 911. Everyone is looking for you and praying for you.

Is there any update about Johnny?

Hi all! The most recent update I’ve seen is from today as follows: Update: Johnny was spotted in a Starbucks in Poplar Buff Missouri. Montgomery Police Department told us that once they have video footage of him being okay…they will no longer consider him a “missing person”. Starbucks told the police it would be 5-7 days before they release the footage to them of Johnny in the store. What no one is understanding is that Johnny is NOT okay. This is not just “school stress”. Whether it is something mental or physical…something is wrong. We have no clue what is going to happen. Our family is literally begging…do not give up on finding him. Please. PLEASE keep sending prayers for Johnny and our family. We have obtained lots of new information in the past 24 hours. We will post updates when we are able to, but the best thing everyone can do right now is to be on the lookout, and not just in our local area, let your friends and family know that live in other states. We need this spread everywhere…

While it is good news that he appears physically well, chances are he is not mentally well. The absolute best would be some kind of contact because if having a mental health crisis, anything can happen. Hopefully police realize this. Prayers for all involved.

Sincerely hope he is okay and will come home soon. I’m sure there’s many things on his mind that needs processing and he shouldn’t have to do it alone☹️

Does he have any history of depression?

Chances are he is having a mental health crisis of some sort. Sometimes when the image of you held by others does not align with your authentic self, the pressure can be too much to handle. I am confident his loved ones will still love him if this is the case. If so, I hope he finds comfort in re-aligning his core values and garnering support from all who truly care about him. Perfection is highly overrated.

Yes definitely, thank you!🫶🏻

Yes. Triggers. I know we’re just speculating, but that age and situation can make a person want to flee. Speaking from experience—I abruptly left school at 20, overwhelmed. He may not want to admit that to friends and family. Only thing is, this can be a hint at feelings that will hijack you (again) later in life if you chalk them up to just college burnout. Praying hard tonight for Johnny’s physical + emotional well-being.

This link has even more info: [https://www.facebook.com/photo?fbid=730022855902507&set=a.377365117834951](https://www.facebook.com/photo?fbid=730022855902507&set=a.377365117834951)

Just to clarify, he was not spotted in that area. His phone pinged in that area. He was last seen around 10am. Praying he is found safely.

I will add on to this, he lived pretty close to cburg, so he would’ve left earlier but he hung around.

It was just on the news, they had a picture of the dude at a teller window at a bank.

https://www.reddit.com/r/VirginiaTech/comments/1axey7q/johnny\_update/

He was recognized and ran off. He’s well enough to plan this and keep disappearing. People just never want to believe their loved one would voluntarily do something so dumb and make all sorts of excuses…but he did. He isn’t the first to be hiding things from his parents and won’t be the last.

No, it wouldn't

Just police. While OP probably has good intentions, you don’t know if OP is trying to find this person for malicious reasons or if individual in concern is actively avoiding them.

When I heard this story and first saw his picture, I will never forget the feeling I got when I looked at him. It still haunts me. I have been sending positive thoughts his way. I hope he understands that no matter how it seems right now, circumstances and people can change and he can get through whatever is challenging him at this time. I pray for both Johnny and his family.

One comment on facebook (not the post you linked) noted that given that his phone pinged near the NRV mall at 4:26 pm and he was traveling to Abingdon to take an online exam by 5 pm, there would be no way he would get there on time.

Cell phone "pings" are not always accurate. The process uses triangulation to find a location, based on signal strength returns from multiple cell towers (that's why cell towers have antennas pointing in three different directions). A signal is sent to a phone (which must be on to work) and the return signal is analyzed to determine rough distance and direction from multiple towers. Where lines intersect is the rough location of the phone. It can put a phone in an area but it isn't a sure thing.

With the comment below on the accuracy of cell phone pings, this gives me more clarification. Unfortunately, I feel like this will make it a lot harder to find him. I hope he is found safe.

He was recorded in security camera at bank in Christiansburg at 3:30pm on Friday. Looked like he was withdrawing cash

How do you know that he hung around?

I hope he ends up okay. I wish I could tell him no matter how bad he thinks it is, it will get better and he can have a great life. I hope he can feel the positive thoughts and hopes that are flowing his way.

I am not Aleah, just someone who saw her post and screenshotted to share :) not related to the family in any way, but Aleah is his sister!

Sounds like he told people he was going to do one thing and did something else. When I was an undergrad back in 1998 a grad-student vanished from VT after telling his roommates and several friends he was headed home to his parent's house in West Virginia for the weekend. I didn't know the guy but some of my friends did because he was their TA. The dude was last seen on security camera footage withdrawing $80 in cash from an ATM near the VT campus. After he didn't show back up at VT the following week he was reported missing. His car was found abandoned along the route he would have taken home in Fayetteville West Virginia about a mile from New River Gorge Bridge. Apparently the guy decided he had enough of this life and drove up there and parked his car and and jumped off. The whole area around the bridge and up and down the New River was heavily searched at the time but he wasn't found until 18 years later when workmen were clearing brush around the base of the bridge.

Hr and a half away

Yeah, the apartments he lived in are only 2 miles from the mall so his phone could have pinged a tower in that area while he (or his phone) was at his apartment. When I am at home my phone usually pings a tower about a mile away but occasionally I get calls showing up on my bill as having originated in a neighboring locality even though I know I was at home when I made the call.

They have posted a security camera pic of him at the bank in Christiansburg around 3:30pm on that Friday. And it looks like he withdrew quite a bit of money.

I think everyone gets what you’re saying but maybe try and have a little bit more tact in a post like this?

really not sensitive to post this story on an active missing persons case friend

Idk why you’re getting downvoted. Another kid JUST did this in Rochester ny. They, the college kids, should be fined for wasting resources and time.

He should be FINED? Are you fucking insane

Probably for pointing out that this is very unlikely to end with this dude being found alive and well. A 6'3" 230-240 lb. dude does not just disappear unless he wants to. Hard to fine someone who is dead but yeah, if Rob Kovack had just left a note in a sealed envelope on his desk before he "took the bridge" it would have saved a ton of resources that were spent looking for him after he vanished. They had helicopters flying up and down the New River Gorge, cadaver dogs and hundreds of VT students and other volunteers up there scouring the area looking for him. It also would have spared his family and friends from spending nearly two decades wondering what the hell happened him. Ironically while looking for him they found the remains of more than two dozen other people who had jumped off that bridge over the previous 21 years that it had been there but didn't find him.

Since people won’t clean up their trash, we did.

Thank you dude, you are truly the embodiment of Ut Prosim.

dude, you need to protect yourself.get gloves people who litter have worse hygiene. 🖖

God bless your soul, I hope you‘re blessed with extra meat in your next Qdoba bowl at no charge

Nice work. Hopefully this is a message to everyone. Don't litter. Besides obvious reasons - its disrespectful - to every HOKIE that ever walked across the Drillfield (thats alot of HOKIES) and especially the 32 memorialized there. GO HOKIES!

r/detrashed would like this :)

Thank you!!!! Blacksburg is too nice of a town to be treated like a wastebasket.

People can be so trashy

There needs to be more trash cans around the quads, but great work!

I like the comments. Ut Prosim, sir!

u/Zach10816 you a real one

You are goated sir

Good work man

Guys please stop giving me rewards it’s not worth it

Simply a young god, you are

Thank you for doing this, but you should probably be wearing a mask and gloves, especially since you're handling other people's garbage

Awesome gesture. Please wash your hands.

the best pic i’ve seen during my quarantine 😎

You should be wearing a mask right now. It’s almost like you want us to get sent home early...

Littering is basically putting your stuff down and forcing others to clean it up. It's selfish and narcissistic and I don't know how people live with themselves.

Yeah we used hand sanitizer after but you’re right we should’ve had gloves

Even worse at this point and time. People might have unwanted viruses left on the bottles and trashes. COVID-19 is different from other viruses in the way that it can survive on non-bio surfaces for over 32 hours in room temperature. Cleaning these up is unbelievable work but really helps especially considering how the house cleaners and other campus employee are pretty much overworked at this point.

It sends no message at all. People who litter either do it unintentionally or intentionally. For the former, it's often in the form of leaving food trash in the classroom after the tech talk is over. I think some people forget about it just because it's not "theirs". For the latter, it doesn't send them any message other than "it's someone else's job to deal with".

not quite ready to canonize anyone just yet.

We definitely used a lot of hand sanitizer after handling the garbage

Hokie Water

Better news than house parties

And you want praise for cynicism. At least picking up litter has a benefit.

Yeah? What's wrong with that?

You’re right we’re gonna be better next time

And a trash picker upper!

Glad to hear it :)

Too late, you already spread the virus. You killed grandma

Now you're getting all fancy.

Talk about fragile. A picture of a person doing a good deed makes you all defensive.

Uh, everyone? People like to feel appreciated. That's how humans work.

Ye chill though, they were doing a good thing.

Stop being a toxic cunt!

gotta-love all the monday morning amchair waste managers!

Your toxicity is not welcome here

Upvote if you actually wore this.

When i'm out of clean shirts, a shirt is a shirt

Free shirt is a free shirt

It’s a great shirt to cut the sleeves off for the gym

Ever, like at home, or in Blacksburg?

One of my go to shirts for center street

I got an XL size at the Hokie hi picnic and use it as a fantastic nightshirt

I still wear it lol. Usually avoided it when I was on campus though

If you wear a flannel over it you don’t notice ....

I still do but as PJs cause I got an XL

That was my laundry day shirt

no joke i haven't purchased a shirt at tech (2 yrs) cuz of free swag!

Second VT shirt I ever got, way back in ‘07, although ours were white instead of maroon. Definitely wore it until it faded out. I have it in a box somewhere with other shirts destined to be turned into a quilt.

I’m wearing mine rn... to bed

Never got one of these because I couldn’t make orientation #feelsbadman

Use it for work

I still wear it

Shit I still wear it

Still do, but only in my apartment.

Turned it into a tank top

I do when I paint and shit

I literally asked a chick on Tinder this today and even she couldnt give me a straight answer lol

Good job there. As really love that shirt. Lucky person

Got a pair that are 10 years old now still sitting in a drawer for house wear. Never gonna let go of them lol.

I never got mine lol

of course! it’s a solid shirt for laundry day or to sleep in.

Who tf pays for clothes in this day and age???

I'm only here for the shirt.

It was in my rotation when I was in school

i cropped it for game days lmao

I know all my gym bros made these into a cut-off shirt

Best party shirt

Everyone has worn it at least once.

I made it into a cutoff :D

You bet your ass I did.

I'm not gay, but twenty dollars is twenty dollars.

wearing that now haha

Exactly what I did lmao

I did that too lmao why has everyone done this

Ever, and in Blacksburg

I remember I did that when I was a freshman. One kind hearted dude told my buddy and I it's seen as a neon sign saying you were a freshman.

Home yes. Burg, never. Edit: But never in public.

You’re not a part of the club

This is the Perfect answer. Around town in Blacksburg HELL NO. Around town in home town? No thanks. How about at home in Blacksburg with roomies? Naaaaaa still too embarrassing of a shirt, we get it we all went to tech lol. How about around the house in your hometown that no one will see you in? Sure, a shirt is a shirt

You're not a part of the club

Haha tru tru, I’ll cry on the outside wishing I was on the inside

Its 4pm on a mid July, and the 2nd day of your orientation. Your group has spent the past 4 hours walking around campus in 90 degree heat, your orientation leader praising the math empo every other sentence. As you walk across the drill field the leader turns to the group. Perhaps it's finally over?

Them prepackaged meals slapped tho

Close to 5 years later and I can still feel the heat.

Here’s your gold because I can’t afford it 🏅

this is brilliant

As a parent: they put us in a room that was freezer cold and read the website to us. I napped on a couch in Squires instead.

Incoming transfer student, should I do this orientation? Sounds kinda miserable from this meme

Honestly I feel like building some parts of campus on roblox so people can do the orientation there.

‘24 are some lucky bastards for not having to go through this clownery

If you had to sit in a War room without A/C at 7:30 PM on the first knight and play “run to that wall if you ___”... you know

One of the good things about orientation being online this summer

Don’t forget then getting to sleep in a dorm room with no AC. Whole experience was awful.

The good thing about transfer orientation was that it only lasted half a day.

My orientation was 10+ years ago. Thanks for triggering my PTSD from that experience.

Something something something diversity!

We did rock-paper-scissor tournaments for like 3 hours

Cries in class of 2024

They don’t do the “what’s a hokie?” thing anymore. At least they didn’t at my orientation.

I never did orientation because my 'first' semester was summer two. Did get the *horrid* experience of staying in the hold o'shag in the middle of blistering summer, though. fuck

I am so happy that this is the 2nd post all time now. I love this school, and I love this subreddit.

Orientation felt like I joined a cult/went to Jesus camp. I remember walking to a seminar and having orientation leaders screaming and jumping. Poor introverted me was terrified. But those lunches were 👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻

Hey, can I borrow your cell phone? If you don't let me borrow it, I'm going to tell everyone you let me borrow it anyway.

We ate at D2. What’d you guys have

Hell yeah. It was worth the awkward forced conversation with my orientation group

The joys of being a transfer.

I remember trying to sleep in 90 degree heat on a bare mattress in Slusher. Shit was rough

back in my day it was uphill both ways

I will trade you the massive thunderstorm and having to walk from squires to the lane lot, getting while soaked and then having to sit in a frigid Empo trying to set your class schedule. I will take the heat over that any day.

Honestly the only useful part of orientation was having advisors from your major tell you the course requirements so you could make your schedule.

I miss being an unjaded freshman.

I believe orientation will be online this summer due to COVID-19

It's not that bad-- just make a friend or two in your group and you'll be having fun

I think transfer was only 1 day iirc. I want to say that is when they give you the classic tshirt

I transfered in when I was there and didn't attend an orientation. I'd recommend skipping it, there are plenty of resources available to help you without having to waste a day walking around hearing moto phrases.

It looks like orientation will be online, but if not then I highly recommend going. I met one of my best friends from orientation.

Hey, if it's an option, go for it! I met people there I'm still friends with.

It's a good experience. Just parts of it arent fun.

Transfer orientation was only a day thank god and not nearly as much PC culture shoved down our throats

https://i.imgur.com/26Nh1O5.png

says #2 for me

It was like a basic boxed lunch with chips sandwiches, cookies, fruit and stuff. I don’t know why but it still smacked

The awkward conversation was the worst. Why you trynna make me learn their life stories😭

Damn y’all suffered. Orientation groups sleep in the air conditioned cadet dorms now

I remember that. Guys got slusher wing while the girls stayed at slusher tower. During the night between the orientation, my group ended up playing spoons in the lounge area with a couple of drunk guys that wandered in.

Lee Hall here. Top bunk on a late July night with no air movement. Woke up in a pool of sweat at 6am after maybe sleeping for two hours.

If you walk from the residential side of campus to classes, it technically is (at least partially) uphill both ways.

Ours was at 7am and I fell asleep lmao

Dude i thought this whole thing sucked for me. Poor incoming freshman man what a way to start their college careers theyve been looking forward to. fuck

I never got a shirt

Virginia Tech beats Duke (82-67) winning first ever ACC Championship in Basketball!

Mike Young 🐐

Aluma and Cattoor brining us 50 points wow

Can't believe it man. What a team

Mutts is so hype in this celebration lol I love it. Just yelling "what's a Hokie? I am" right in Cattoor's face repeatedly

What’s been the most impressive to me during this 4 game run is that we’ve had production from each guy each night. Not just one player carrying the team.

We're a basketball school now apparently

Congratulations from a Tar Heel. Gutsy run through the whole tournament, and a great win tonight!

Does this mean we play in March madness?

WE DANCING!!! LETS GO!!

Basketball school? Basketball school.

Virginia Tech! Virginia Tech! VIRGINIA TECH!

[EXIT LIGHT](https://gfycat.com/confusedsilentamericanbobtail-basketball-college-ncaa-unc)

Congratulations Hokies from this Seminole. Very well done.

Looks like we are an elite basketball school now

Of course this happened during my gap year :p lol couldn't be happier for my Hokies!

Anybody know What seed are we likely to get?

We were 2-7 in ACC play on January 26. Now we’re on top. I LOVE THIS TEAM

[It was awesome being there! ](https://i.imgur.com/rVfJ0oh.jpg)

YEAHHH so hype

LETS GO HOKIES

Iceman MVP Cattoor and what a team effort!!!!

Let’s fucking goooooo

Damn. That's a pretty solid win.

First ever finals, first ever win. Hope we can make some noise in the tournament. We are going to be picked by a lot of people to make some big upsets.

LETS GO HOKIES!!!!

H.O.K.I.E.S. HOKIES!!!

Duke towered over us. Their players are so fast. Big congrats to the VT players for playing smart basketball, as well as congrats for the great coaching. I have no fingernails left.

Popcorn and cold drinks

Mike Hawk 🐐

I so loved Mutts' dunk toward the end that left Banchero on the ground. Oh, that felt so good.

Cattoor was absolutely insane, especially in the first half.

Cattoor played absolutely out of his mind last night!

This is the team I thought we were in November. Never expected this when the tourney started. Was at VCU for the final four run in 2011 and in the ACC tourney we showed a lot of the same qualities that that VCU team did in the NCAA. Let's keep it going

Mutts, storm, and aluma have been consistent all tourney. Maddox was off tonight but catoor was SO on. Maddox was ON each other night. They all can and want to carry the weight.

Ever since Frank left baby!

Tag team effort ruining Coach K's final big games. 🤝

In before they call us last 4 in

LETS FUCKING GO BRO

Yeah. They'll put us as a 16 seed against Gonzaga since they have to field us now.

This is the way

Protest today Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.

The BOV today called VT students “products”; also protesting the anti-DEI efforts. I’m proud of them!

I for one was pleased with the turnout at todays protest. The marchers were about 1/4 mi. long at 3 to 4 abreast. Quite a sizeable crowd. The 1st protest I've been to at VT since the "battle of blacksburg" may 1970 : I skipped high-school classes that day to attend, subsequently I got suspended for 3days. This protest today was a lot less confrontational, than back then, but I could certainty feel the energy today. Count me in to join you'all again. YOU'ALL DID YOURSELF PROUD❗️ DJT is wrong on so many things I can't count them all. I will rest easier when he's out of office❗️& not untill then.

I would've punted on the vote yesterday. Without the DOE who is even funding universities anyway. Why comply when that hasn't been figured out yet. But then again, the BOV is stacked with Youngkins picks.

I’ve seen more people go to watch two people punch on.

Everyone thinks theyre fucking MLK now. So fucking lame.

Wish I could have joined💗

Way to exercise your rights! Please continue to be free thinkers and question everything!

“Let’s go stand outside” That’ll show ‘em

42% of adults aged 18-29 voted.

Had a good time there

as long as it didn't turn violent then I hope ya'll had fun

I also hate that we no longer hire/promote based off of ethnicity, gender, or religion anymore. Civil Rights act of 1964 was a real let down.

It was really incredible to see so many people out yesterday!! I screamed a lot more than I intended to LMAO

I'm at a university which directly funds RSO's (including culturally focused ones), and they can always coordinate with its SGA to get more funding for their events. Honestly, I would rather these sorts of organizations be led by genuine grassroots students being funded by the university where necessary than being ran directly by the university itself. I mean, when white liberals from the outside try to dabble into this sort of thing, you get terms like "Latinx", which no Hispanic would ever have come up with. Would certainly give you a better outlook on a given culture when you learn stuff directly from international students themselves. Just goes to show that losing this office is far from game over. If you can convince the SGA to do the right thing, it may actually be an improvement. (If you're wondering why I'm here, my brother goes to VT, and I stay involved on his campus, also bc I want to visit it. There are certainly many things VT has that I could only wish my university had, but this is one of few areas in which mine wins out imo)

" the right of the people peaceably to assemble" unless there is a pandemic

Good showing, way to go VT.

Correct. But you also can't disrupt amor harrass the normal students and staff that are just trying to do what they are actually there for.

Why is everyone white?

ts beautiful 🥹

We won; you lost. Get over it and perhaps find a reasonably qualified likeable candidate in the next election with an IQ who doesn't push DEI BS and men in women's sports agenda, protests for more war and death in Ukraine, supporting terrorists, and advocates for more waste and abuse in already bloated bureaucracy. Thanks Elon! Democrats are getting crushed right now and look like a deer in the headlights. When the polls suggest or is trending that the leader for the Democrat party currently is a violent inciting, handicap shaming, and foul mouthed bitch by the name of Congresswoman Crockett you know the party is tanking.

Oh no, they have shut down the liberal indoctrination for a bit.

Those 77 people made a difference!

This isn't going to do anything

Like clockwork

That’s not very big. *That’s what she said.*

So does anyone know what they are protesting for?

Man it really must be hard living in a echo chamber, I’ve been in the middle not right or left focused on politics because if I was to choose I wouldn’t choose a group that was created by clan and still is ran by racist, so I have chosen to be republican because I believe in people’s character but recently the actions from the left for the past few years has been pure evil, free your minds make your own choices look beyond what they tell you and see the truth, some of you won’t but I believe that a few of you would

dang the USAID stash must be running out; that's not very many paid protestors

And how did the BOV vote after this?

It was a huge crowd! Does anyone have an estimate of how many showed up? My guess was about 375-400

Y’all should see how they treat their workers.

Is this right now? If so, why the hell do yall always protest in front of GLC. All you're doing by protesting in front of GLC is disturbing a bunch of undergraduate and graduate students who live there. Go protest somewhere like Burruss where yknow.. the President's office is? I don't care what the protest is about, imagine if there was a crowd of people in front of your house protesting? You'd be pretty pissed off too.

Dining hall food? Parking? Crappy music on WUVT FM 90.7 ?

Oh no people have to get in based on grades :(

Revoke all tax dollars sent to VT. Not with my money!

No one is establishing religion anywhere, WTF are they protesting about 😭

What law is particular are you protesting? It's not violating the 1st amendment whatever it is

What is this history I don't know about, the Battle of Blacksburg?

And once again protest a Country that allows freedom of speech, only because if you protest in most other countries you get thrown in jail. I hope everyone out there understands freedom is not free.

there's lots of continued action that was advertised during the speeches of the protest and that's been going on behind the scenes. i'm guessing you didn't bother to go to this, encampment, or any other protests that have gone on in the past year or you probably would've known that. so i ask, who's "we" and how are *you* making a difference. all for constructive criticism but this doesn't seem like it's from an informed or good faith place.

Yeah, that worked.

It's safer for international students to protest anti-DEI efforts since they won't be at risk of arrest by the ICE and deportation, unlike if they protest for Palestine.

Protests against the Muslim ban, the VT version of the March for science, the women’s march etc, take back the night, March for our lives, etc, have all been “just one protest for a little over an hour” and we’re still part of those movements.

Tech be like...

*That's a lot of damage!*

98% of that email was completely useless, all they did was jerk themselves off and then finally put in minimal useful information.

as a faculty member and someone who doesn't get the same communications as y'all, can i ask is this in response to the Student Affairs note that went out today?

Honestly I think they’re in the same boat as us. They have no clue how the semester is really going to look. All I know is it’s gonna be a trip of a semester

If they think people aren’t gonna party..... they’re gonna be sorely mistaken

Some communicator probably spent two weeks writing that letter. It’ll be the highlight of their career.

No, more so the letter that was sent out two days ago. Didn’t have much issue with the letter, other than the fact that it pretty much said nothing new and just reiterated what we’ve been hearing for the past few months.

Precisely this. Zero guidance or assistance from the national government. They're lost and are maybe not making the best decisions but they've been given zero direction from our president.

No No you don't understand, it won't be a party, all of my friends are just going to conveniently, accidentally, meet in the same location at the same time surrounded by a reasonable amount of alcoholic beverages

This is why there is no plan. There is no safe way to bring students back to campus.

Wait was this photo taken by the guy with a cute yellow lab? If so I walked past you taking this picture and I really wanted to say that your dog is super cute!

i’m screaming

I know one of the guys who runs the place; he absolutely has a good sense of humor. Great dude

Yeah but some of the quality of those movies are absolute trash

Nah, we just need one person with a Netflix account to screen share on Zoom

No, I took the picture. You may have seen me fiddle outside of The Cellar in the past.

Well you can probably stop now, it’s kind of early for that.

You've brought up some very good points in your argument. I especially like the one about one person with Netflix screensharing movies over zoom.

Welcome to Hoki, Tottori prefecture.

Fun fact: Japan has a town named Hoki. Japan does not have a town named cavalier or kabaliru.

This is awesome. Also you look very American lol

jealous - you should swing by Okayama and check out all the awesome denim spots there: https://japantoday.com/category/special-promotion/okayama-sunshine-and-denim

Do you know Japanese? I’ve just started learning from a textbook I bought off a fellow Hokie.

Awesome find!

Even without the jersey, Americans stick out in Japan. Especially in smaller towns like this.

Fun fact, the library has a room with full access to Rosetta Stone available to students.

I know enough to get by. Can speak / listen ok enough but can't read it at all. I suppose you could say I learned romaji.

You don't think I know that? Lol

Hah trust me I know. Rosetta is quite trash. For Japanese you can’t go wrong with the Genki textbooks. And you can get audio online for it. For Chinese I suggest a few apps to get started but first and foremost is constant practice with natives. HelloTalk is the app for that. Keeping a notebook and just getting your hands on good phrasebooks is my method and has worked great for Chinese.

Personally I know at least 15 words in Japanese as well as most of the honorifics from just watching subbed anime. I'd probably know more if I was actually trying to learn it.

Heh... I swear sometimes I feel like I may be the only dude learning Japanese who has no interest in anime or manga or any of that.

Epitome of Ut Prosim. May he Rest In Peace

Give this man a statue, or at least name a building after him

Has he been awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom? If not he needs to be.

He saved the life of my sister’s best friend as well as her first boyfriend. They jumped out the window because he held the door.

Him and the Cadet who won the Airman’s Medal (I believe his name was Mathew LaPorte please don’t kill me if Im wrong), deserve buildings named after them.

I’d much rather have librescu hall than new residence hall north north east west. I wish VT would start naming buildings after people who mattered. Not just whoever has the deepest pockets

Didn't donate enough money for a building./s

But they’re dead so how will they donate millions of dollars /s

Granata too. He left the safety of his third floor office to try and help people on the 2nd. Shooter never stepped foot on the 3rd floor.

I know this thread is old, but I was scrolling through the top posts in this sub. As a former cadet and a graduate of Matt LaPorte’s high school, I think it’s absolutely criminal that they didn’t name one of the new cadet dorms LaPorte Hall. If I recall, there was a strong petition to do so. It would’ve been a great way to honor him.

Or rename Lee Hall so it's not named after a clansman. But nah here at Virginia Tech the administration only says "Ut Prosim" when what they're serving is their wallets.

It's actually a really nice name

At the end of the day money matters the most lol.

His gave his life to and for VT, but apparently that’s not enough for VT.

A much older student of one of my advisors tried to donate half a million in the advisor's name to make a named professorship in his honor. It was amazingly generous of the dude, half a mil in cash??? Shit. He was worth $20-30 mil at this point if rumors were true, but still. VT told him they don't *do* named professorships for less than $1.5 million, and offered him some insulting nonsense like naming a conference room in the building. IIRC he left and never gave them a penny. VT ain't UVA rich, but they certainly aren't bothering with small change.

We're pretty sure my wife was one of the last people to see Kevin alive that morning. He came running into the area she was, raised the alarm, and then ran back the way he came to shuttle more people into safe areas despite his ability to get himself to safety. One of the worst days of my life, but Kevin and Liviu saved so many lives on that Monday morning. Not that I will manage it, but if I ever make millions, those two deserve their name on a building so many uncountable times over compared to faceless donors.

At least we named a lab after him

Fuck was Lee in the Klan?

I’m with you there. Pretty sure my cat would make a better president than Tim sands. Him and the other money grubbing fucks don’t deserve a place in university administration

Yep. The university claims that there's no "reliable evidence" that he was involved in "actual Klan activities" despite there being a yearbook naming him as a grand master or whatever in the KKK and despite there being records of his attendance at a lynching in southern VA.

Can you gimme the sources for that? That’s fucked up.

Here's a [Roanoke Times article](https://roanoke.com/news/education/virginia-tech-gives-dorm-namesake-s-possible-klan-link-another-look/article_4cecdad2-871d-5ed1-aafb-45aae7b5d105.html). Tldr the school claims that the numerous documents associating Claudius Lee with the KKK (a yearbook, several local news articles, etc) are "a nasty prank".

In my experience, when someone uses the word, "nasty" it's because they're dodging the truth, or over exaggerating. Source: Trump, and VT

I'd just like to know how claiming someone is part of the KKK is a "prank" when at the time, the KKK was regarded as a good and normal thing by the majority of whites.

Great start

This rebuild will last longer than War Memorial’s

Justin Fuente left us with nothing. Might be the worst season for us in a very long time. We don’t have much any talent.

You can’t win with 15 penalties and 4 turnovers. If we don’t improve this season, I’m not sure how we’ll win a single game.

[VT is currently 2-2 all-time vs ODspew](http://www.winsipedia.com/virginia-tech/vs/old-dominion)

Well at least tickets should be cheap this year.

I can't fucking believe it happened again. But also I totally can because what else would I expect

wErE A foOTbAlL sCHoOl

At the end of the day … I heard Pry is much better with the community and recruiting wise… it’s a new coaching change, he gets one losing season Imo. Beamer had losing seasons when he started.

Gonna be one long season.

VT should literally and unironically eliminate their football program and everyone that's ever been in the athletics decision-making hierarchy going back to the decision to hire Justin Fuente should be blackballed from the game forever

One day we’ll find a QB, one day…

Hello old friend

I feel bad for Brett Pry. What an awful start to a head coaching tenure

I just wanna know WHY he put in grant wells?

We’re a basketball school, the sooner we accept that…

All I saw was grant wells espn profile pic when they announced him as the starter and went “yup, we aren’t winning a game this year”

I thought this was in reference to the current state of the CpE program loo

Literally 10 years from David Wilson to... whatever this is.

In the same season, I sat in Lane when we lost to JMU. Then watched us win the ACC. I know this team isn’t deep, and there’s a long ways up- but it’s not over

I haven’t been on campus in nearly 2 years; is War Memorial gym *still* closed?

Pry just needs to take all of his time recruiting this season. Can’t really do much with the players he has now.

JFs gone - Hatin on him does no good Its a rebuild and its gonna suck - starting with Game 1

Move over UVA, we found our new in-state rivals.

Not anymore

Dude, it's going to take a lot longer than 1 season to come back from this.

The contract extension was much worse than the original hire. This was always going to be a rebuilding year and one game is one game, but I just don't see how we can compete in the ACC with the level of talent we have now. And the ACC is weak.

>VT should literally and unironically eliminate their football program That damn near happened back in 1986 after the VT athletic scandals that happened under Bill Dooley.

nah its not *that* bad. Our defense was actually solid for most of the game and we're in a pretty deep rebuild. If our new qb and wrs dont improve, they need to be sacked.

They should have kept Fuente and let him play out his contract instead of letting the ignorant fans run him out the building. "Fire Fuente" chants were the rock bottom of this program and your seeing the results.

We did find one a few years ago - his name was hendon hooker. Sadly he was ran off by the coaches and now looks like a heisman contender

It gets better if you stop caring.

Out of the loop. What's wrong with the cpe program

Indefinitely as well :(

It's open now, but they are still doing work on it.

The players lurking the subreddit rn: 🥲

Our defense looked solid because ODU's QB was one of the worst I've ever seen play for an FBS team.

Their defense looked okay because its ODU, would wait til they face an actual team to see if the D can hold up...

>If our new qb and wrs dont improve, they need to be sacked. Our qb transferred from a sun belt conference team and just lead us (with 4 interceptions) to a loss against a different sun belt conference team. Can't wait to see how he stacks up against the ACC Why do tech qbs always suck smh

Yes I remember that viral 'KEEP FUENTE' thread that you started last season - that was Epic. (/s)

Fuente should’ve been gone after the 2020 covid season. He never even should have got the extension

Facts, I miss the “hooker time” t-shirts and the hype around that dude.

Its the cpe program

I feel bad for all the people on campus who still need to go all the way out to a perpetually-packed McComas for a workout… I remember it being a trek just to get there from Pritchard, let alone the dorms near Vawter.

It's really just the skill positions. Defense is ok, O-line gave our QB a decent amount of time, and the rungame was passable.

Agreed. WVU will put up 80 on this squad.

Fair. I still think Pry is the right move, though. There weren't any major coaching mistakes this game, and talent takes time to develop.

true lots of arm tackling and the many PI penalties shows the DBs can't cover at all

If only we had a QB whisperer coach that could reinvigorate our program! Oh wait, that was supposed to be fuente...

Just wait until you graduate

Wan really does kinda suck more than before. Especially the broccoli. There’s literally brown dots and mush on the stems of half the broccoli I get there now

no fried rice

Was that the place there before? I heard they ruined Owens coming into this year.

Whether you dodge a bullet by pulling out some gnarly karate moves or by slipping on a banana peel, you still dodged the bullet.

It can be, but the current "standard" is a terrible mess. But it's not all bad if you are willing to go against the grain a little.

Tbh the only slightly inaccurate part are the insanely packed fitness classes at McComas. By week 6 they’re back to normal.

Everything else though is like tooooo relatable. 8 am labs while hungover on a Friday morning trying to make it through the vortex that is the drill field. Getting a fantastic frank and/or freshens (sp?) smoothie after your last class a few times per week. Showing up 5 minutes late for your lecture at McBride 100 and awkwardly finding a seat. That being said.....take me back

Fill out one of those dining services feedback cards. They take those really seriously in regards to actual actionable feedback.

Hey, I work at Owen's as steamer for that said same broccoli. It's the same source as Bowl Dynasty's broccoli, maybe the steamer didn't cook it well that day? Sorry for that.

Bingo. Only dry noodles

“The haters said it couldn’t be done. And they were right. Honestly great call from the haters.”

My thoughts exactly

Great quote. My new life motto.

"Veni, Vidi, Fuimus asinum." ["We came, we saw, we were ass."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xMGRA_FePw)

I’d give it an Ass +

This is the correct assessment.

If he wanted to win, he should've never left VCU for VT. Everyone knew they were going to be ass. And, yes, they were that bad...mainly by turning it over way too much.

I want to cross-stitch this.

This sums it up…this was the hardest team to watch in a long time. Was just ugly basically 80% of the time. How we are not rethinking our coach is beyond me. He seems like a good coach, but we are failing huge in recruiting and transfers- that is the entire job. Saying I dont have enough NIL money is an excuse. We were not even a top 100 team this year. Plenty of teams above us with far less money.

Actually what you wrote is "\*I\* came, \*I\* saw, we were ass." You got the first person past perfect right, but you needed it in the plural. Also, "fuimus" takes the nominative as its object rather than the accusative, so you want "asinus." Or, better yet, "gluteus" if you wanna say that we were ass, and not just donkeys. You want "Venimus, vidimus, fuimus gluteus." Finally, 25 years later, those three semesters of Latin at Virginia Tech came in handy. Thanks, Professor Beck!

He followed his coach who took a chance on him with little basketball playing experience when he came to the states in high school. He trusts he will develop him into an NBA prospect and it sure is projecting that way

yeah Rewarding mediocracy with obscene amounts of money is always the answer.

Eh, there were some extenuating circumstances in the recruiting/NIL realm this past season. I’m sure there’s somebody who knows the full details better than me, but as I recall we had one crucial transfer that was expected to start that was declared ineligible due to some gambling issues at his last program. Then there was another projected starter that decided to reenter the portal shortly before the transfer period ended, which left the coaches unable to find someone else in time. I’m inclined to give the coaches at least a little bit of a pass for this season.

Do we not remember that we lost our entire starting 5 and we had a PG de-commit at the last second plus another good player released due to gambling scandals? He has no support from the front office, and the only reason we were not complete ass is because of him.

You do not know what you’re talking about

Losing the starting PG within a week of the start of the season didn't help.

Why the fuck are you getting downvoted lmao

That quote is anything but mediocre. I say $2 mil in NIL

Results are all that matter- that is all just excuses. Committing to athletes that don’t show up and not having contingencies is a failure of the coaching staff. 3 years of no NCAA bids in a row with losing acc records in those years. That is not a program that is improving- it is the worst team in his tenure. I guess the good news is that it is hard to get worse then this.

Because it’s a silly opinion. VT has been behind most schools in money way before the NIL, we returned 1(?) starter from last year, and aren’t able to pay to recruit higher caliber players. Coaching isn’t the issue, it’s Whit Babcock and saying anything other than that is full blown oblivious.

Correction: Rewarding a very talented athlete who played well below his potential this year millions of $s for a better-than mediocre quote is always the answer.

Meanwhile some school you’ve never heard of will make the sweet 16 this year. But ok sure

It has been 3 years of no tourney bid. By all standards that is bad. We were not a top 100 team- that is horrible. Teams make that lost with no fucking NIL. I like the guy- but he is not producing and we have been getting worse for 3 seasons.

That’s why they are called Upsets and Cinderella runs, because it’s a team that has no business being there, and gets extremely lucky and you never hear of the again. Remember Loyola Chicago? How have they been doing since there final four run?

Wow, I’m sure that same school probably had equally as hard of a schedule. And will go equally as far next year. FAU In the 23 tournament they made an incredible elite 8 run and then in 24 got absolutely cream pied in the round of 64. But you’re right one off random streaks are an AMAZING judge of a program.

You should clarify that you mean NCAA tournament and you must be in your early 20s since you don't remember the 90s-00s.

I promise you it can be worse, it’s not a coaching issue. Switching coaches is only going to exacerbate the problem. Whit is a dogshit athletics director and it’s the reason why ALL of our programs not just basketball are crumbling. And for the record you are hella spoiled if you think 3 years without a tourney bid is awful. I lived the James Johnson era of VT ball, and this isn’t even remotely close to that level of shitshow.

VTPD Last Night I would like to take a moment to appreciate VTPD last night for their calm and collected approach to making their arrests and not allowing the situation to escalate. One student from within the encampment was live-streaming and it showed multiple VTPD officers handing out waters to the protestors (who took the water while actively hurling insults at the very same officer handing them the water). They clearly and calmly answered any and all questions about why they were being detained and exactly what rules were being broken, all while students called them fascists and pigs inches from their faces. When the live-streaming student was detained, the officers calmly asked him to stand up to be handcuffed and explained his rights and what he was being detained for, and also assured him it was his right to continue recording if he wanted to. All while the student was screaming in their faces calling them fascists, pigs, saying they should be ashamed for doing their jobs. As we have seen all over the media and some of us in real life, some police officers will escalate situations like these for whatever reason. VTPD kept the situation under control and didn’t allow any insults to push them into escalating a situation like some shitty cops do.

Saw a girl in GLC posting on the 2027 snap story about how loud it was at 2 AM. Feel bad for anyone who lives there trying to sleep or study

Cops did a great job last night actually. They kept everything from escalating and there was a bunch of people there last night that came to riot, hell there was even a couple who were actively trying to get people to rush the police line.

Despite all the horror stories about police, one should realize that the majority of them are simply people living their lives, doing their jobs to earn a wage to support their loved ones and families. (I am not in any way or ever have been affiliated with any law enforcement agency.)

Sometimes I wish good cops got more exposure. VTPD has always been well-received, cordial, and up front in what they do. Every time I've encountered both VTPD and Blacksburg Police, they've been friendly and are mainly looking out for the students and community.

I’m not usually one to go out of my way to support cops or police officers. It’s definitely a broken system that needs to be fixed on many levels. But that’s a whole other thing. But I have never had a poor experience with VTPD. They have always been great and genuine.

2008 grad here. I love seeing love for the VTPD, and am glad they’re maintaining the “quiet professional” mentality that they did during our chaos.

I'm usually full ACAB, but I definitely respect the police for keeping their composure and not letting things escalate. From the stream and videos, they weren't shoving people to the ground or beating them to compliance, I don't even think I saw one person wrestled into cuffs. Cops didn't go out there in riot gear ready for a fight either. They went in, announced they were going to start arresting people, gave them a chance to leave on their own, then set up a perimeter of the illegal gathering and moved in slowly and methodically as the protesters sat and waited to be cuffed and put in a van. With that said, this should be the baseline of what's expected out of police. Instead, our baseline is more violent across the country. It's expected for people to get beat and for many to end up injured or in the hospital on both sides.

I appreciate -- I REALLY do -- that the cops last night kept their calm and treated everyone with professionalism and respect. I would like to see more of that from policing in the United States. But I do take issue with the overall tone of this post and I think it's worth calling it out. Perhaps unintentionally, /u/lizthekidig seems to be suggesting that these cops went above and beyond their duty in their composure last night. This could not be further from the truth. Police enter every interaction with the ability to bring overwhelming deadly force to bear. Not only that, but the legal structures that surround their profession excuse and, in many cases encourage them to lean on that. The VT cops last night -- armed with tazers, night-sticks, zip-ties, and handguns -- faced peaceful protesters armed with words. They didn't crack any skulls or shoot anyone, true, but if we regard that as admirable we may as well be congratulating an NFL linebacker for not choosing violence when a 6 year old fan tells him he sucks. Yes, VT police acted with professionalism and compassion while carrying out their duties last night. But we should **always** expect that of police. It should not be exceptional when that happens; it shouldn't even warrant mention. Just as we would expect a waiter not to spit in our food or a plumber not to flood our house, we should expect a police officer handle their job and the awesome responsibility it entails without resorting to unnecessary violence. Yes, some unkind things were said about those officers. But, if you've ever been in a retail or food-service establishment you'll know that unkind things are often said to people just trying to do their jobs in those places as well. We don't congratulate retail and food service workers for not beating, tazing, or shooting the customers and we shouldn't congratulate cops for showing the same restraint.

I can tell you, being a public servant is one of the worst jobs in this country right now and it doesn’t stop at being a police officer. It is so hard to show constraint and not stoop to peoples levels. Remember that PD are still underpaid public servants, the internet has done a really good job of absolutely dehumanizing everyone that works in government and enforcement. You couldn’t pay me enough to take their job right now, and it’s a necessary one regardless of how people feel about it.

Kudos to the police for getting them TFO.

Everyone has a right to protest their beliefs. But acting out in a way where you’re screaming at people for DOING THEIR JOB, get a grip.

Holy shit this generation is DOOMED. Of course protestors did not want to be removed from the lawn, it’s called a PROTEST for a reason. I cannot give props to a department or administration that removes a peaceful protest for any reason. Everyone here is acting like it’s totally unjustifiable that anyone on the lawn stayed after whatever arbitrary time VT posted they should leave by. Do none of you understand the meaning of civil disobedience? This is a huge failure from VT to not engage at all in any discourse with the protestors who have very real and reasonable demands. It seems a great majority of the VT populace is totally fine with Tech’s resources going to companies that enable genocide.

Free Palestine

I graduated 8 years ago but these “protestors” are an embarrassment and a stain to the Tech brand. Thankfully, the administration is much more rational than other universities and shut this down pretty quickly.

i mean if the police are going to violate my first amendment right to peacefully protest i would really only care if they did so calmly or not. vt is spitting out some S tier centrists.

students are enraged and they have a right to be. i have the right to be upset at police for stoping a peaceful protest. i have the right to be upset that these police, whether it's their job or not, are acting against something that is important. they, the police, will always be wrong in a situation as such in my eyes. i was there last night. i agree the police were calm for the most part. however, there were multiple officers that taunted us on squires lawn. removing free palestine posters for no reason, waving the flag and other posters at us and laughing as they bring it back to their car. i ask why? why did you behave in such a manner? why did you remove those? they weren't in your way. why did you kick and shove peoples personal belongs for no reason? literally no reason at all. you may not agree with me. and i do not mind that you don't. i stand firmly that those students should have been left to continue protesting, especially when they weren't being disruptive or violent in any way at all. some mention that us in squires lawn "came to riot." we did not. we came to be loud and show our solidarity with the protesters and to make sure vtpd knows we do not agree with them. history has its eyes on us, and you can choose to be on whichever side you wish to be. on the side of liberation or on the side of oppression. your choice.

so we’re praising cops for doing the bare minimum…

Ty for doing your job 🥱

Yes the fascists were nice about it so let's thank them as they take us to the gulag. Good fucking lord some people...

Everyone keeps acknowledging VTPD but what nobody realizes is that last night was coordinated with multiple agencies. Montgomery sheriff PD, State PD, VTPD and Blacksburg PD was all on scene

You can blame Sands and the police for that. Protesters would have been asleep if the VTPD were not actively arresting people at that hour. It was also the police who kept their spotlights and flashers on until the early hours of the morning. Also, while the protest had been going on for days and the police had been on scene for days, it took them until late at night to be prepared to move on the encampment. Even then, they lacked sufficient numbers of police, as well as equipment to deal with it with any kind of efficiency. They had to leave multiple times to secure civilian vehicles for transport. They ran out of flex cuffs once or twice. They did not have magistrates on hand to process arrestees. By six am, a number of arrested protesters were given court summons and released (couldn't have just planned to do that from the beginning?) after being kept awake all night with hands flex cuffed behind their backs. In contrast to the disorganized and unprepared VTPD and in direct contrast to the spurious pretense of 'public safety' concerns, the protest was well organized and exceedingly safe. There was no violence. There were no drugs or alcohol or intoxicated persons. There was ample food, water, sunscreen, and medical supplies. Food was labelled properly and stored safely. There were hygiene and hand washing stations. Many wore covid masks, up until arrests began, because any face covering can lead to a felony charge in a protest. There were multiple medics and legal observers on site, clearly identifiable by their clothing. In their crusade for 'public safety' the first act of the VTPD was to arrest one of the medics. There was literally less than zero threat to public safety before the police action. I say less than zero because there were actual medical personnel and supplies, so the area was technically safer than under normal unoccupied circumstances. The only public safety issue here was the police action. And, yes, they could have been much worse in executing their orders. The cop who was giving out water was not unfriendly, but he also did not hesitate to arrest and incarcerate peaceful protesters. I know a lot of decent humans who are law enforcement, and we can love and respect each other as human beings, but they know how I feel too. When we say ACAB, part of what we mean is that there is no way to be an active agent of an incarceral state and still be the good guys. Finally, one of the pretenses being reported as basis for breaking up the camp was that the lawn had been reserved through proper channels for an event yesterday. Despite protesters, many of whom had been kept awake and cuffed all night, returning to clear and fully clean up the lawn early in the morning, the lawn remained empty all day, surrounded by police tape and unusable by any students. So, while I am glad that the police were mostly polite and were not more violent, let's not pretend like they were not the sole source of problems and the sole reason for disturbance until the wee hours. Shame.

I'm just glad no one got hurt. Y'all have the right to protest, but be reasonable about it. I watched Officer Crouse die in 2011 on campus from some crazy shit and we don't need any more of that. Be respectful, stand for what you believe in, be safe. That's it. We are all just people at the end of the day trying to do the best we can. Students and officers included.

You seem well-intentioned, but this is a childish perspective. You could say that about the rubber-stamping insurance claim specialist who leaves months between your cancer diagnosis and your treatment. They're just clocking in and clocking out, following procedure. You could say that about the guy pressing the button to launch the missile that kills your family, too. He's just some soldier trying to get his college paid for. It wasn't his idea. All of us are "simply people living our lives." Your choices matter in them because every simple person has the capacity to cause harm or prevent it. If you choose to participate in a violent system, it is rational and fair to hold you accountable for those choices. Why do you think so many doctors refuse to participate in death penalty executions? What about the My Lai massacre? Do some cost-benefit analysis. Palestine doesn't even have an army, Israel is a nuclear power with leaders expressing openly genocidal sentiment. VT is a massive funnel for the armed forces and for the companies that *we as Americans pay,* via donation of our tax, to send arms to a nation with an openly legislated apartheid system. I sincerely do not understand how you can see this as anything other than state repression of students' free speech.

All cops are complicit

I remember one time I talked to them to report something suspicious that I thought could lead to some harm to students (fortunately nothing bad happened) and they carefully explained to me why what I was saying wasn't within their jurisdiction and they couldn't do anything about it, but then made sure to have an officer call me back to tell me every option I had to ensure the students involved were safe and went out of his way to make sure I knew I was doing the right thing. Other jurisdictions usually just brush off cases outside of their jurisdiction and make you feel stupid for even saying anything

Yeah, I literally watched a girl on the lawn last night leave the group to run over to her closed bag, open it, pull something out, and run back over to the crowd. The officers all turned and stared at her and went “oh you’re coming back? What do you have in your hand?” And the girl went “ha ha I just needed a marker” and the cops said “don’t run over to bags without telling us what you’re doing next time”. Cops with less of a level head or situational awareness skills could have shot that girl for potentially getting a weapon out of her bag, as we’ve seen happen all the time with traffic stops other police encounters shared on the internet

No, I agree that they did the literal bare minimum of their jobs by treating the people they are sworn to protect and serve with respect and dignity. I just think that with how often the horrible abusive cops are highlighted in media, the ones who do their jobs correctly should also be highlighted. Especially with VTPD who almost solely serve the Virginia Tech campus, I think it’s important to acknowledge that most of those particular officers are some of the good ones who do their jobs correctly. On a college campus where students may need to reach out to VTPD to report a crime, to ask for help, or even ask for a ride home with their Ride Safe program, it’s important to me to recognize that these particular cops WILL treat you will respect and that students here can still rely on them to help and protect them.

I think part of the reason police feel the need to be so heavily armed is because of the whole police vs public issues occuring across the US right now. Not defending the police in their choices of what to bring to a protest by any means, it's definitely accessive, but based on recent events, crowds have become more unpredictable than protests throughout history.

I feel so bad for anyone who lives in GLC trying to study/sleep/work on their thesis who were kept up until at least 3am

With civil disobedience comes the acceptance that you can and will be arrested for disobeying. That’s part of what makes protests so powerful, that they are willing to risk being arrested or attacked by police for the cause. I was just highlighting that our particular police force handled the situation very calmly, which cannot be said for police in other college campuses where similar protests are taking place

Do they not teach people anything at school anymore? People live in the GLC. They were being loud and obnoxious. They were asked to leave, they said no. Pretty simple stuff.

This protest is dumb. Even though the atrocities committed by Hamas on Oct 7th don't justify the degree of the Israeli bombing campaign of Gaza, which has resulted in unnecessary civilian casualties, what is occurring in Gaza is not genocide. The IDF are not rounding up Palestinians going back to their bombed out homes in northern Gaza and firing squadding them into mass graves like the Einsatzgruppen did to the Jews of Eastern Europe. The apartheid that is happening in Gaza and the West Bank is wrong and should be addressed. Calling the IDF conduct genocide though is where this movement is losing public support.

Protesters not “protesters” & this is what free speech looks like. It’s pretty wild that the police got involved at all

They should not have to be but right now they kinda have to be. By acknowledging this it helps to bring it a spotlight to how cops act and encourages them to act the way they should. I talk about the issues with the current American police regularly, but at the end up of the day we need some kind of police force trained and professional in public protection. You bring up capitalism, and I dislike American capitalism as much as the next guy, it’s terrible. But I’m pretty sure every country has some form of police, and need we one too. So, in an effort of improving the police force nationwide, we should recognize when they act correctly, not only abhorrently.

Hey buzzword jockey, go be a shitty alum somewhere else

So many complaints about capitalism, it’s very easy to live somewhere else…

Complains about capitalism while typing on a phone compiled from cheap labor lol.

Your right to protest doesn’t mean you’re allowed to break other laws in the process, it just means they can’t arrest you for the words you’re saying

“The side of liberation or oppression” Jesus Christ you think your in a Marvel movie. You play geopolitics like a fucking musical. I can’t believe someone like this makes it into VT

So stunning, so brave. Thank you for shouting at the clouds and creating real change in Gaza. We shall all remember you for generations to come.

When the majority of media attention given to police these days is demonstrating the shitty, abusive cops hiding in plain sight? Yes.

Any time I see people label others as “nazis,” “fascists,” or “commies,” I immediately know they don’t know what they’re talking about and resort to emotional rather than logical discussions in their daily life.

Can’t confirm if true, but read in another thread the protesters had an allotted time on the GLC lawn and were notified that action would be taken if they stayed past that time. Apparently the protesters decided instead to call in more people to stay past said time, which regardless of side is clear antagonization and destroys their credibility (if true). Would appreciate if someone can corroborate/correct/refute this

My Aerospace Engineer Roommate Got This For Our Apartment

That reminds me of a joke they published in the collegiate times when I graduated. Four engineers are in a car driving. One Mechanical, one chemical, one electrical, one computer scientist. Car breaks down. Mechanical engineer: I heard the engine straining and we need to replace the pistons Chemical: no you heard that because something clearly got into our gas tank and has contaminated our fuel. Electrical: it’s the alternator. It needs to be replaced. Everyone looks at the computer science major who says: “Well, maybe we all get out of the car and get back in?” Kills me every time

I remember being an undergrad and really getting offended by this. My goto defense was ,"well I'm in the College of Engineering too and I take more math classes than you guys." That wasn't much of a defense and my other engineering majors weren't convinced of the rigor of my major. But then I got multiple job offers with salaries starting above $100,000 while all the other engineering majors were lucky to get one in the mid 70s, and then I quickly stopped giving a shit about what people thought of the difficulty of my major. The vast majority of the time, CS majors win in the end.

Well..there’s software engineering.....

I got banned from club penguin for saying “sup fuckers” smh

My son loves that! Where can I buy one?

That looks oddly familiar 🧐

I'll propose an unpopular position: Computer Science is mostly engineering, w/o the rigor of the other engineering disciplines. (I mean, there is rigor in the classes/topics, but what CS people do day-to-day is "let me try this approach; measure it; then tweak and try again". Without the protocols and procedures that other, licensed, engineers have to go through, to show rigor.) [Sure, Theoretical Computer Science stands on its own, but that's not what 95% of practicing software engineers do.]

Software engineering was an engineering practice before agile took over! As a SE graduate I agree that SE and CE are very different with other engineering practices. Almost all other engineers use same laws of physics and math they were using 100 years ago , that’s not the case with SE it changes every few year

I was going to say that there's a PE Software exam, so I could consider whoever went out of their way to get certified as a software engineer as an engineer. [Then I learned that the PE Software exam was discontinued.](https://ncees.org/engineering/pe/software/) So yeah, software engineering is not really engineering.

I do “software engineering”

CS majors trying to prove they're real engineers when the last physics class they took was 2306

Jesus Christ that must’ve hurt for that 1/3

Two engineers are meeting in the park for lunch. One arrives on a bicycle the other doesn't recognize. "Where'd you get the bike?" he asks. "Well it was the weirdest thing. A woman rode up to be on it, hopped off, tore off her clothes and said 'take what you want!' So I took the bike." "Good call," the other said, nodding. "The clothes probably wouldn't have fit."

What did the ISE major say?

The funny part too is that these days cars have [millions of lines of code](https://www.quora.com/How-many-lines-of-code-are-in-a-car), though it wasn't too long ago when cars had zero lines of code lol.

This is what makes me laugh when I see these. I'm working in a dual environment making 6 figures out of college loving my job with flexible hours lots of paid leave and great benefits and all my ae friends are overworked making barely 70. Work smart not hard

I mean nobody can shit on anyone in the college of engineering because all of you guys make good money so

That's the joke

> Without the protocols and procedures that other, licensed, engineers have to go through to show rigor. You mean security standards and protocols? A lot of physical science engineers don’t see software engineers on the same level because anyone can put anything online but not just anyone is allowed to build a road or a car. But simply publishing a piece of software means nothing. Building software for banks, or governments, or any software that moves physical objects, it all has professional licenses and organizations and procedures.

They have test engineers and system analysts for that

Former software engineer of 10 years, current electrical engineer of 10 years. Would definitely say if you get a PE, it's real engineering. Computer engineering, also real engineering. Software engineering, very valid career path, but it did seem like "advanced problem solving."

Marchman took no prisoners.

To be fair, Tech does offer Computer Engineering and Computer Science as separate majors. There is still a lot of programming in Computer Engineering but it puts more focus on hardware.

I was somewhat joking. The only reason the software engineering PE test was discontinued was lack of people taking it, not lack of legitimacy as an engineering profession. That's kind of the rub, though. From my understanding, the rigor of the PE is there in cases where someone needs to be there to sign off that a system or artifact will not fail. Generally, these are situations in which failure has dire consequences for human life. There are certainly cases in which human life is at risk in case of software failure, such as medical devices, but they are rarities. There are more commonly cases where the economic cost is great, but the economic cost of demanding rigor would be far greater. The economics of the situation demand that software development not be a rigorous field. There could potentially be a discipline of "software engineering" that services those life critical situations, but its practice would have some radical departures from current practices to allow a person to stake their career on a piece of software not failing when someone's life is on the line. I say all this as someone who graduated with a degree in mechanical engineering, but has been a software developer since graduating and has the job title software engineer.

Yep, absolutely

This is an excellent point of view. I have my PE, and recognize it's largely superficial in most careers/industries. I also recognize that software engineering isn't just a cakewalk. It's not easy in any way shape or form. It's just different. One major difference I experienced working in two careers is that software engineering changes and adapts much faster than physical forms of engineering. Some of the core concepts will always be true... but to remain on the cutting edge, there is a greater emphasis on new technology, with a much shorter half life. In mechanical engineering, torque is torque, and an electrical ohm's law will never change. But the way software is constantly being rewritten in different languages and through different methodologies, (i.e. quantum computing), it requires a different set of ever-changing skills.

> cases in which human life is at risk in case of software failure And most of these cases are under the umbrella of control systems, which still has its own PE exam. The weirdest thing about controls is that despite the importance placed on safety and reliability, unit testing is still a pretty foreign concept.

The fast past learning and change is one of the reasons the pay is so good for CS Compared to traditional civil engineers, etc.

I think in this case, market demand dictates rates. I left my Software career behind after 10 years not only because I was being outpaced by recent college graduates or prodigies that were learning on newer platforms (I was unwilling to spend all my spare time learning said new platforms) but also because they were coming to the industry at much lower pay levels than established. I was in the low 6 figure range and people were coming in with quicker more adaptable skill sets in the 60k-70k range (this was 2004 or so.) That said, I do love the demand that exists for Electrical Engineers currently! Fewer of us than most, and even fewer that go into construction consulting.

CS Majors should definitely get a minor in ECE Cyber and a Math Minor. I tilted my career to cyber 6 years ago. There is generally a point where a person’s skills elevate them to where they’re not best positioned playing an instrument, but conducting the orchestra. By that, I mean managing.

This really opened my eyes

Ryan you really had to give him all of your awards, huh?

Who vomited awards all over the post?

Glad to see the gospel being shared on the drillfield

I assume this is a pledge thing?

I think they secretly have a fetish and really hope a girl will prove them wrong. I'd just roll up with my phone and show them two girls one cup. Boom.

Pretty sure the Hahn garden shows how successful Virginia Tech's horticulture program is. That and all the successful alumni in the horticulture industry across the US. The drillfield is.. a field. Not a golf course. The Hort Dept has nothing to do with it.

Doctor here. That’s actually really incorrect. Can’t tell if you’re serious or just joking around so let me educate. Girls actually do have anuses, much like men still have nipples. Girls just can’t pee and poop. You see, pee and poop are stored in the balls, that’s why you have two of them. You can figure out which one is which by punching yourself as hard as you can in one testicle and seeing what comes out.

Could be technically true if pledging.

yup, there are a few of us.

Him: yo girls got anuses Them: na fam Him: bruh

Also the drillfield is trampled over by cadets doing their cadet things, students going to class, bikes, and more... what exactly do they expect the horticulture department to do about that lmfao...

How are your right? It’s called a drought.

>You can figure out which one is which by punching yourself as hard as you can in one testicle and seeing what comes out. Which one is red?

Username checks out

Name checks out

I'm just picturing Sands sending all the Hort professors onto the drillfield to patrol it and keep students off the grass OR ELSE. And the profs go and kind of wander around but eventually end up planting gardens and building small greenhouses in random locations or making wildflower arrangements or admiring tree bark and giving out extra credit. Might be kind of nice actually.

To the blonde driver of a sky blue Volkswagen Beetle I (brunette in the silver Dodge Charger) went to the Starbucks on Main St. today and got my order at around 1:40 from the drive-thru. I let in a blonde driver of a sky blue Volkswagen Beetle go in front of me in the drive-thru line after three cars didn’t let her in. When I pulled up to the window to get my order, the cashier told me that the person in front of me had paid for my order. I just wanted to say thank you so much to whoever the driver was. That made my day and I am still shocked and heart-warmed at what happened. In the middle of this COVID-19 crisis, you restored my faith in humanity. Thank you so much for your random act of kindness! We need more people like you in the world! ♥️

Lmao title had me thinking it was gonna be the complete opposite tone

Thanks for the wholesome, OP 💜

To OP, no hon, we need more people like YOU in the world. Patience when in a car does wonders to everyone's peace of mind :)

I, welcome these wholesome moments

>Brunette with a charger Marry me?

The hokie community makes me proud everyday. If only the administration of VT felt like behaving towards the rest of us the way we tend to treat one another.

Did you pay it forward?

How many people did she cut in line, besides you? Was she good looking? A lot of people like that truly consider the time in their lives to be more valuable than the rest of us.

Me too. I was convinced this was going to be a "you slammed your door into my car, and didn't leave insurance information." But then it was so much more wholesome. Made me smile. :)

Oh god I see what you mean; my bad!! 😂😝

I was expecting the them to have left their lights on

SAME LMAO Karen was ab to pop offf

Anyone else kinda disappointed? I can't be the only one. /s

Aw, thank you so much— you’re the sweetest! ♥️

Preach, Hokie! ♥️👏🏼

I honestly should’ve. I didn’t think to do it at the time because I was taken aback, but I think I’ll go ahead and go back tomorrow and tip the cashier the cost of my order or something like that.

I’m sorry in advance if I misunderstood your point, but what I’m hearing is that she inherently wanted to cut in front of people because she thought she was superior and deserved special treatment (basically a Karen). I’m going to immediately jump to her defense on this one. There were two entrances to the drive-thru line and she had been waiting very patiently for a long time to get in from the second entrance. She had just as much of a right to enter at the time that the cars ahead of me did, but they simply ignored her and didn’t let her in. I fail to see how her looks may have influenced my decision to let her in...

You sound like an incel buddy

I came for coffee, not to pay a deductible! Just kidding, enjoying the wholesome posts!

👍🏽👍🏽 Or just buy for the person behind you next time you hit the drive thru. Maybe it'll start a chain. Ive seen this happen for hours sometimes with people buying for the next person, or at least until the last person in line.

Ok, well I don't know what this dual entrance drive thru is, but the OP makes it sound like he let her cut the line.

??? Why would you think that?

That sounds awesome!! I’ll definitely try and contribute to that tomorrow morning

Lmao I’m a female actually, and straight if that makes you feel any better. Hope you have a good rest of your day, Bud!

Person 1 lets person 2 in front of them, person 2 pays for person 1’s order. That’s all that was said What you GOT from it: 1) That person 1 gave a fuck about what person 2 looked like, 2) That person 2 had a superiority complex because they were pretty and thought they were more valuable as a person All in all you looked to make it as negative as you possibly could, which would’ve made me just think you’re a negative shithead, but the fact that you seem to have a grudge against pretty women screams “I’m an incel” to me

> Person 1 lets person 2 in front of them How does that even happen in a Drive Thru? How many people are behind person 1 waiting in line?? I've never seen a Drive Thru like this!

Thanks, my man

Lol you’ve probably not seen the drive through lines at Chick-fil-A these days that wrap around the building multiple times. Could’ve been a fuckload behind the first person. And idk man, I wouldn’t let someone in cuz I’m a greedy hungry bastard, but this person did and they got rewarded for it and they’re sharing about it

This is actually the second time the Reddit mob has downvoted me for commenting on Drive-Thru etiquette and then the OP describes some kind of bizarre traffic flow for a drive thru, and why it isn't really cutting. I don't care. I DON'T LIKE LINE CUTTERS.

I don’t like line cutters either, but it wasn’t cutting, the person who “cut” was LET IN Furthermore fucked up drive-through’s are common post-corona Further furthermore you didn’t get downvoted over the cutting bullshit You got downvoted for the fact that you immediately fixated on “Guy simps for girl who thinks she’s high and mighty, and I don’t like it” makes you seem like an I N C E L When the genders weren’t even included in the original post and on top of that, the one you thought was a dude was a straight girl

It's not cutting, it's a merge situation, from two valid lanes.

Ok... So no problem then. Once more - I DON'T LIKE LINE CUTTING. And also - Blonde ladies are not special.

That sounds like a crazy drive thru.

Once more, I feel a primal need to make you understand that you’re not being downvoted because you “don’t like linecutting” And also, I’m ashamed to share a hobby with your dumb ass Riling you is fun af tho

Have you ever been to Chick-fil-A in Christiansburg? It will blow your mind.

Main Street circa 1930’s

*Hails Sharkey’s bartender* “I would like 4 long islands and a room for the night”

Were cars not as wide back then or did the streets get slimmer through the years?

The lyric would be off to the right, that’s a good piece of history still there if one is interested. Haunted too apparently. Still a good movie experience to attend once or twice, usually independent small budget films are shown there.

[Similar photo taken at the same time](https://i.imgur.com/87QN9fB.jpg)

Seems like a good place for a traffic light.

Intriguing! Thanks for sharing!

Probably couldn't get the long islands before 1933 :)

interesting, i didn’t know it supposedly haunted! i haven’t seen a movie there yet but i’ll have to go once covid is over with.

Yep, I’m always a paranormal enthusiast, there’s not much in the area but the lyric is one. Apparently a worker in the early 1900s died etc. The duck pond is another history point on campus.

I worked the Lyric booth during Steppin Out one summer and was chatting with the other volunteer about the super generic ghost story origin with a construction worker dying when the building went up. Later that day a woman was flipping through the photo books and said she had a connection to the theater--her grandfather had fallen off a wall and died in 1929. We were so stunned that we did not ask her name. &#x200B; Just a few years ago, I babysat a group of students doing a paranormal investigation. They had flashlights and voice recorders for EVP. I put a group behind the screen and another in the letter room under the balcony. We later came back together and gathered in the balcony as I turned off all the lights. The leader asked everyone to sit on the floor so as to not pick up the squeaky seats during the EVP session. After about 20 minutes of asking, Is anyone there? What's your name? Why are you here? the leader said, Unless anyone has more questions, I think we're done. Suddenly you could hear the very distinct sound of someone getting our a a seat. The springs squeaked and the seat cushion flipped up. Everyone turned their flashlights on and everyone was still sitting on the floor.

can you expand on the duck pond history?

Yea, the best chance for EVPs is to use a recorder, ask the question and just leave the room. Let it run for a bit

Drapers meadow massacre, I don’t know where but I think there’s a plaque on site but yea that is the exact location of what used to be drapers meadow in the mid to late 1700s. At that time it was the edge of western settlement so Indians (Shawnee) attacked etc. literally the duck pond site, the duck pond today was actually created last century but naturally the site was a meadow, there’s a river that runs under the drill field. Even the local roads bear some history like Toms creek etc. Also the Shawnee attacked other Indians. It’s easy to think “we were encroaching in their land” but they were also nomadic. The Cherokee are probably the native land holders https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draper%27s_Meadow_massacre

>Drapers meadow massacre, I don’t know where but I think there’s a plaque on site but yea that is the exact location of what used to be drapers meadow in the mid to late 1700s. The plaque is just off the edge of Smithfield Road across from the Corps of Cadets obstacle course. It is attached to a large stone hidden in a clump of bushes and is easily missed.

Thanks, I remember seeing it when I was a student there. The duck pond is not natural, the local creeks are. Still a nice addition to the campus. Apparently feeding the ducks is bad though. Friends of mine used to do that.

Edging Club at Virginia Tech? My roommate (18M) and I (19M) just finished a sesh of our own and we were wondering if it exists? If not, why hasn’t one been started? Would garner a lot of interest. I did it competitively in high school (actually ended up winning the West Virginia state championship) and would love to continue in college

There used to be a club, but I heard that they finished.

First rule of edge club…

>actually ended up winning the West Virginia state championship Grats! Me and my sister took second place.

I wanna know what YOU mean by edging...

Welp, that's enough internet for today.

Wait, you can compete in that?!?!? I'm gonna get all the NIL money.

there is but you can't come

I aspire to be this self confident some day

> >and would love to continue in college You fucking mad man...

Currently edging at the moment. Been a long 2 hour session, trying to stay strong.

I am so confused

I'm horrified

when i went there we just played sports, went hiking, and grilled out in our free time.. now yall want to learn how to maintain lawn perimeters for fun. power to ya

I feel like I might not know what edging means.

Let me know if you make one I'll transfer.

Where is OP with the explanation?

Edging? Hmm…. 😂😂😂

Most normal conversation at Virginia tech

First rule of edge club is don’t talk about edge club.

Why couldn't I get this guy for a roommate instead of a homophobic gym rat?

You landscaping or manscaping?

RemindMe! 2 Days. I have to figure out what OP is looking for lmaoooo

You guys may want to explore a few of the places downtown.

Can’t wait until OP posts a comment about like, weed eaters.

You jerk off with your roomate?

Incredible things are happening at V Tech

What is edging? I looked it up on google, but then you were doing this competitively?? Is there a different definition of edging?

No idea what edging is.. too afraid to web search it

I love edging

Clearly this guy and his rm are in horticulture and like to edge the sidewalks and garden plots, you know, trim the grass back. Didn’t know they had competitions but maybe he can organize a team

Where's that guy who was looking for a sperm bank in a thread earlier this week?

Yo when tf is Deet's gonna be done with the big room that's my study spot 😤

Got my PhD a couple weeks ago, and I honestly still don’t know which door to take most of the time :P

Mcbryde exists in a parallel dimension where left is right and right is fuck you you're at Turner now.

Best use of this gif I have ever seen. I learned which way I was going by looking at the room numbers and which corners had vending machines.

McBryde is the math building, and they somehow designed it using non-Euclidean geometry.

I've walked an embarrassing amount of circles in McBryde

Freshman year I legitimately could not find my way out of Major Williams one time and lowkey began panicking thinking I’d entered a dimensional portal or some shit, there was absolutely nobody in the hallways or staircases either

Haha! Oh man I did that all 4 years and still would get the wrong door at least once a week! Ironic that its a compass rose! Maybe they need N S E W placarded again on the doors as well :P

i ALWAYS forget which way the numbers are and make huge circles because every professor closes the door and i can’t peak in and cheat

That building is a straight health hazard.

Me when I get my orienteering merit badge from finding my way around McBryde

Apparently deet's it's going to be done with the side room next semester, :(

Made me audibly laugh, Thank you !

No b/c McBryde is a menace 🤚🏽

it’s off-axis from the rest of campus because it’s on the compass rose and our tiny human brains can’t comprehend

Haha, good one

Hi, Deets staff here. Deets is currently undergoing a renovation. We will close over break and will not open again until September. The side room should be back sometime that fall semester. The renovations themselves are expected to conclude early Spring of 2023.

Oh, congratulations on the PhD!

Gotta start bringing a compass to class

Forgot to respond — thanks! :) definitely happy to be done with it!

They used to have the compass points on the floor in corners.In the area where the walls have the chamfers. They were pretty useful.

Your phone has one built in

They should put them there again.

Virginia Tech student and athlete arrested for second-degree murder in Blacksburg

Due to the nature of this post and excessive rumors, accusations and wishes, this thread has been locked. The current comments will not be deleted. As this is an on-going investigation, anyone with information about this case is encouraged to contact the Blacksburg Police Department at (540) 443-1400 or you can remain anonymous by calling the Blacksburg Police Tip Line at (540) 961-1819 or by emailing ciu@blacksburg.gov. Thank you.

So a brand new student to Blacksburg, barely starting football training, is somehow downtown, in a 40 year old's apartment........? Something about Jerry ain't clean. None of the news articles mentioned Isi being with teammates and as someone who has spent almost every summer on campus as an RA, it's RARE that you'll find a freshman athlete, by themselves, off campus unless it's some tinder hookup. I hope we're able to get the whole story. Edit: Just for clarity, Isi is a recent freshman meaning he is a 2021 graduate from high school. As a student athlete for football, he probably just got to Blacksburg after finals/graduation

I have friends who have matched with a person posing as “Angie” who lives at this same down town address. an obvious fake tinder profile but always asked their matches to come over and have sex. Anyone else run into this same profile?

This is some SVU law and order shit.

This thread is basically a trailer to whatever documentary is eventually going to be made about this whole situation..

FBI are now involved somehow. https://twitter.com/michaelniziolek/status/1400269038731866116

From a Blacksburg townie — I would like to offer some insight. Jerry Smith, an openly gay man (nothing wrong with that), has been fired from local establishments for sexually harassing young men. I am a credible source, as I was a coworker at said previous establishment. Before this event took place, it was widely rumored that Jerry had been slipping drugs into students drinks at the local bar he worked at called El Centro Taco Bar. Not to speak ill of the dead, but stating facts, Jerry had a reputation as a predator. Knowing this information about the victim, it truly makes me curious as to what exactly occurred on the night of June 1st. El Centro, where Jerry was employed, has a very bad reputation in terms of violating ABC laws, not following CDC guidelines during the COVID pandemic, and for the past 8 months has been a hot spot for roofies. Additionally, rapes and other assaults have been reported at this location as well. With all of this, El Centro has never lost their ABC license, or faced any consequences that I am aware of. It makes you wonder, how are they getting by with all of this misconduct? Rumor has it, Jerry had ties within the Blacksburg Police Department. With this knowledge (understandably, speculation), I wonder how this investigation will be handled and if what truly happened June 1st will come to light. Regardless of what Jerry Smith may have been into, murder is a cruel fate and I am not saying he “deserved” what happened to him. But I just wanted to share the information I have of the victim prior to the incident, as I feel like it is a crucial piece of this investigation.

Lawyer: “Your honor I present this Reddit thread.” Judge: “who’s got the Ask.fm?” Credit to my buddy for the joke

I knew Jerry when I was at Tech back in 2010. Surprised but not surprised given what I am reading in this thread.

Not positive if it is the same person, but the name of the person who was murdered is nephew of the mayor. And he has multiple business connections downtown including DP Dough, El Centro, and the Black Hen.

Based on the comments, the title of this thread should be “Midnight in the Hahn Horticulture Garden of Good and Evil.”

As a non-local, reading these comments are insane

It is curious that an 18 year old kid, athlete, from VA Beach who has been in Blacksburg; all of six months got tangled up with a local 40 year old man and a situation went so far left that murder was the only answer. 🤷🏻‍♀️🤔🤯

Anyone know the other players involved? Hearing there are another 2 involved. This has the potential to be a national trial.

This thread is crazy wow

There is no doubt this situation is all around tragic. That being said, a reminder that this is not a forum to wish harm or death on other individuals. Thank you to everyone following the rules and please report comments that don't.

i know his family, would not expect this from him. There’s definitely something else going on here.

way to throw away your life. condolences to the victim’s family. edit: yea based on the comments below, something weird is definitely going on here.

Wow I know Isi and I would never expect anything like this from him

I feel quite bad for both parties. Not saying Jerry/Angie had it coming, or deserved to die, but I do believe he is responsible for much of the drugging accusations around Centros (which should be shut down btw, there's a history of alcohol violations as long as they've been open). It is not hard at all to conceive of a crime of passion or illy thought out revenge for trying or successfully drugging the accuse.

Wow, this thread is crazy. I hope they figure out what really happened.

Coming from r/CFB, tragic situation, but reading through these comments are fascinating. Seems like the prelude to a Netflix Documentary with how close knit the Blacksburg community appears.

Oh this is so sad!

Reading about this old dude is weird. There's some wild similarities to a bar owner here in my college town.

Smokin on a bozo Im the dude who got the other two bagged luckily I escaped Jerry. Weird ass fuckin dude fr

No matter what the circumstances are Jerry did not deserve to die. I have known him for his entire life, and everything said here about him rings true. Jerry was not a bad person, but he did have some sort of (possibly undiagnosed) mental disorder. I think anyone who knows him would agree. Jerry's father was killed in a freak accident when he was very young, and his mother died suddenly of a heart attack a few years ago. I always thought that Jerry had had a rough life. Rest in peace, Jerry.

Saying El Rods serves alcohol to underage people is completely a reach not to mention an unnecessary accusation on the topic at hand. Not only that, but it’s also a bit of a reach to say that he played such a huge role at Centro as It’s not uncommon for people to overplay their part especially when trying to network themselves. A lot of people help build a business and you may never even hear their name! I know the owners personally and they would never just knowingly allow such behavior to go on. However can we also keep in mind that even though accusations can be placed on someone, from a business standpoint you cannot always act on them ignorantly especially with no physical proof with the obvious and main reason being is a major lawsuit! Let’s not forget what year we’re living in! people will throw out a lawsuit quick for things they do not have proof of STARTING with defamation of character! We cannot place blame and leave a new and STRUGGLING business (thanks to the pandemic) at fault for the behavior and actions of the one of MANY individuals that were associated with this business AND many other business’s in the Blacksburg area. Not to mention as previously stated the said accusations were also never proven! The pandemic has left many businesses in a bind and we should all have more compassion of the Repercussions that negative and also ignorant comments could have on others lives. I would also like to point out the complete ignorance regarding this individuals behavior leading to this tragedy, considering this hasn’t blown up until said individual was “murdered”. Can we normalize taking a stand on someone’s bad behavior BEFORE such drastic consequences that lead to everyone pointing fingers trying to find someone to blame?? Seems that all these “facts” of personal experiences with this individual are now being aired and if everyone would have come together to prove such misconduct maybe the circumstances could have been different. Now we have one dead and one who’s life is now ruined for something that could have potentially been avoided in the event that someone would have just spoken up regardless of said “victim’s” social standing with the mayor or whatever business in the Blacksburg community. My condolences to all involved.

There’s been rumors that Jerry was the guy putting roofies in peoples drink at El Centro. Something tells me there’s more to this story than a simply murder

The current rumor right now is that Jerry catfished Isi through tinder and he got beat to death

She added me on Facebook and would continuously message me asking for me to come over to her place on top of hokie mart for sex. And then like last week I received a friend request from who I thought was jerry because I already had his number in my phone but when I looked at the username it was actually this Angie woman

Yeah I bet there will be an Investigation Discovery TV show profiling this case in a few years, especially if even some of these rumors are true

I didn’t know any of the bburg town tea so I’ve been scrolling through these comments like :0

Have you shared all of this with the Blacksburg police?

whether he had ties to PD or not, the state ABC board generally deals with ABC violations, not local PD

Jerry was never employed at El Centro. He had nothing to do with the business other than working as a “project manager” for the expansion that centro has been planning. Please do not spread information that you aren’t 100% certain of.

"Your honor, we call u/L8breAker to the stand."

Honestly all the rumors flying around, esp. in this thread are ridiculous. Remember the break-in thing a few months ago that turned out to be not at all as bad as all the Twitter/Reddit threads were making it out to be? We'll know more when more information is released to the public. Making up wild theories and making comments about what we think happened does nothing but stir up drama.

Yep. I just noticed that as well. I have a mutual acquaintance with him and everything I know of him, he’s a shitty person by pretty much any standard. I’m *not* justifying anything done to him whatsoever, I’m just thinking it’s really weird the article said that a freshman athlete was acquaintances with a guy like him. Really curious what happened.

Probably not even 6 months unless he graduated hs early in the fall and came up early. He's probably only been in Blacksburg starting finals week or after. Edit: I'm sure it was some tinder catfishing gone wrong based on other's comments. Jerry posed as "Angie", Isi gets there and is like hell nah

Where are you seeing this?

I heard one (or both, not sure) was a freshman running back. Could be a true freshman or a redshirt freshman, also not sure. Apparently Christian and Black aren’t on campus yet, so that leaves several others. Just speculation so far and I’m just passing on rumors I’ve heard. Would love to know more if anyone else has some more info.

Why national? Nothing across state lines involved..

knowing the family does not mean that he isn’t fucked up if that’s what you’re implying. Edit: I thought they were referencing Jerry Smith. I apologize for my complete misunderstanding

So did you know Jerry?

So could this case get dropped if this is sexual assault?

Came to say this. But after reading the comments below, who knows what happened.

To the guy who randomly gave me a Metallica ticket today. Thank you. Me and my gf were sitting in front of Cassell and you gave us a free ticket. When you left I realized that it was a $1500 Snake-Pit VIP ticket. She is a lifelong Metallica fan and you have made her whole year, and by proxy, mine too. Thank you again.

Pay it forward. Hope you enjoyed the show. Looked awesome.

That was actually Sandman

I think Santa Claus added an extra night to his calendar

Damn. That’s cool.

Paying it forward doesn’t require actual payment. Go volunteer at a hospital or retirement home. Give something back even if it’s just your time. Doesn’t have to be monetary.

Sweet! it was an excellent show.

What a joy to be given that opportunity to treat your loved one! You were truly blessed!☺️

https://youtu.be/5xqiu0ekahw

That’s amazing ❤️ all of it.

I'm too broke to pay THAT forward, but I did bum a bunch of folks cigs tonight. I didn't go. The stranger only gave us one ticket and I gave it to my girl. I sat outside and watched and grinned like an idiot knowing how much fun she was having. To quote her "I could fucking count James' pores I was so close!"

TimSandman?!

Let's let the guy enjoy a nice moment

We should all do our best to do things like that all the time, not just as some sort of random karmic recompense.

Don’t recommend living your life and measuring your karma in such a transactional manner 👍

Thanks Debbie Downer.

Wait are you the guy?

So… you did pay it forward. Immediately, to your gf. :-) cheers, you’re the good kind. :-)

So, will you then?

Nah, your profile says you are 21 but this guy was definitely older than that

Johnny update

I’m just a rando alumni but I was wondering about that post that got taken down a couple weeks ago that was saying the university was playing music/voices everywhere and if the OP was serious and not shit posting they were clearly experiencing serious mental issues. Could it have been related? I’m guessing there is no way to know but I’ve been thinking about it ever since I saw it.

I hope they find him and can do a welfare check

As sad as it is, if he's a legal adult; not breaking any laws; and not a danger to himself or others, then there's really nothing anyone can do. The description seems like it's missing a key detail or two though. . .I'm assuming he used his credit or debit card, which alerted authorities, who then asked for the footage? Otherwise, why would a random Starbucks in Bumfuck, Missouri say "hey, isn't that the missing guy from Bumfuck Virginia we randomly happen to know about? Let's let the local PD know. . .but not give them the video footage for 5-7 days"

Why on earth is Starbucks waiting 5-7 days to release the footage to police? This is an active missing persons case, not a fender bender in their parking lot.

[Original thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/VirginiaTech/s/A7Ul4KVrrG) Previously reported by [ABC](https://abcnews.go.com/US/virginia-tech-student-missing-driving-home-exam/story?id=107372882), [NBC](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/rcna139479), and [USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/02/20/missing-v-t-student-johnny-roop-virginia/72668589007/).

His roommates said he wasn’t acting like his normal self before he left just fyi

Today learned poplar bluff has a Starbucks. PB is in the middle of nowhere. I mean it’s not a major route to go anywhere.

It sounds like Johnny may not fit within the norms of his family/friends and may be choosing to start new elsewhere.

While I’m not trying to downplay what could be a mental health episode, but sometimes people just want to get away and don’t feel it’s necessary to tell anyone. He’s an adult and maybe he met a girl online or wanted to go to a concert or something.

They keep saying he’s not okay but he seems to be pretty okay to me

That could also very easily not be Johnny. Johnny looks very standard, and there could be loads of people in Starbucks that look like him. If I was Johnny’s family, I’d be driving to Missouri because it would take less time than the video is taking to be released to cops.

Sources that this is affirmed ?

Be smart ..geez. So why post this and risk. Him seeing this and re locating? Maybe the family should just go there and talk to him instead of alerting that entire country

I'm thinking y'all should get a copy of Call of the Wild and read about Chris McCandless

Anyone know if he was failing classes this semester (or at least the class he had the test in at 5pm the day he was supposed to drive home to take that online test and disappeared? Because he's a senior about to graduate! Knowing how he was doing in school could provide a motive?? Have his roomates or friends been interviewed?

Would be interesting to see if anyone is able to relate that post to anything. If I remember correctly that was the only post in that account’s history as well.

I didn't see that, but, unfortunately, the timing for things like schizophrenia line up with the timeline for college - ages 18-25 is kinda the "golden" period for the illness to take hold of people, especially men.

He’s at a textbook age and place for schizophrenia. I’m really hoping they find him.

For all we know the person could’ve been having mental issues or was overhearing a sports games. Occasionally those can be heard across residential and on parts of the drillfield and if you’ve never heard them before it can be confusing. Some of them also happen during class hours like yesterday I think it was a lacrosse game that I heard from the drillfield. I doubt they are related though. Johnny lives off campus and is a senior. A lot of people who live off campus are only on it for classes and when they work if they do work on campus. I personally don’t live off campus, so feel free to correct me if I’m wrong. Edit: This reply is continuing a conversation from an alumni about a previous post made to Reddit about someone hearing music/voices on campus and whether it could possibly be related to Johnny. Long story short, I don’t think the two are related. The only time I mention Johnny is near the end of the post and that’s because before that point I was not talking about him.

I've been hearing weird music recently too tbh. I noticed around 12 pm and 5 pm today there was like this weird music playing over the campus and I assumed it was like a clock/bell kind of thing because of the time. I also noticed some weird music playing while walking on campus around Tuesday afternoon.

I think another thread said he was spotted withdrawing a large amount of money at the bank before leaving?

I work at Starbucks and as fucked up as it is, that's the policy. Pretty stupid in cases where you need the footage asap. We also can't grab the footage ourselves, the recordings are sent to an offsite source managed by corporate and can only be accessed by filing a police report

I could be wrong, but I don’t think this is currently a missing persons case per se, more of a concern—“please check in” situation. He is of age and, as far as I know, is currently not thought to be a victim of foul play—I’m not at all downplaying the concern for his safety and for his mental health, but he could have just run away from something for a bit. Not the healthiest way to handle things if so, but people operate with the coping skills they (think they) have in the moment. Speaking from experience and with empathy and hope for a good outcome.

There are pretty strict guidelines private companies follow when it comes to complying with legal requests for information, usually getting lawyers to cover their asses and assess really quick even if the item being requested isn’t a big deal.

Did John Roop ever come back to Abingdon or VT - has anyone heard from him since Missouri?

Is he back in Abingdon or at VT now? Is his Mom okay - that entire "passionate in Christianity" statement was a bit odd.

. . .except that his plan was to go home to Abingdon and be there by 5 to take an exam. I get packing up and skipping town for a weekend or longer. But the sudden change in plans with no communication from someone who normally communicates is cause for concern. &#x200B; >Point being, we don't know the whole story to justify jumping towards a missing person's case I'm curious what you think a "missing person's case" is or what justifies one. Someone who disappears without any communication, especially when they made specific plans otherwise, is a missing person. It doesn't mean there's anything nefarious or illegal, but that family and friends are concerned about their whereabouts. Once the person is spotted and seemingly OK, the case is closed. For example, there's a good book called *Under the Trestle* about Virginia's first no-body murder conviction. A Radford student was killed by a former VT football player a couple of decades ago. When she didn't show up for a planned date with an out-of-town friend, her family got worried and called police who investigated. Taking your "probably enjoying the freedom of being an adult these people have clearly starved him from" thought process, no one should have been worried; police shouldn't have investigated; and everyone just gone about their day. Am I getting that right? &#x200B; >with seemingly full cognizant faculties How do you get that from this post?

Sounds like you know him better than his family does- have they called you directly for more advice yet?

Upon seeing his photo this was my first thought too. Well, that and his mother’s description of him as being “passionate for Christianity”

Some people have mentioned that his behavior reminds them of their own family members who took a turn for the worst. At the bare minimum the police should do a wellness check on him and make sure that he doesn’t show signs of mental health issues. If they confirm he doesn’t and he states that he doesn’t want to be contacted by family or friends then yea I wish him a happy life, but he could actually need help.

No way it's something that simple or innocent at this point- If you read the original post and pleas from his family he was scheduled for an exam on the day he went missing and uncharacteristically went radio silent.

While all of that could be true, it seems less and less likely the more that's found out. For example, the just dropped press release from MCSO says he was alone at the restaurant and left as he was being identified by an employee. A normal reaction of someone taking a break from life is to say to someone, at some point in the last week "I'm OK, I just don't want to be bothered." But to leave and say nothing, especially if it's out of character for the person, is indicative of something else. For example (speculating here), paranoia is a symptom of schizophrenia. For someone who's paranoid, seeing their face all over the news, all over social media could exacerbate the problem. Acting out of character while cutting off all communication despite the widespread outreach? The concern is valid.

his sister is the one who posted that so pretty sure it’s accurate

read it Completely different scenario keep thinkin yall

It just stuck out to me after seeing the missing poster as well because schizophrenia usually affects males more and has an onset of early twenties. Regardless of whether it was or not related I really hope they can locate this student and confirm his safety.

A high school buddy of mine developed schizophrenia in grad school. Perfectly normal guy until he was around 22 years old. It’s hard to see it disrupt their life. If that’s what this guy has he will never be the same even with medication.

You’re probably right. Either way hope that OP is okay if it was even true. Hope everything comes to a good resolution for Johnny. I agree that if he has left on his own terms that he is an adult and can and should be able to do that without issue. I hope that is the case as it seems it would be the least bad reason/outcome for him.

I don't follow. This is about a guy who planned to drive a couple hours home late last week, told his family/friends about going home, but hasn't been heard from since. Not in his Christiansburg apartment, not in his home a couple hours away, not in Blacksburg, and not on campus. Apparently he was in Missouri but not communicating with anyone.

That would be the bells in the top of Burruss Hall. :)

Definitely strange behavior and, if its out of the ordinary, something for friends and family to be concerned about. But at the same time, I can sell all of my possessions, throw away my cell phone and laptop, close out my bank accounts, cash out my retirement account, drive to Louisiana, buy a cabin in a swamp, exchange all my money for gold bullion, bury it in mason jars in my swamp yard, and spend my days whit'lin and catching gators. As a side, that's one of the hard problems with the mental health system. As long as someone isn't a danger to themselves or others, there's nothing that can be done. So you have people who get TDO'd, get medicated, get released, get off their medication, and the cycle repeats. Worse if they commit a crime, in which case jails become revolving doors for the mentally ill. The book *Crazy* by Pete Earley gives a great overview and history of mental health in America.

Thanks for a clarification.

Not to be dismissive, but some of us here were around when students said they were going to take tests and jumped off of buildings. One student that was supposed to graduate with my class in 2018 attempted to kill his entire family, succeeded at murdering his brother and father with his father’s duty weapon after telling them he was returning to school the next day. There’s little that can realistically be done if this guy has taken off from his family due to some kind of extreme stress except hope that maybe they find evidence to label him a threat to himself or others. Otherwise he is an adult on the go.

Exactly and if this is this the case I hope he finds the peace and happiness he deserves being his true self.

I think her brother has broke mama's heart and is headed out west where the wild things are. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHwaVMPLhHs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHwaVMPLhHs)

Yes I am not saying he should not be checked on but as someone who lived with Ultra religious family and went no contact with my own mother I have a feeling there is more to this than him just disappearing.

The police are useless when it comes to mental health issues. They will not help anyone in crisis and they are not trained to recognize psychosis.

Hmm… how has this not been cancelled? Seems ripe for heckling.

Boeing CEO is a VT alum so probably something related to that

I can't wait to hear the Q&A.

This is a great opportunity to really get into the nuts and bolts of the issue. Attending will open many doors for your future.

Its college of Business not COE

VT Tech Fellows Faculty advisor here: this is a Boeing event. They scheduled it last semester. Pamplin/VT Tech Fellows is helping to support the logistics for the event, but this isn’t a Pamplin-organized or controlled event. Boeing has had their Chief Strategy Officer, Chief Technology Officer, Chief Sustainability Officer (a few weeks ago), and now the Chief Safety Officer at these events over the past few semesters. We support these events to help connect students from all over campus with visiting executives. Last spring, Marc Allen (Chief Strategy Officer) spoke openly about the 737-MAX crisis. He was very candid and honest during the Q&A session in response to audience questions. So if anyone wants to engage in a dialogue with Mike Delaney, then come to the event, hear what he has to say, and engage him during the Q&A. He will be speaking in other classes and at different events during his time here on campus, including with groups in COE, as well, so there are multiple opportunities to hear what he has to say on these safety questions.

"A culture of quality engineering can open new doors."

We learn from our mistakes which is why we will continue making mistakes

I'd echo u/Herzha-Karusa's sentiment. There's no real reason to cancel such a talk. Possible claims: * "But Boeing has a PR crisis!" --- That's Boeing's problem, not VT's. Also, shutting down communication from an organization with a PR crisis seems... counterproductive. * "People from outside VT might show up and be disruptive!" --- So? Attendance could be restricted to VT-related persons, but that's not cause to stop the event per se. Tighten security and escort the hecklers out. * "People from within VT might heckle!" --- Hecklers have been present at presentations at colleges for decades. Same as above; tighten security and escort them out. * "It reflects poorly on VT" --- How? You might question Boeing's integrity as a company, but that isn't necessarily a reflection of this individual's character. Possibly a reflection on his competence/efficacy, but in an organization of that size, even excellent high-level leaders' efforts can be diminished by lower-level employees. * "There's nothing to learn because Boeing is bad" --- that's overly reductive. Do we stop talks from NASA because of the Space Shuttle disasters? Or from tech companies that experience data breaches? When things go wrong, there's lots to learn.

You guys aren't getting it. VT shouldn't care much about canceling it. Boeing absolutely should. Kind of like the chief food safety officer at Chipotle giving a lecture about quality control during an E Coli outbreak. It's embarrassing and tone deaf.

Somebody please ask about the whistleblower that mysteriously wound up dead recently.

Why *would* it be cancelled on account of a few randoms deciding to heckle? They’d just kick them out and continue on

Really glad Boeing is going to teach students how an American company should be ran. Profits over people, safely, and lives.

College and the real world are two different things

I think it would really depend on how Mike wants to address the current issues Boeing has had. He certainly has more than enough material to discuss why the details of engineering matter. If he’s honest about their failings and can do a compelling job showing how important the details are then everyone should be able to benefit. But if he gets up there and acts infallible then of course it’s the definition of irony and would show how the executives are out of touch.

Oh if you think thats bad, Boeing is building a few million dollar "center for aviation safety" on Embry-Riddles campus in Daytona

Seems like he should have bigger priorities???

Ask Boeing. They're the ones having a PR crisis. This guy is about to get torn apart by college students and it's gonna be glorious.

Someone please record this lmao

I would go and ask something like "Shouldn't this talk be given to an engineering group, given recent events with safety at Boeing?'

Why cutting loose ends matter

Controversial.

Boeing look like a paper plane out here

O great we can smoke that good and build planes can't wait heard Boeing giving out free pree rolls

carefully screened attendees i would imagine

The whistleblower got cancelled.

Why should it be canceled?

Same reason we had John legend come and talk about the importance of k-12 teachers yet couldn't answer as single question about how to improve education... This was in 2011-2012

But still, this is not a smart crisis management move. The CEO isn’t speaking, but the safety officer. There will probably be national and int’l media that show up.

Yeah, David Calhoun funds the Honors College and probably more as well. He has the whole “Calhoun Discovery Program” named after him. IMO it makes an event like this more deserving of criticism

"Where were you on the night of the 10th?"

Nuts torqued to spec: Must-have or mearly a suggestion?

Wouldn't be surprised if they don't hold one in light of the current circumstances.

“First, I’d like to congratulate you on your recent performance. Second, will you fulfill your obligation to the shareholders to preemptively assassinate potential whistleblowers before they go to the press?”

Mans about to be slaughtered

Doesn’t seem like a great time for Boeing’s Chief Aerospace Safety Officer to be lecturing anyone about “details of engineering”, whether Pamplin or COE Also, the choice seems fitting based on Boeing’s motives

The PR required to not look awful in these circumstances in Executive Leadership 101...so tragically fits I guess?

One other quick note re: the engineering v. business framing in some of the comments here. In Marc Allen’s talk, he addressed some of these issues directly when discussing the 737-MAX crisis, and how the company had to change to adopt a more holistic approach to engaging and serving their stakeholders. I think every disciplinary/knowledge area has its own ‘conceit’ that if they could only be left alone to ‘run things,’ everything would be perfect. Real organizations, even those run by engineers, require complex and difficult trade-offs that require organizations to engage a complex array of stakeholder needs and interests.. So while world-class engineering and design are essential — and no one in our group here in Pamplin would suggest otherwise — a viable organization still has to be built. These public conversations at VT with Boeing and other corp execs provide unique opportunities to hear how these leaders think about these issues and manage these trade-offs. They may be wrong. The approaches they use may be flawed. But in my experience in working with them through these events, in our courses, and other programs, the entire Boeing team is incredibly generous with their time and in sharing their thoughts while here. Whether you agree or not with their views is immaterial. Come hear what they have to say, engage in dialogue with them if there is something you don’t understand or agree with, debate with your friends, and figure out how to build your own leadership model that you think will work best. That’s the whole point of higher education.

Seriously underrated comment

This is a fair perspective, but at the same time a mistake due to negligence is not equivalent to an unforced error or unforeseen consequence of a standard practice. The present criticism of Boeing is due to the former.

I am surprised he doesn’t have more pressing priorities. Surprised he didn’t cancel.

Yeah this is what I was saying in the title. How can Boeing think this would be a good idea? Just hilarious that VT is unironically advertising it, as if doing so doesn’t reflect poorly on both parties.

Of course they wouldn’t cancel it for that reason. I’m saying that the university *shouldn’t* host an event when Boeing is in a PR crisis. It’ll just bring the PR crisis here.

You know that the DOJ has opened a criminal investigation into the safety practices of Boeing? Why would the Chief Safety Officer come up there and “be honest”?

Usually these types of things are caused by the business side pushing shortcuts on the engineering teams versus actual issues with engineering. It was crazy how every issue we studied in Engineering Ethics class was caused by business/management decisions while you had engineers complaining, but they don't push the same thing on the business majors.

Context is current events, evidenced through the entire internet and all media outlets

Upgrades people

More like when they see a sidewalk that hasn't been blocked yet

I appreciate the Robots reference

And yet they aren’t building a math empo on campus

I heard through the VT grapevine that Tech will potentially turn as many parking lots into buildings. Can anyone confirm this?

Reminds me of Richmond when they see a road not under construction.

Agreed, on campus, they basically just play in the dirt for several months, and then make a sidewalk?

Bought the parking pass only to find out the only lot I could park in was on the other side of campus.

I've heard that the master plan is to get rid of on-campus parking for commuter students and instead have commuters park in a giant parking lot center that's supposed to be built near the Corporate Research Center and to have busses shuttle those students to the Litton-Reeves bus stop to join with the current BBGTransit route. Sounds too stupid to be true, but I heard it from a faculty member of the parking services board committee, and it could just be a Burruss pipedream.

That doesn’t sound that bad actually, if it is executed properly tho

That's kinda how the rest of the world works and they seem to be doing fine

Virginia Tech dismisses football coach Justin Fuente, names J.C. Price interim

🦀🦀🦀🦀 FUENTE IS GONE 🦀🦀🦀🦀

Let's go. Glad Whit didn't let it get to the point that he'd have to decide whether or not to do it after possibly beating UVA to get bowl eligible, was starting to think that would get him another year. Interesting that they went with Price over Hamilton

SMOKING THAT FUENTE PACK 🚬

Does this mean I have to change my username??

Neither Cornelsen or Hamilton are the interim head coach, so likely some changes there as well in the future!

F I R E D U E N T E

Another classy move by Whit - He let JF go out on a high note! EDIT: ...and it puts JF on the market early to find another gig. GO HOKIES!

He had to go. Program slid hard after a strong start. Was hoping he could keep his job this year but they slid after a strong performance against unc. Hoping for Napier but we'll see.

Should have happened a couple seasons ago, but better late than never.

https://i.imgur.com/brackk3.gifv

Sad to see. Not the firing. But the program. Been my fav college team since I was a kid. Hokie bird baby! I hope that we can turn this around big time

Man the timing is weird as hell. It should have been end of last year, or earlier in the season so they could get a head start on the search. If not after Syracuse they should have waited until December 15th save a few million and let Fuente finish the season (not like 30 days makes a difference now). But why middle of week 13, that's the weirdest possible time to fire a coach.

Fuck yissss

Nature is healing!

This was planned thru the weekend. They didn't announce his name as HC before the game like usual. Billy Napier is the target from what I hear.

4 weeks late but finally

Praise Jesus. I can’t believe it happened before thanksgiving.

Who would y’all want too see hired as replacement?

I kind of like University of South Carolina’s coach.

Fired Fuente.

Lol us too- From UW

A couple years late, but better late than never. Who do we have a decent shot at grabbing though? Are there any good coaches who would want to come to VT?

Fellow Hokies, in the meantime let’s go for the basketball 🏀 team they’re really good this year (or supposed to be)l coach Young got this.

Thank God! Now maybe we can stop hearing about this man, I swear this is just r/VTSports some days, I get that sports is important to people but it's getting to be a bit much when every 3rd post is about ________ person in the football or basketball team isn't doing what you think they should.

That’s gonna be a mistake

10 mil in debt. Good luck hiring someone good with that money gone. The person. Who gave him that contract extension should be fired too lol.

I wonder how many professors they will let go to pay his severance package?

BYE BYE FUENTE

I’ll take it

Well no more “fire Fuente” posts lol…. This came earlier than expected I figured mid December

I would have fired that clown immediately after the WV game. Asshat play calling.

I was about to post the verbatim

This comment has been overwritten in response to Reddit's limitations on third party API access.

been plenty of disappointing losses for you to think about in the meantime.

Was discussed after BC loss (per Whit at today's press conference), was allowed to coach through Senior Day.

Is it tho? Isn’t Hamilton already fairly young to be a DC?

😶‍🌫️😶‍🌫️😶‍🌫️😮‍💨💨💨💨

No, you’ll just have to use it to warn the fans of whatever school he ends up at.

May you have peace.

No, but will probably have to become active in the TCU subreddit going forward.

Corny will likely end up wherever JF lands

That is what is even bigger than Fuente being out. This shows Corny is gone as well and maybe even Hamilton but certainly Corn

If you watched the presser this morning, you would have heard Whit say that he will be letting the new HC decide who he keeps and who goes. So no, the decision for who is the interim head has no bearing on who stays or goes.

I have been pretty happy with Jham tbh.

both are gone no matter who is hired... Corn is bad and Hamilton is riding on the same design as Foster did the last few years and that is bad prevent defense and that is what cost us games.

Yep the marriage was over. No reason to make it ugly.

Why were you hoping he would keep his job? Tech fan? Gotta be a masochist.

The buyout eventually reached a tolerable point. In the past it was holding them back

Comes out with a walker and coaches the team to an acc title……..

WhAt aBoUt tHe SoCkS

Giving day is the most audacity crammed into one stunt I have ever seen

My donation is my tuition :)

I got a call, august 2013. I graduated may 2013. It was my first month of grad school. They asked for $50. I said, I just started grad school, my loans are deferred. "So how about $20?" I was able to control myself, and asked them to call back in a decade, when hopefully Ill have a job. I havnt been called yet, so I geuss Remindme! 19 months. We'll see if they call.

I remember my parents dropping me off for move in my Freshman year. I’m the oldest child so their first kid to leave the nest. Not two hours later my mom got a call on her cell from Tech asking her to donate to the school. She replied, “I just gave you my first born, never call me again”, and hung up. They never called again.

The Bursar's office reminds me every semester to Give. And give and give some more. So there you go

I don’t have any money to give in the first place

I'm in the process of buying my bachelors, when they give me an MBA I'll give them more money.

The audacity to ask for more money.

with the way they nickle and dime students its beyond offensive to ask for more donations lol

cut the cost of tuition, then we'll talk.

I doubt I'll ever donate honestly

I had to tell them I may give once my student loans are paid off.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiqKK4ysI7g](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiqKK4ysI7g)

I got a call recently and it was difficult for them to grasp the fact that I've been unemployed since April due to my industry, theme parks and tourism, being completely shuttered and continuing to be crippled.

Maybe don't nickel and dime students while they attend and maybe I would feel generous to donate. Plus, Tech literally gets millions of $ in tax exemptions for being a public university. No thanks!

Parking Services reminded me to give enough in 5 years...

I pray I’m never in a position where I’m spamming college students for donations

A lot of the money from donations goes to scholarships; maybe you should check that out. Much more of it goes to things like the dining halls and other creature comforts.

They can just take it out of my student loans if they want. But in all honesty, I donate $50 every couple years in case my future kid wants to attend.

This had better be the John Mulaney bit. Edit: It is! I'm glad I'm not the only one who thought about it!

This is the way. It isn't important how much you give, it's important that you give. Think of how many scholarships could be handed out if every single member of the class of 2022 gave a one-time gift of $20.22.

We made it to the front of r/facepalm lol

Funny how every game on this weekend has a stadium packed with unmasked fans but somehow people have to give Virginia Tech a hard time. Ridiculous!

Worth it though 😎

Is having 65k people standing around outside for 3 hours that much more risky than housing however many students live on campus together in the same buildings for an entire year?

reddit moment

They hate us cause they ain’t us

On the one hand, I loved seeing Lane packed and rocking again. On the other hand, I know some townies who are concerned about community spread after having 66k people drop by. As others have said, if it was only the student section then sure, having the student body 90+% vaxxed would help limit the spread. I think the potential issue is the tens of thousands of people who came into town, milled about for several hours, and had zero precautions to follow once packed into Lane. Personally I’d have done what some music venues have done where you either have to provide proof of vax or a negative test result. Yes, I understand transmission risk is lower outdoors. And different people take different risks. And that if someone went unvaxxed they may have to deal with the consequences of that. What concerns me is how we’re seeing more and more kids getting this, and hospital ERs being so full people can’t get timely treatment for non-Covid problems. Its a tough situation all around. I’m out of patience for people who willingly remain unvaxxed due to the harm it is causing our communities, because their choices can affect us all negatively. Sorry for the novel. Its been on my mind today after hearing from some friends in town.

Lotta people on Reddit are upset that others aren’t miserable like them

Majority young and healthy student body, everyone vaccinated, outside. If we can’t do this… what can we do? If this doesn’t work should we accept we are never going back to normal? Genuine question. Lock down forever?

Reddit is fucking stupid

> "I genuinely wonder how many people will die as a direct result of their decision to go to this game" My guess is zero

If you need more salt, please see these comments: https://twitter.com/accnetwork/status/1433916233599143944

if you’re scared of covid and have gotten the vaccine, stay inside. and if u haven’t gotten the vaccine at all, don’t open your mouth no one cares about your opinion.

R/covidiots too. Let’s go…

They're just mad because we have a metal intro.

Why is Reddit so soft😭

I simply cannot fathom that anyone still cares

Lmao everyone on Reddit is a nerdy loser

Wait Reddit wants everyone's fun and freedom ruined? New development!

The so-called "covid police" have seemingly become anti-science about the vaccine, transmission, herd immunity, etc. It's really ironic. But like they say, once you go too far to one side, you get closer to the other... Crazy people on all sides

Socials been full of crybabies about this game today lol

Go hokies! (I was wearing a mask)

Softer than charmin. That game was legit so fuck the haters

I'm just so tired. I really don't want to go back to online only. All the people in this thread saying that people are being "babies" about complaining about this sort of behavior are going to be eating their words if this causes an outbreak that forces campus to shut down.

Well its kinda true when most didn't listen to the mask requirements under the stadium, inside bathrooms and such. Could have at least followed that part of it.

Vaccines weren’t required for entry... honestly I was pretty nervous about this event too.

The covid police will never be satisfied. You meet one requirement - close till the vaccine? Ok, they come up with a new requirement you have to meet until you can live your normal life again - at least __% of people need to get it. Ok, you do that. Ok, they come up with a new requirement - we need to wait until under 12s get it. Its time to realize they'll never be satisfied and will keep coming up with new reasons we need to waste more of our youth inside regardless of what we do now. Go have fun, live your lives, and ignore the naysayers.

A great post to Facepalm would be a link to that post.

Oh sorry we have the most hype intro of all time. Also 90% of people have vaccines so we good

Idk why everyone on Twitter is complaining, their crying won’t stop us from packing in 60k strong

Jesus christ, i would collapse

Because we bring the most attention!!!! Enter Sandman is unbeatable.

Because tech has a vaccine mandate

Tbh Student are required to be vaccinated. Not so much the fact for other people in the stadium. If you're a student and in the student section then you were probably fine.. Others.. RIP you made a decision

Plot twist: the person who posted this is from UNC and they’re mad they lost

This is a good take. I am not concerned about students and I am not concerned about outdoor transmission like in a football stadium. I would be more concerned about the people who maybe came from an area with lower vaccination rates, went to bars, partied with people indoors, went out to dinner beforehand etc.

I, for one, 100% agree with your rant. Pretty disappointed in the lack of nuance in these comments, but I guess the post is still pretty new.

I completely agree, I was really worried because I was working in the stadium yesterday, so I wore my mask for the entire time even when I was outdoors (I was indoors for the most part). A lot of the adults I saw attending were not masked most of the time, if at all, and I don’t know if they’re vaxxed or not, so better be safe than sorry.

I am also concerned from a townie perspective. I'm an alum who no longer lives in Blacksburg, but I have a lot of townie friends. In fact, I visited some of them over Labor Day since all of them were now fully vaccinated. Somehow I missed the memo that there was a *major* game that weekend. I was appalled at how no one was following any sort of caution. No masks indoors or out. No social distancing. People getting right up next to their friends face to talk to them because it was so loud even outside. I was honestly mad at all the non-students who traveled for the game. They are putting every student and townie who works in Blacksburg at risk. The townies don't necessarily have the same access to medical care and testing that the students have. The students are in close quarters and breakthrough infections will spread fast. it pisses me off. Everyone is acting like COVID is over. It's not.

Hoes do be mad

Very true feels like some people want to just permanently lock down the world

It's not just Reddit and it's not recent, but yeah.

I was downvoted a lot for telling folks they were wrong when they said everyone had to show vaccine proof to go in.

This is a big thing. If a healthy population of young people who are 96% fully vaccinated and wear masks inside buildings can't beat covid everyone is fucked

This is also what I’m confused about. How are people not getting this? We are all vaccinated, and outdoors. The freshmen are all packed like sardines in the dorms which are like Petri dishes. How do people think this is any worse?

Were vaccines required for entry?

You realize its 99% bots, middle school white kids and sexual predators, right?

Fall 2020--remote lectures and optional assignments and office hours, oh my First off, I want to say that I'm not going to judge anyone's decisions (yours, the university's, etc.) regarding the upcoming fall. This is a shit sandwich of a situation on all fronts, and I'm nowhere near qualified to evaluate one way or the other. That said, I want to give everyone some advice based on what I saw last semester and how I see things shaping up for the fall, **especially those of you who will be first-semester students this fall.** Normally, I advise my students about parts of the course, the university system, etc. that I perceive as "traps." Now, to be clear, by "trap," I mean "thing that lots of people ignore because it's not mandatory," not "something that’s deliberately set up to screw you over." Pitfall might be a better word, [but I've always said trap, so I'm sticking with it](https://media1.giphy.com/media/3ornka9rAaKRA2Rkac/giphy.gif). For example: * Optional homework--it's a trap. It's not optional, do it unless you're already coasting. If I give this, I'm probably going to copy test questions from it. * Optional review session--it's a trap. Sure, it's technically optional, but if we're giving it, we think it’s necessary for some reason. Show up, unless you're already coasting. * That topic we gave one homework on and never touched again but said, "be sure you know how this works"--it's a trap. If we told you that you need to know how it works, there's a reason. I'm not giving you long creepy stares after I say that for my health. There are also many things that I'm not going into that I *literally* beg students to do because it'll make their lives easier. Usually, it's only the students that could get away *without* doing these things that take advantage of them. With all of that in mind: &#x200B; &#x200B; &#x200B; **This whole semester is a trap.** &#x200B; &#x200B; &#x200B; All of the departments and faculty are working hard to try and make something reasonable. Still, I **cannot** see an end structure that doesn't result in a truly absurd number of things that aren't required, and that you can blow off with no ill effects in the short term. This will be especially true for video lectures. &#x200B; **Do not let these things slide.** &#x200B; If something has been provided, recommended, or suggested, **especially** now, it's for a reason. If you're comfortable with something after reviewing it, fantastic! Don't kill yourself obsessing over it. But if you're not super familiar, or even slightly uncomfortable, go through it. Many of the instructors have lost MOST of the tools we traditionally use to make sure everything is going smoothly, so some of that burden will unavoidably fall on **you.** &#x200B; The **number one thing** that I see students not do, especially in their first year, is attending office hours. &#x200B; **Office hours are one of the few things that there might be more of during this semester.** &#x200B; Compared to regular (in-person) office hours, they're going to suck (in my opinion). I'm personally working on ways to ameliorate the effect of remote office hours, but there's a limit to what I can do. That said, while I can't speak for all instructors/TAs/etc., most of us are more than happy to help out anyone that comes to office hours. This is also going to be one of the few ways that we can clarify things from video lectures, and possibly one of the only times you'll have real-time face-to-face communication. **Take advantage of that.** Keep in mind: * Office hours are held specifically so that we can help you with things that **you** want help with. * There's not a lower bound for something being "worth" being brought to office hours. If you have a question, we're here to answer. * You are not interrupting someone if you come to office hours; that is time set aside for **you.** Many instructors end up doing work during their office hours **because** **people rarely show up**. * Most of us are entirely comfortable with someone dropping by office hours (especially remotely) just to work, **in case something comes up**! I've had several students sit in my twitch channel during office hours, only to let me know that everything went smoothly before leaving. **This is fine!** &#x200B; Most students come to office hours the day (or night) a homework is due. Often, this is too late, especially when everyone is doing the same thing. Usually, I only have time for 1-2 hours of office hours on a given day. Having 10+ people in them with entirely unrelated questions means that I have, at most, 6-12 minutes to help each person with a problem they may have been tangling with for hours. Start assignments as early as you can, and **don't put off coming to office hours.** &#x200B; **If you've hit a wall, ask someone.** Send an e-mail to an instructor/TA, drop by office hours, etc. We won't judge you based on the complexity of the issue. The **only** things most teaching staff will be annoyed by are: 1. [Not trying anything before asking.](https://i.imgur.com/zJqx7cY.gif) 2. Asking too late for us to do anything to help (two hours before the homework is due, for example). 3. NOT asking for help after a significant life disruption ("I didn't turn in my homework because I broke my collarbone and was in the hospital for two days, but I know the class policy is 'no late assignments'"<--I have actually have had several students do something like this. **Do not do this.**) There are going to be **ample** opportunities for things to slip under the radar this semester. There may be FAR less that's actually "required" than normal. You may only have physical lectures in an extremely limited capacity. In addition to actually watching all of the lectures, doing the readings, etc., **office hours and "recommended" assignments/reading/etc. are some of the few ways to offset what's coming**. &#x200B; &#x200B; TL;DR: * Semester gonna be rough. * We're trying our best, but it's probably going to be difficult. * Optional work/assignments/lectures aren't. * Do them if at all possible. * It's gonna be super easy to let things slip. * Don't. That way madness lies. * **Come to office hours.** * **We want to help!** &#x200B; &#x200B; \[EDIT: Thanks for all the awards everyone! Hopefully this will help some folks for this fall and further one. I missed two significant points--the first was the point that [/u/wickedsweetcake](https://www.reddit.com/u/wickedsweetcake/) made in the comments about communicating with your instructors, which they detailed perfectly. The other is what [/u/trumpetkid](https://www.reddit.com/u/trumpetkid/) noted about the need to relax; I didn't include that in my main post because it wasn't something I was thinking about at the time, but with that in mind... **Take breaks to de-stress. You will not make it through if you don't.** This may mean reading "War and Peace". It may be painting. It may be watching absurd gameshows. Whatever relaxes you, make sure you take time to do it. Otherwise not only will you eventually turn into a human stress ball, but **you'll work less efficiently**. That means you'll have less time to take breaks, which means you'll work more and relax less, and so forth. I can tell you from first-hand experience, that's no way to live. As someone who's terrible at this, I've resorted to scheduling breaks on my calendar. During those breaks *I do not work*. That's what it takes for me to not let my work creep into my relaxation time, but whatever works for you, do it. Thanks again to everyone who commented--if anyone has any specific questions or comments, you can also feel free to DM me and I'll do my best to answer!\]

This is probably one of the most concise "guides to surviving college" that I've seen in a while, virus or not. Nicely done,

Every time you wrote that something was a trap, I read it in Admiral Ackbar’s voice in my mind.

This is all fantastic advice that I hope you take to heart. The only other thing that I can think to add is that if something isn't going smoothly in the course, **tell us so we can (try to) fix it!** Even if we're actively looking for feedback, we might not be asking the right questions. The easy example is from the online switch last semester. I was originally hosting videos on Canvas and linking them to a page for each lesson. Then I found out two weeks after break that a subset of students were only getting the audio content of the lectures but no video because of a weird codec issue. Just switching things around to hosting videos on YouTube was a trivial fix. Imagine how much of a change it is for us to go from being able to see your faces and register the confused/bored/attentive expressions to primarily having one-way communication in the lectures. We're not going to be able to adapt mid-lecture, let alone across several lectures without some feedback. If the lectures seem to be going too slow/too fast, **tell us** so that we can poll the full class and adjust as needed. If some explanation in a lecture was confusing, **tell us** so that we can revisit it in the next video, or dedicate a short "optional" lesson to digging into more detail. If you're reading an assignment spec and just have no idea where to start, **tell us** so that we can provide a hint to the full class. If a sizable percentage of you are also taking class X in another department and you have a big assignment/project/test due on the same day that something equally weighty is due in my class, **tell me** so that I can flex the calendar (probably not all instructors are willing to do this, but many are). tl;dr: We need to know when and where problems are happening, even if we're being proactive in trying to find them.

This semester is going to be rough for me. Thanks for the advice.

People need to take this to heart especially next semester. I wouldn't be surprised if grades tank next semester.

I second the recommendation for office hours. Most TAs I know and personally speaking, tried to be extra accommodating with office hours and no one showed up. With Zoom and everything there are a lot more interactive ways we can help you out with stuff and since everyone is in the same boat, we were trying to be extra helpful with any questions you have. Make use of that because one on one interactions during these times are going to be invaluable to you too. Mentally, it will help you be more comfortable with the course as well! All the best everyone :)

Oh yes, the great "optional" review session. Most classes that offer those usually use it as a "wall" to separate students from getting an A. This was true for my major and unrelated minor. It's always a great idea to go.

This is going to be a hard semester for students, but also us faculty and staff. We're all in this together, and hopefully we all get through it together!

Disclaimer: This guide does not apply to business majors (except BIT). Disclaimer to this disclaimer: Just kidding take it seriously. But also have fun. Don’t turn into a stress ball.

Remindme! 56 days

All great advice. Now I just need to bring myself to actually follow and listen to it

Does coasting here == "going to graduate this Fall?"

This was awesome! Thank you for the advice. Points we all “already know” but definitely need to be reminded of because we tend not to do them!

Thank you for this advice! I wish I had read this back before my first semester. Actually going to office hours for help would have made a big difference.

A Dad of a newly minted incoming Hokie Daughter truly thanks you for these timely comments Prof ! Definitely sharing with her. Glad to read something that gives me comfort knowing she will be well taken care of by dedicated educators trying their damn best to make this all work. Sage advice on personal responsibility and accountability.

Mod sticky please.

I don't even go to Virginia tech, but saw this cross posted on another subreddit. Great advice, super helpful. Thankful for the insight from a prof

This is great advice and also why the transition last semester wasn’t too bad for me. I hope most follow suit.

!remindme 55 days

I shared this on my facebook and it's getting shared around by other people - this is incredibly good information especially for incoming freshmen

Thanks! A lot of it is from personal painful experience :p

Not a problem, I hope it helps!

Excellent--my work here is done!

\^\^\^\^\^So much this. Thank you for saying this--I set up a bunch of tools last semester for managing office hours/providing support, and I have almost no idea if they were helpful. I can't count the number of times I've gotten feedback on SPOT that I wish I'd had from day 1. It's also absurdly hard to gauge anything with no visual feedback. I'm still trying to figure out a way to offset that without asking people to turn on their cameras.

Unfortunately I think it's going to be rough for everyone. I know I've struggled just staying focused on my research, and I don't have near the number of commitments most people on this sub do. I hope this helps at least a little!

You're saying that and it hasn't even started yet.

... or heavily inflated because people who normally wouldn’t still manage to scheme their way through :/

Yup, there were points last semester where I ended up holding my office hours for random twitch viewers. Not a bad experience, but not what I expected.

I'm not sure I'd call it a wall (at least not in any courses I've been involved in), but it's definitely some kind of dividing line. It's really difficult to distinguish between those students who attend but don't need it to do well and students who attend and do well because of it. I made it a rule of thumb to always go unless I had a stunningly good reason not to.

Reminds me of Intro to Cinema

Absolutely!

100000% Actually, I need to edit the post to include this. Thanks!

I've resorted to putting sticky notes around my apartment telling me what to do, Memento-style.

You're welcome! :D

I’m also graduating this fall and I’m truly devastated this is going to be my last undergrad experience here. Applying for grad school so i gotta keep the grades up it just is really ass that I’ve lost most of my last year between the bullshit that was spring semester and the joke that is this fall

I felt that was meant behind it. I just can’t imagine coasting due to graduating that same semester but it happens.

No problem! I actually think it varies a lot from person to person. Based on some informal polls I've seen, a surprising number of people think office hours are **only** for specific things (like current homework sets). That said, I agree--I've had to remind myself of a LOT of things since all this started (on a regular basis) that I definitely already knew.

Unfortunately, from what I've heard/seen, it's going to vary department by department, and class-by-class. With larger classes, it's hard to say, but I suspect we'll see reduced in-person attendance in order to maintain social distancing within classrooms, and all other material provided online, or a complete switch to online. With respect to their plan for handling outbreaks, all of what I know comes from [VT's COVID page](https://vt.edu/ready/for-students.html#residence), but my guess is they'll have rooms set aside for quarantine (ctrl+f isolation on that page) in the event of infection, in addition to the other precautions. As far as how that works academically, my guess is those policies are being worked on we speak. &#x200B; All of that said, every single thing that's been planned could change entirely--we're essentially two months out from the start of the semester, and a lot could happen between now and then.

You're welcome! The same is true for me; I didn't figure out office hours until probably the second semester of my junior year. I'm always surprised how little this is emphasized at the beginning of undergrad.

I'm glad I could help! This is a rough time to be starting undergrad, to say the least; hopefully my advice can help make things a little bit easier. Full disclosure, though I've taught for several years (as an instructor), I'm still a grad student/teaching assistant (though hopefully not for much longer!). If she/you have any questions, please don't hesitate to send me a message (either on reddit or elsewhere) and I'll do my best to help out!

I'm glad it's so useful! Hopefully, people can learn from some of my (many) mistakes! Full disclosure, though I've taught for several years (as an instructor), I'm still a grad student/teaching assistant (though hopefully not for much longer!).

I'm so glad it's useful! Hopefully it'll smooth the path for some folks this fall!

Honestly, I expect both. I'm extremely concerned about people running into issues several semesters down the line because of how things shake out for the period from Spring '20 - Spring '21.

Yeah I can see it. Although most classes that do offer optional review sessions tend to be harder in difficulty. For me personally, that usually means that I attend the class as frequently as possible.

I use an app called BeFocused that has me work for 25 minutes then take a 5 minute break. This repeats 4 times and then I get a 25 minute break. This is good especially for huge study sessions like before finals. Your brain will not retain information and you will not be as effective if you are not being wise about how your use it. Also important - do stupid shit you only get to do in college. Take this as you wish, and if it means turning in an assignment or two late, then by all means do it. You only live once and who cares about accounting anyways.

I'm so sorry, I can only imagine what that's like :( As far as senioritis, unfortunately, my solution was to overload myself with courses to the breaking point to avoid noticing it. &#x200B; Spoiler: it did not work, not even a little bit.

Pritchard, beer can, and ambulance. Name a better trio.

The world feels normal again for a few minutes

Welcome back to another episode of “Tonight at Pritchard”

Ahhhh, some things never change (lived in Pritchard 1994-95). Just need to add a 3am fire alarm as the icing on the cake.

Fun fact: VT Rescue’s first call on record (ever) was to Pritchard. Someone dropped a refrigerator on their foot.

Other than chipotle ranch, fantastic frank, and chicken parm at Owens, there isn’t a more iconic trio

Cursed images

What happened this time

can’t expect anything less

Pritchard, dumpster, fire

New school year, same old Pritchard

Why I don’t feel surprised?

The holy trinity

VT Students, Parties, Death

Slusher, beer can, abulance...

What does meme means after the post headline?

if i could give you reddit gold for this comment, i would

Today, a guy vomits next to my stall, where I'm taking a lovely shit, and left without bothering to flush his disgusting puke.. *Back to you*

https://lastpritchardfirealarm.carrd.co/?fbclid=IwAR0cUwEGU4fjHui1CpnT5FwzfmDHbLdaqeSrUdq_HLr-v-daZJn8uoP9pz4 In case you want updates on the next 3 AM fire alarm.

In February, at that.

Did they drop it on their foot while trying to throw it into the pit?

Pritchard, beer can, and an ambulance

At least the dude puked in the bathroom instead of the elevator.

I found a gallon of Jaegermeister puke in a urinal on a midnight piss run once, only cuz it splashed weird. Figured it was in a stall, cuz that was where it usually ended up. 0/10

Just sat on the toilet with ketchup packets between the seat and cover soo there’s that

> The record for the amount of fire alarms triggered in one week in the 2020-2021 school year is 3 times Those are rookie numbers. Spring 2013 the fire alarm went off so often, my gf at the time preferred to sleep with me, my roommate, and his girlfriend in the same dorm room, over sleeping in her room. She had no roommates at the time.

Ah, thanks. That explains it :)

Once a week is Prichard in the off season

In my sophomore year in West AJ, the fire alarm was getting pulled so often one night that they just stationed a response vehicle outside so they could turn off the alarm quicker. The very next day the put a goo like ink substance on the back of the pull, in hopes that they could catch whoever was pulling the alarm. But the record If I can remember was 8 times that night beginning at midnight and ending at almost 7 in the morning.

Hokie House in 1970

[Source](http://that70sblacksburg.blogspot.com/2013/11/the-hokie-house.html). Edit: this is from 1967, not 1970, as another commenter pointed out

I will always love Hokie House and their 2$ doubles

No shit lol, that's cool. Where is this? Is it still the same location, just underdeveloped?

This is so cool, I used to get my hair cut downstairs From 06-2010

Thanks OP! I wonder when they added the second floor.

The photo is from 1967 not 1970

Whoa - awesome!

photoshop so it says hokie home pls

$3 as of 2017 😭

looks like the same spot on the hill, just with no surrounding buildings or sidewalk.

Same but from 97-01. With the old guy who chatted your ear off!

I was a frosh in '91 and the second floor was there then, so it was a while back.

You're right

Disappointing, but I would still take that over DC area drink prices haha

He’s Still there, that’s where I get my hair cut

Going back to the burg after graduating and living in DC, it was like all rounds on me, this is amazing. Bburg prices are insanely cheap.

Damn he must be really old if someone called him old 20 years ago

Its the easiest way to feel like you're balling out like a king

Seriously... I went back last fall for the UVA game('04 alum, been out in Denver for 12 years, and hadn't been to BBurg in 8-10y) I was astounded by how cheap everything was! I had assumed everything would be more expensive now but that place is like a time capsule for the dollar. We got brunch at Boudreaux's, a meal and bloody, tax and tip for like $20!

Definitely. I never realized it when I was there.

And Boudreaux’s is expensive for Blacksburg

Yeah it's absolutely wild.

Savor the memory, word is that Boudreaux's probably won't be back after the pandemic. Several other restaurants are teetering on the edge and may not survive the loss of business and income.

Yeah spending $30 in a night out in blacksburg was so much at the time... now it’s like 2 drinks + tip lol

My roommate and I used to freak the fuck out if we both spent $15 in a night. Like, “oh no, we can’t eat this week” freak out.

We will prevail. We are Virginia Tech.

As George S. Patton once said, " It is foolish and wrong to mourn the \[people\] who died. Rather we should thank God that such \[people\] lived." Never met them or heard anything about them, to me they were just that, but they were somebody's loved ones and didn't deserve to be taken be like that. Nobody Does.

When was this picture taken?

[obligatory](https://youtu.be/O-Qx9dIr-68)

Someone please tell me this pic is not from today

> Never met them or heard anything about them, to me they were just that, but they were somebody's loved ones and didn't deserve to be taken be like that. We still remember. I knew [Ryan Clark](https://www.weremember.vt.edu/biographies/clark.html) (Stack) from my time in the MV's in the early 2000's. > At Virginia Tech, Ryan maintained a 4.0 GPA and earned a bachelor of science with a triple major in psychology, biology, and English. He was also a distinguished campus leader. He played the baritone in the Marching Virginians university band and was a resident advisor in West Ambler Johnston Hall. He also was an advisor in the Imaginarium programming resource center and worked at West End Market. He was the best of us.

Last year I believe.

Definitely wasn't today.

It might be controversial, but I wanted to thank you for saying it. I think it’s something that we all need to keep in mind. Killers aren’t born, they’re created. All of us, both Hokies as well as society as a whole, need to do better to prevent things like this from happening in the future.

I totally get where you're coming from but I think there's a few things to also consider here: For me, most notably would be how would the survivors (parents/friends) feel about their loved one's memorial being right next to him? How would the victims feel about it? I'm aware some of the parents have come out and said that they forgive him but I'd consider that a coping mechanism. As for him not being born a killer, and the below comment of killers being created, I think there are a lot of psychiatrists that would disagree. There are people who are brought up in the most loving households by parents and siblings that dote on them and they still go on to be psychopaths. Cho was a fucked up individual from birth and I remember his family back in South Korea attesting to it. He was a popular kid in middle school in NoVa and still hated everyone. When Columbine happened, he was fascinated by it and wanted to "out do" them. He started writing things in his notebooks about how he wanted everyone to burn in hell. He was identified by his professors as a problem but since he didn't do anything overtly violent, legally there was nothing they could do. He was flagged in systems, removed from classes (including Nikki Giovanni's) and asked to get help at Cook several times. They couldn't force him to do so. To say "we (VT)" failed him is an insult to all the people who tried to help him in my opinion. That said, I applaud the compassion and spirit and type this with no ill feelings to others who may have different views.

This is a compassionate sentiment but I believe they did the right thing. There have been no protests to add a stone but I'm willing to bet there would be protests to remove one if there were 33. Hokie Nation still hurts from this and it will never be completely understood. With the memorial at the heart of campus for everyone to experience is a true testament that We will Never Forget! Go HOKIES!

I knew Ryan as well in 2004-2005 when I was just a freshman. Still hard to believe this whole thing actually happened.

Yep, it was also posted on the VT Instagram where they confirmed that. A shame that we couldn’t honor their memories like this again, but we still remember

>The way the community came together and the compassion shown for absolutely everyone touched by that day make me more proud to be a hokie than I can put into words. When this happened, I remember thinking to myself "This is absolutely awful but if there's a community that can withstand it, it's Blacksburg." I've lived in small towns and big cities alike and there's been no place like it.

I always love this meme, but I'm not sure the claim is true. If anything, it seems like it's about Maryland(!) > According to SongFacts.com, John Denver had never visited either state when he recorded “Country Roads,” his first big hit, in 1971. The song was actually written by two musician friends of his, Bill Naffert and Taffy Nifert, who drove Clopper Road on their way to Gaithersburg, Maryland. In the late 1960s, Clopper Road was a single one-lane road passing through picturesque countryside. Today, much of the road is a busy four-lane highway. https://www.blueridgeoutdoors.com/go-outside/country-roads-west-or-western-virginia/ ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

Plus the road in question that inspired John Denver is Clopper Road, and road in Maryland

Moonshine capital of the world -> Franklin county, VA. Shenandoah river -> Mostly in VA, touches maryland, wVA. Blue Ridge Mountains -> barely in Maryland, not in wVA. The facts check out, it's about southwest VA.

What the fuck is a *west Virginia*?

I love this

This is a podcast about the song. https://www.wvpublic.org/podcast/country-roads-take-me-inside-appalachia

It's still a great song though. Too bad it got co-opted by Cletus.

I call bullshit. How the fuck is someone just gonna drive through the Maryland countryside, enjoy it so much they decide to write a song, and specifically reference West(ern) Virginia in said song with no mention of Maryland?

Because, you know. That's what the state of Maryland is known for. Its mountains.

It’s about I-81

It's Normal Virginia's malformed vestigial twin.

The opposite of east virginia obv

Tf do you want me to source? Use your brain dawg. A 4 lane highway that runs from Maryland through SWVA

Are you suggesting that "Today, much of the road is a busy four-lane highway." Refers to i81? It doesn't. It's referring to how Clopper Road is no longer a country road. Besides 81 barely existed in the 60s when the song was written.

If 81 barely existed, I think that would push it towards the country road category...

Barely existed as in wasn't fully built/open. It's an interstate; it is never a country road. An interstate opens as at least a 4 lane limited access highway.

Well - they did commit to fewer desks per classroom.

I was in this class--teacher admitted he hadnt attended any orientation stuff for the teachers, nor had he checked that his classroom would be large enough for the number of students, nor was he reading all the emails about covid policy. real freaking bad

There should be comment here. The classroom was clearly set up for less students so either the professor didn’t enforce his capacity limit or people showed up who weren’t supposed to.

Just wanted to check-in with everyone here and pass along that the ECE department is aware of this unacceptable incident. The College of Engineering and the university administration are aware as well and actions like this will not be tolerated.

This stinks. We clowned current Hokies for partying and packing in to Hokie House, but more energy should be directed at the school for allowing something like this to happen. Kids attending a class they need and paid for, shouldn’t be packed in a room and sitting on the floor.

Are we just going to ignore the earring mask holder?

Sounds like Dr. Xu should be getting an unpaid vacation after this. If students can get suspended for not following the rules, so should faculty. Let's hope that ECE does the right thing. If one of these students comes down with COVID from this, it will be very bad news for everyone.

[Same room as this one, so it sounds like the professor chose to not give a fuck. Cool. ](https://twitter.com/mikeypsamps/status/1297928669147664384?s=21)

where is this?

Welcome to a $30,000 kindergarten! Crisscrossed applesauce!

Report this instructor the the executive vice provost or vice provost for faculty affairs immediately.

This was my class, it’s electrical theory with Xu Yong... he came out and told all the students waiting outside the class room “we are going to break the rules today so everyone come in and stand around the room” so I just left and reporting him bc that’s some BULLSHIT. Also he told the class he has no idea what he’s doing or how many people were actually in the class

Oh, haven't you heard? Ut Prosim fixes everything

Are they doing a lab? Building something? I don't see anything instructionally spectacular or physically necessary that couldn't have been done online. I'm all for in-person stuff normally and when needed but this picture is like a 2020 college version of "A meeting that could have been an email"

Waiting for the Tech press release that will explain how the off-campus students are to blame for this.

Don’t worry guys, ut prosim

Defeats the purpose....Totally different from my class experience today.

This is so stupid. I'm so sorry for you all that are attending right now..

YOU GET COVID, YOU GET COVID, EVERYONE IN THE ROOM GETS COVID!!

Holy shit what a mess

Yeah, the professor doing this sucks. The administration letting him doing it in the first place is worse.

To report issues with classroom instruction and/or issues with faculty: Students should go to the Dean of Students (dean.students@vt.edu) and faculty should go to their respective dept heads. Faculty Affairs (facultyaffairs@vt.edu) can also help.

How many students?

This looks just like mcb 100 when they put 613 students in the class :)))

Yeah I was in this class. It’s ECE 2054, crn 83316. It has space for 80 students on hokiespa. 78 enrolled. There were 28 desks. The professor (Yong Xu) admitted being hadn’t been keeping up with emails and faculty COVID training. He asked us what other classes were doing, and what, if anything, the university had told us. We also received an email from the college apologizing for the screw up and promising to investigate what happened. I wouldn’t normally blame profs for something like this, it seems like a registration screw up, but I’m shocked that he was allowed to and chose to ignore the university’s communications.

Glad you posted it buddy

While im relieved that people are wearing masks its still not enough to curb COVID19. Theres practically no social distancing here. Both the teacher/faculty and the students are at fault here. If i was a student for this class knowing this is how wed have to sit i would have used my f\*\*\*ing common sense and left. Yall would be naiive to think that we could have in person classes like this and not have cases of COVID19.

why r u on the floor tho?

Looks like we’re all going home...

I thought it was bad when there was one kid with his nose out and no one was addressing it including the professor. That should be reportable lmao.

What professor is this

Omg that’s so sad

Well this is concerning... I have one in person class this semester and I really hope it doesn't look like this.

UPDATE: The class is now being taught over zoom, and there is a different prof (at least while they investigate who screwed this one up)

Trying to get my opinion out, but having a hard time. [https://www.reddit.com/r/VirginiaTech/comments/igneeo/i\_was\_the\_one\_who\_posted\_the\_picture\_of\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/VirginiaTech/comments/igneeo/i_was_the_one_who_posted_the_picture_of_the/)

Looks like productive learning to me

Yo im in this picture

This sub has completely turned into shit on VT, shit on fellow students, we’re all going to be sent home to die sub. We get it. People aren’t following the rules. Time to find something else to whine about.

Dudes should offer the seats to the women. Chivalry is dead.

Hey now.... let's everyone try to stay positive. Masks work, so everyone will be just fine.

Sorry to highjack, but trying to get my opinion out and having a hard time. This morning I was approached by a reporter for WSLS 10 about the picture that I posted to this subreddit yesterday. I agreed to an interview as long as my opinion was accurately portrayed. **It was not.** Although they did take direct quotes from me, they did not accurately represent my opinion of the situation. I now want to clarify my point of view since the interview was cherry picked to fit their narrative. First of all I wanted to make it exceedingly clear that I do not believe anyone should lose their job or career over what happened yesterday. I said this at the very beginning of the interview and made it very clear that I wanted it to be known that this was my stance on it. Everyone that entered that room took a **personal choice** to do so, and I believe that everyone should always have the freedom to make their own personal choices. The responsibility should fall on each individual. If you want to take classes online, take classes online. If you want to take classes in person, take them in person. Second; my biggest issue about the situation was that I didn't have a seat to sit in... WSLS made it appear that I thought this was an absolute tragedy and strictly about Covid-19 exposure. If I didn't feel safe in that room, **I would not have entered it.** I talked about how sometimes logistics break down and we as a society run into problems. We all make mistakes, even the interviewer shook my hand when they shouldn't have. We need to be very careful that we are not inventing solutions that are worse for us than the original problem. I talked about how people are avoiding going to the hospital for life threatening medical emergencies because they are so afraid of Covid-19. I also stated that I believe that the current strategy is putting more students at risk for depression and possible suicide than the risks they face from Covid-19. The majority of cases at VT are antibody cases which means that you have already gotten over it. Everyone I talk to on campus is desperate for social interaction, they are extremely stressed about their grades because there are less opportunities to study with a group. Third; I stated that I do think that VT and Blacksburg should not be requiring masks in the city on sidewalks and that they have been unfairly strict on students. I don't believe masks should be mandated, but **I do think you should choose to wear a mask**. I stated that trying to keep college students from partying is like prohibition; it simply will not work. A large part of the college experience is socializing, and not necessarily partying and drinking either. I commend VTs efforts to try to give us as much of a college experience as they can. Finally, I discussed with the interviewer how the political environment and media are doing exactly what they did to me today. They are twisting everything to fit their point of view, to the point that it is exceedingly obvious. People are losing faith in our government and our media, which means less people are trusting the advice given by the media and government. **TL;DR Biased media is biased. See you in person, in class, tomorrow. :)** [https://www.wsls.com/news/local/2020/08/25/photo-of-crowded-classroom-worries-some-virginia-tech-students/](https://www.wsls.com/news/local/2020/08/25/photo-of-crowded-classroom-worries-some-virginia-tech-students/)

I was in this class too but I guess I came after he said this or I didn't hear him. Interesting that he wasn't up-to-date with this stuff

It looks like the canvas page up on screen. I can just barely make out "applied ... theory" Anyone know what the other word might be? Edit: Found it in another comment down below. It was on [Twitter][1]: Applied Electrical Theory. Xu Yong. [1]: https://mobile.twitter.com/mikeypsamps/status/1297928669147664384?s=21

or, and hear me out here: someone screwed up the registration system

RIP Sub Station II Sad for Blacksburg/VT but well deserved for Hamid.

Booking a trip to Blacksburg purely so I can have one of those subs for the last time. Nothing else out there hits quite like them. RIP to a real one, but best wishes for Hamid. Also shout out to their website for barely changing since 2006.

I'm glad that Hamid is doing it to retire and not because he has to.

This man deserves a statue or building named after him on campus.

We're losing a good one But he has earned his rest

Damn, had many hungover lunches there.

Chicken salad on rye got me through grad school, that's a damn shame. Sometimes the employees would just mess with people who asked where Sub Station I was. Sometimes they would say it was in Christiansburg, sometimes it burned down, sometimes it was rebuilt on that location.

RIP to one of the best in the burg

I've been going to SSII since just a couple years after it opened. Hamid is the GOAT: hands-on, diligent and always grateful for your business. I hope he enjoys his retirement. ...but no more #19 subs? How will I go on?

NOOOOOOOOO - but in all seriousness, best wishes for his retirement

Definitely gonna miss the place, although I hadn't eaten there in years (moving diagonally across the country will do that). Congrats and happy, restful retirement to Hamid!

Truly devastating, but I hope he enjoys his retirement!

I've been in BB for years but never tried it. What should I order?

That’s sad… those sandwiches were my late night study sesh fuel. I all but lived in the Chemistry Learning Center my junior and senior years for those sweet wall to wall white boards and I would get a foot long on their honey wheat to help me keep going until (often) it was time to catch the last bus to my apartment.

The guy created a local Institution … and then the tough part: Kept it going for nearly 4 decades! It'll be missed.

Rip. So many fond memories. Pouring one out for you Hamid

One of the few places that have been here longer than me. If anyone deserves an awesome retirement, it's Hamid. I wonder if he will sell to anyone.

Nooo that’s been my go to place the last couple years!

Loved going there while a TA in Major Williams in the late 90s.

With McAlister's and Sub Station both closed, what's the next best deli in the area? Trying to find a worthy Reuben replacement.

RIP you will be missed 🫶

I am going to take my residents there so they can have at least experienced it once before it ends.

I have been eating their since I was a kid. Another one bites the dust. Mike’s was the first big loss and this one is just as bad.

Anyone know what's gonna happen to the building?

Guess I gotta grab a sub, never had one from here before. Sad news, but good on him that he’s retiring. He deserves it.

I miss that place :(

:( Sub station is the best. I'm glad he's retiring though, and that this isn't about poor sales.

I’ve never been so sad

Nooooooo, wow, that sucks. They provided a significant portion of my food during my most recent stint in Blacksburg - definitely need to make a trip up to get a last sub on my way home for the holidays

Happy retirement Hamid! Sad to see it go though.

So, I put in an application to continue store operations and even received a phone call from the CEO the morning after. However, they made it clear that the building location is no longer available and cannot be reused for the franchise. I'm assuming any available vacant locations are far enough off-campus from general student/faculty traffic that it's not worth the investment. Sorry folks. :(

This been around for years as I watched AGP 💔

Petition to change Lane Stadium to Hamid Stadium?

Just down the street is the (wholly unrelated) Sub Station for VT Electric Service. Sign and everything.

Any cold cut sub. Their hot subs are fine but the cold cuts are where it’s at. They are known for their #19…basically a super Italian. But don’t sleep on the turkey and cheese. My favorite is roast beef turkey and cheese. Lunch specials on weekdays. 8.50 for a 6 inch, chips, and fountain drink. Go to the website to see sub of the day for lunch special. Today is turkey. Tomorrow is ham and salami.

The special

I always get the special. Though #13 (ham, salami, pepperoni) is my go to which is the special on Fridays (or at least it used to be).

Not sure if they have Reubens but the Milk Parlor has great grilled cheese and you can still get a tugboat there as a secret menu item

PKs has a decent Ruben. But never tried the substation ruben. Honestly cold cuts at SS are where it’s at.

What took over Mike’s?

I love it!!

Do they got any good vegetarian options?

Nothing really. The redid the whole complex.

Maroon Door occupies the space that used to be Mike's and Cooks Cleaner that was next door. As the other poster said it's been remolded so it looks nothing like Mike's.

Their cheese sub got me through grad school

Stay safe Hokies.

I live in Charllotsville not hard.

Having to constantly force myself to remember that this isn’t an extended summer break and we have to actually do work now

[Try to stay brave ...](https://youtu.be/x08Fl_mDNkI?t=62)

It's so hard for me to pay attention in my zoom lectures, and I have 2 assignments and a midterm due tonight. Uuugggghhhh so hard to focus!!!

I mean i’m still sleeping in every day cuz most of my classes are “go at your own pace” type things lol

what sucks the most is it's not even like I have more free time. I just do everything at home now.

I gotta say I'm loving working from home, but that's totally different.

I have an extra hour each day now that I don't have to wait for the bus/take the bus. And I'm using that extra hour on sleep.

Ah the privilege to not have to work over summer break. I could dream

Tell me about, I fucking missed my midterm

zoom lectures aren't even the worst of it for me. most of my classes just make videos so at least with the zoom lectures being live i can feel obligated to focus

I find to stay motivated make really pretty notes to trick yourself into paying attention to lectures. Or ask your prof to do some sort of topics sheet/guided notes for video lectures

As someone who just cranked out a biology project in a single, caffeine/nicotine/adderall fueled hour, I relate.

Memorial for boy who died Hi all. There’s currently a memorial of flowers and other items for the student who died from getting hit by that truck the other day. It’s at the same spot he was hit. If you can, please feel free to leave flowers, letters/notes, and other gifts in remembrance of his life. ❤️ his name was Franklin Zhang and he was a freshman from Canada. The whole situation is incredibly tragic and it makes me feel really sad to think about. I hope he’s resting peacefully.

My heart goes out to his loved ones. I can’t imagine the pain. Hokies, please be safe!

My heart is broken, as a mom, for this boy and his family

Thank you for sharing.

Such a tragedy. My condolences to his family, I can’t imagine what they’re going through right now.

he sat next to me in math :( we weren’t friends or anything but you could tell he was a smart guy

My thoughts and prayers to his family!

Heartfelt sympathy to his family and all who knew him.

Where exactly is the memorial site?

I watched almost the entire thing happen inside of a bus as a bystander. Very tragic rest in peace

That is terrible. Rest in peace Mr. Zhang and condolences to family and friends at such a difficult time.

On prices fork, right next to the Buffalo wild wings

It’s still being investigated but from what we do know the truck did flip over and another car was involved in the accident :(

There’s lots of different articles about the incident and many witnesses. He got hit a few feet from the pole presumably waiting for the bus. The truck also didn’t hit the pole because it didn’t drive into it, it flipped over and hit the victim. Regardless, someone who attended our university died (who was very much a human being with dreams and aspirations just like any of us) and it’s gross that your reaction to this tragedy is to question the location he got hit.

I watched them repair it a few days ago while I was on the way to class - and I also saw the accident, the pole was indeed hit and thats where the incident happened.

I hope you are not a Hokie because that statement goes against everything Ut Prosim stands for. Do better and be a better person.

Not everything is a conspiracy.

It does go against everything I stand for, that guy is a dick!

Rage bait used to be believable.

Your idea of great is different than most. The “great” you are looking for doesn’t exist here. Try Russia.

Agree with you there. Although, I will add that I don't usually consider POSs like u/[One\_Investigator\_796](https://www.reddit.com/user/One_Investigator_796/) human anyway. I'm just surprised to see that seemingly low-level life forms like [One\_Investigator\_796](https://www.reddit.com/user/One_Investigator_796/) have evolved enough to be able to post comprehensively on reddit. Truly biological... miracles/curses? Idk.

to the freshman who stopped me on campus today and asked if I was lost and needed help finding a building: thank you! that was very kind of you :) I’m a senior...

That was very Ut Proism of them tho

I’m a grad student so I hardly ever go to the dining halls but last year I stopped by HokieGrill to get food and I guess I looked confused because the ladies working at the BBQ place asked if I was a freshman and I was very flattered because I have not been a freshman in undergrad since 2009 😂

were you wearing a big backpack, campus map, and a lanyard ID?

I've been here for 22 years and I still don't know the buildings

It was the what’s a hokie I am shirt wasn’t it

Well, we are waiting.... were you?

Not all koalas who wander are lostkoalas!

Username checks out

Question - did you confirm this person was a freshman or are you making a reciprocal assumption? Maybe you're both seniors and this is the beginning of a just awful rom com.

My wife and I graduated 5 years ago and we get season tickets in East stands right next to the students. One asked my wife if she was a freshman or a sophomore

i was walking back from taco bell with my roommate, and a freshmen outside waffle house asked me if we were lost...im a junior and my roommate is a senior lol

Well...did you get the help you needed?

A senior being lost? r/unexpected .

bruh i haven’t even set foot on campus lol

Time to petition Reddit for an ut prosim award

baby-face gang!!!

I used to get asked if I lost my orientation group once orientation came around, nearly every single year until I graduated. But I always appreciated the help!

I was on my phone so I guess I looked like I was looking for directions lolllll

Don't worry, with the way Tim Sands is changing the names of the buildings on campus nobody else does either.

LOL yeah we talked, they were a freshman, there was embarrassment all around

Look at this ...reddit is shadow banning this guys story

Well, I did get help...whether or not it was needed is debatable though!

I wasn’t lost but I guess I looked really heckin confused haha

Why is this so downvoted? lol

And THATS how you get hit on by a freshman!

How do you know it's been shadow banned?

There was a relatively small amount of evidence that Claudius Lee, who the building was named after, was a secret Klan member. Thus the building was renamed to avoid the controversy or make anyone feel unwelcome on campus.

oh god oh no

This is my second year living in a lounge

Off campus is calling your name

5 years in a row... and likely some before I got there

The dining halls are so crowded. There is no space to walk at all.

Who else living with an RA?

Same issues as every year. I imagine this year it's just twice as bad.

Ohh noo all local businesses are packed! That's like so bad and stuff. *sigh*

Lounges were used as far back as 2001.

I was a freshman in 2008 and they over admitted then too. Granted, it wasn’t as bad as this year - there were people in triples, common rooms, and they offered to let people live off campus.

This is why you gotta lunch at 11 or at 2/3. Turner at 12? Dont bother

West End is a joke. I've gone there three times at various times of day and always wound up walking out to go somewhere else because the lines wrapped around the building. VT was full of shit when they said they were "prepared" for the influx of diners.

What’s it like so far and what dorm are you in

There were people in triples when I was a freshman in 1991. Never heard of anyone living in lounges back then though.

Honestly I’m thinking of getting protein and cliff bars for between class, then eating a big lunch after my last class at 3:45 or eating right before that class at 2.

Even 1, Turner at 1 was decent.

East AJ. Not too bad he is pretty cool

Kevin Roberts, Project 2025 chief who warned 'second revolution' could become bloody, is a Virginia Tech graduate

...so is Steve Bannon... Edit: somebody else pointed this our before me, sorry I can't read

UVA grad here, if it makes you feel any better, we have Richard Spencer as a disavowed alumn. We’ve all got shithead alumni

Not very Ut Prosim of him

Yes, the guy saying that the revolution will be bloodless if liberals allow to be being a Tech alum is not a good look. This dude isn’t conservative, he’s a nut job.

You'll be shocked to learn that a lot of Tech grads are conservative. Steve Bannon is also a Tech grad. The growing influence of Fairfax County at Tech doesn't mean we all feel the same way.

UGA alum. Not sure why this was recommended. If it makes you feel any better, we got Marjorie Taylor Greene.

Ugh, so is Steve Bannon 🤢

Wow! Embarrassing!

Why does this information matter?

Shitty humans are everywhere.

Actually he said it would only be bloody if the left decided it would be

Convicted felon currently serving time Steve Bannon is too. Ut Prosim, am I right?

I can never let my sister find out about this (She is a uva student)

Two men, each sporting a micropenis, shaking hands.

That is unfortunate! Vote blue!

Imagine that, a school that has thousands upon thousands of graduates has a few you don’t like. Shocking!

No way!!! I don't believe that even at a pretty liberal college there are some conservatives!!! It's almost like not all people have the same viewpoints even if they come from the same area!!! Astonishing!

I’m buying a gun to protect myself. If they can have them I should have one for protection.

That checks out… def on brand

They should rescind his degree

The first revolution was bloody. Why wouldn't the second one be if it even happenes?

Who tf cares

Breaking news: The majority of college students do not care much about politics, and when politics are forced onto them will respond with annoyance

NOOOOOO SOMEONE DOESNT AGREE WITH ME BUT GOES TO MY SCHOOL WAHHH

So there actually are real people involved with project 25? I thought it was just a boogeyman made up from democratic operatives to get gullible people angry.

> This dude isn’t conservative, he’s a nut job. Like these are mutually exclusive positions. Conservatives are *all* fucking nut jobs today. Or did you miss the whole Republican Convention?

He isn't a conservative? Really?

Since when did we normalize political violence being a part of conservatism like it’s NBD. This dude isn’t getting a spotlight for pushing a flat tax rate policy. But okay sure, this is normal now.

P2025 isn’t conservative, it’s actually the exact opposite of that. They’re not trying to conserve anything, they’re looking to fundamentally transform the way this country functions at all levels. They’re technically a progressive movement, just not the kind of progress that is usually associated with that term, namely more equality and better standard of living for all. They’re trying to progress towards authoritarian rule.

There’s conservative, and then there are guys like Kevin Roberts and Steve Bannon. I have no doubt students at tech (and, indeed, every university) are conservative, but what’s notable is these guys are both a). controversial and b). insane.

Call me crazy - trying to overthrow the election isn’t conservative

I mean it’s true everywhere. Trump, Cruz, Youngkin, DeSantis, Cotton and a bunch more are all Ivy grads. Yet will turn around and decry the communist infiltration of the very Ivy schools they became so conservative in.

Steve Bannon is also a felon currently serving time in a CT prison for the next few months. Go Hokies!

Why drag Fairfax County into this? There are plenty of other blue areas in VA

But like, also Hota Kotb, and she seems chill

It doesn’t, OP just wants to inject politics where it doesn’t belong

Soda and hot pockets. The diet of champions

1 star. You got empty calories with all that soda (filled with aspartame). No fruits or veggies. No fiber. Frozen garbage full of preservatives. Try again.

I don’t really like the ham and cheddar hot pockets tbh

There are like only 2 good types of hot pockets, the meatball mozzarella and the pepperoni. If you buy any other you are (in my opinion) sadistic.

Pro Shot version of Enter Sandman Lane Stadium May 7th 2025

So unbelievably fucking cool

Where is this clip from?

I only see 3 of them on stage? Where was Trujillo?

Full Length Version PLEASE!

Damn it! Where is the rest of it LOL! I was sick but so glad I forced myself to go. It was epic to say the least.

W clip, wish I was there

Will do anything but be good at football

Last night 5/7. They played a show at lane stadium.

The stage was donut-shaped, and the 4 of them were rarely standing in the same spot

They also rotated counterclockwise on the stage throughout the show. They started on West end and finished there.

Here's the best version I've seen from someone in the crowd that's from start to finish of Enter Sandman: Link: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FdWedjFnus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FdWedjFnus)

This was the only version I could find and it's from the Virginia Tech Facebook page. But if they recorded it like this then there's got to be more!

Shot I took of Torg Bridge in the snow.

New phone lock screen

😍😍😍 Flawless shot!

Do you perhaps have a link to a higher resolution version of this? Amazing photo btw!

Great shot...even though I have always thought the Torg Bridge was an eyesore that permanently marred the view down the VT mall.

When virginia has more snow that chicago.

Oh cool. Was this the snow storm during finals week?

Thank you so much!

Correct haha

Unless reddit degrades the quality this should be my max, but if not here it is on [flickr](https://flic.kr/p/2cCSRxz)

Right? I'm in Wisconsin and there's nothing here. This snow before finals week is the most I've seen this winter.

Yes it was, couldn't resist going out to shoot it.

I'm gonna miss it when I'm gone thats for sure

Seconded. Beautiful picture!

Thank you I appreciate it!

She would like to speak with Lane’s manager

Who knew lane stadium was the 5th floor of the Library

Not the wine and cheese crowd they're used to in Chapel Hill lol

This seems like satire.

Lane stadium is rated one of the most intimidating places to play for a reason

Is that not the point of a football stadium?

A non-Covid related shitting on UNC is much welcome. Thank you

Well your players and coaches dream of it. Take the L.

If she wants to enjoy a silent crowd she should head to Charlottesville and catch a UVA game.

I see she is one of the south side favorites. South side seats. The best place to sit and politely watch a Tech game

good fuck this lady

That's the fucking point lady

More like Tar Squeal!!!

Tar Heel? I think she misspelled “Karen”

Lmfao, I guess she doesn’t know what home field advantage means. Or has never watched a home game for any NFL team, perhaps try watching a home game for the Seattle Seahawks, whiner

In terms of football, your absolutely right totally dead. I’ve been to a few duke unc basketball games though and let me tell you………

"This Tar Heel will not be returning." Problem report closed. Working as intended.

As someone from the Triangle, there is very little school spirit compared to VT, especially for such a rivalry that should exist between the three big schools in that area (UNC, NCSU, Duke). I've been to a few home games at all three schools and they are just so damn boring. Sorry this lady never went to a real football game.

Lol clearly this lady has never been to a football game before

This is the most insane W for us I’ve ever seen

She can watch from Newman Library next year.

I honestly can’t tell if this is trolling or real, the Karen dilema.

Lack of Goth Girls As a freshman boy at Virginia Tech, I am saddened at the lack of goth girls who attend here. The majority of girls here are Blonde Taylor Swift Starbucks girls who seem to lack personality and originality. The underrepresentation of the goth girl subculture at VT is likely tied to a few aspects, how it is notorious for its partying, (not typically a goth girl interest) the constant vibrant and sunny atmosphere, (ditto), and the overall lack of diverse appeal. I know that my fellow VT male brethren are also disappointed at the lack of goth mommies here, they likely just conceal their pain better than I am capable of. Every single day I wake up and do my morning prayer hoping to spot an emo goth girl somewhere around campus, but alas, to no avail. Perhaps I am merely looking in the wrong places. If anyone knows where to find them please message me ASAP. Or if you are a goth girl reading this, don’t be afraid to shoot me a DM. I believe without finding a goth girl my mental health will continue to plummet and I’m afraid to know what I’m capable of if that happens. I may have to look into transferring if this issue does not get resolved. Any tips are much appreciated, thanks! edit: Thank you all for your participation and input, it was very enlightening! credit goes to u/MedicalInspector6374 and please do not message me as I am just a girl...

What did I just read Edit: nvm I approve

Shoulda gone to vcu my man

New copypasta just dropped

May not work for you, but this is how I’ve found and bagged. For finding goth women, hit up Milk Parlor for band nights, find local bands chat and find your way to the house shows. Start skating, going out more, and you’ll find goth girls eventually. As for tips on how to bag, I’d start with making sure you’re a drug addict(this helps A LOT). Once you see a goth girl that you’d let peg, cut, and abuse you. Find your balls and go up to them. I always start off with telling them I dig whatever seems to have taken the longest to style or find. They’ll eat this up if they dig u. Following this, I transition to music. It’s imperative to have some form of “something about life isn’t so great” music taste(metal, certain rock, and maybe some hyper-pop). Talk about your interest in some songs and make sure to ask them what they like. Then act interested, etc. If everything has gone smoothly, you hit ‘em with the “you smoke?” If they do, invite them to yours. If yes, get there, turn on the tunes ask ‘em to play some shit, roll up, and mission success. It’s imperative you don’t misgender and that you match the clothing vibe. Good luck virgin🫡

Why isn't Tim Sands looking into this?

Former goth/industrial girl here. I see that nothing has changed since 1997 - 2002 when I was at VT. In my case, I used to settle for emo/punk or jock types that just happened to like metal, etc. until I finally met a fellow goth/industrial guy 3.5 years in. Married him in 2002 and we're still together with a house, kids, etc. These days we look/dress like "normal" people so that we can keep jobs that pay for it all. However, our music tastes are the same and we went to see Skinny Puppy and Depeche Mode this year. This advice is 20+ years old, but it seemed like the few goth/industrial girls were architecture, interior design, biology or chemistry majors (in general, look for smart girls and you'll find goth girls). My husband and the other couple of goth guys he was friends with were CS or engineering majors. We both avoided business majors like the plague.

Pull up to some shows at XYZ Gallery man! There you'll find a higher concentration of VT art hoes, and by proxy goth girls than most other spots in the area.

So true bestie

This is a major problem that we as a society need to solve

lmfaooo me n my roommate were talking bout the goth mommy drought a few days ago

They work at Eats and a lot of the coffee/tea shops in the area.. You’re at the wrong college for goth mommies 🫥

ik this is a joke and as a goth/alt girlie this is p funny, but we don’t gotta put down other girls w/ different aesthetics to make a joke :((( this metal mommy loves the swiftie girlies hahah

thanks for the credit 😂

I’ve never felt so appreciated, I will definitely now be wearing my tattoo choker a little more often

As a goth woman, agreed.

Consider transferring to a northern Midwest university (Madison, UofM, Chicago, Michigan, etc…). That’s where I found mine.

Lol your gonna transfer because you can't find a goth girl?

You’re super edgy using derogatory and dehumanising terms against white girls, this is very rebellious of you.

Anniversary Gifts: Gothic Edition Ever since Aleister Crowley wrote the definitive list of wedding anniversary gifts in 1899, the tradition has carried on with presents of Paper for the first anniversary, Gold for the 50th, Diamond for the 60th, and many fun ventures in between. But what can the discerning goth give a loved one or polycule for their anniversary while avoiding the common Victorian tradition? Here is the official list by the most famous goth of all, Orval Madden: 1- Spider-Themed Jewelry 2- Black Leather Or PVC 3- One (1) Vincent Price Movie On VHS 4- Barnes & Noble’s Leatherbound “Complete Works of Edgar Allan Poe” 5- Cloth Cut From A Condemned Clergyman, Or A Nice Hourglass With A Little Silver Skull On It 10- Darkness, Sadness, And Pain (Written In Calligraphy On Framed Parchment) 20- Bloodborne for PS4, Or One (1) Tear From Your Cheek In A Glass Vial 30- Complete Skeleton Of A Small Animal, Or One (1) Human Bone 40- All Siouxsie “MixTape” On A Wax Phonograph Cylinder 50- Live Bats 60- Your First Childhood Toy, Damaged By Time And Neglect, Which Once Unveiled Reminds You Of The Last Time You Felt Hope And Grew Painfully Beyond it, Declaring That You Would No Longer Feel, Only Days Later Meeting Your True Love, Tragically Forever Unable To Embrace Them With Anything More Than A Sad Memory Of What You Once Believed Love Could Be. 66- Bela Lugosi’s Corpse

Wait wait he has a point

Bud with the Hot take 🔥

As a moderator I really try to make it a point to stay out of political discussions here. At this point though all I can say is I truly agree with Bud. I've had more productive arguments with people on Reddit over anime.

not a hot take, just a sad one

I wonder if this election will have the lowest turnout ever or the highest

Being not political is not a good thing. If you don't engage others will engage on your behalf. Get active and be informed.

the debate was pain, no matter who you support

He's not wrong. I wonder if debates were ever good. Right now there's a strong incentive to debate with the goal of getting some juicy clip for Twitter and Facebook later, which I'm sure doesn't help, but I don't know that human nature was any different 40 years ago either.

When the orange clown acts like a petulant child, it won’t make for great debate Who’d a thunk

I thought it was hilarious ... def a shit show

Lol 2 mins turned into like 20 seconds Bc of all the interrupting

Honestly, the format of the debate doesn't bother me. 2 minutes is not a great amount of time, but with the number of topics they talk about, it seems fair. My problem with this debate in particular is was the candidates acting like CHILDREN for an hour and a half.

Slice of life animes are the best. Fight me.

Just stand back and stand by.

Demon Slayer is good, but severely overrated. Come at me.

I feel as though the only people who can afford to not be political are the privileged. The rest of us must care, must educate ourselves, must vote.

being not political is just fine if you accept the outcomes and live within it regardless of what happens. there is nothing wrong with that; everyone has different priorities. what is not a good thing is not being involved or informed and then bitching when things aren't the way you'd like. edit: yes, my viewpoint comes from a place of privilege. Not everyone is in a position to thrive by being politically idle.

Human nature was not different but the idea of how one was expected to act in different public settings was. People did the same stuff hell they were probably worse behind closed doors but in public they had to act as if they were not shit people.

I went back and watched the debate from 2012 between Romney and Obama. World’s different. I miss strong and civil leadership. I really do. That’s not even angled toward one or the other.

It was definitely more a case of a Child debating an adult.

Well... 1) You're wrong 2) Action/Adventure is best 3) Jk^I^actually^like^them^too. ^^^^^Gimme ^^^^^recommendations...

I absolutely agree that everyone needs to care and make every effort at advancing political education. However, the ability to engage in politics is itself a privilege in our system- leading to the wonderful contradiction that those who can least afford to not engage in politics often can't afford to engage in politics. Learning political theory, keeping up with current events, and organizing political actions take time and money. If you're a working mother making minimum wage, you have neither. If you're a well-off suburban housewife, you have both. It's only when things get *really* bad that those with the least free time and money to spend are going to use it to affect political change- leaving a political system dominated by those with the privilege to engage in it, who will almost always use that domination to protect their privileges.

Your personal priorities do not outweigh your collective duties. We each have a personal responsibility to be active since our collective good depends on making educated and considered choices in the political sphere. If you believe that the people in these positions have no personal impact upon you and your priorities you are not paying attention.

I kinda want to go watch Biden v Ryan from the same year.

Yes, but don't blame the candidates. They probably only do it because it works. Blame the ~~fanboys~~ supporters and the voters.

Great teacher onizuka

I actually don't watch them much. These days, I'd enjoy any suggestions as well as they are less depressing than real life. Nana was solid. The DVDs are hard to find. I might have a torrent hash. Ouran Host Club

K-On! It's the best SOL anime that's... not really SOL because there's a lot of heart in it with the characters growing and facing problems in their years. More than just some moe show.

>e > >Kaze ga Tsuyoku Fuiteiru(Run with the Wind) is a pretty solid watch if you haven't checked it out. It's a mix between slice of life and sports. I've binged a lot of over quarantine and this one was one of the more memorable ones.

I think we have a fundamental misunderstanding of what bud meant by saying he is not political. I am sure he has educated himself and votes one way or another. My understanding is that he's not the type to follow politicians' every move and analyze every policy proposal or career history. He's not attending any rallies or the like. You can still be informed and involved by voting without having to partake in all the nonsense. And you can still learn to live within a system that didn't provide the outcome you wanted until your next opportunity to participate; you don't have to be constantly fighting for change if you have other priorities. That's how I read his statement and what I based my comment on. I'm not saying you shouldn't vote, at minimum.

If you've never seen Your Lie in April, highly recommend starting with that one. Really sad, but good anime. Any time I hear a song from it, I instantly get hit with the feels, and it's been a few years since I last watched through. To add to your list though, watch Love is War (on Funimation and maybe Hulu?).

You ever watch Gintama? That’s easily my favorite.

>9 series since January. Here are the ones I ranked 10, 9, and 8 stars on Anyme. Just my particular taste. In my experience, the weird ones I put off because their name / premise ended up bei Long list, I don't agree with SAO, Darling in the FranXX started off really good but got shitty at the end, but I've pretty much binged the rest of the show on your list and agree

You say "fight me" on SAO, but the big red flag is darling in the franxx LOL

I was making a general comment. While I understand people are busy with many responsibilities we cannot afford to place our individual needs and comforts above the needs of all of us. We must spend more effort on doing for each other. Failure to participate in the political process ensures the invalidity of said process. It promotes a system that works for the few and against many. Being politically neutral or inactive in whatever form isn't cool anymore it is selfish.

Really? I've not seen much hate for that one. I thought it was a neat self-contained story that had better pacing than most. Why don't people like it?

Oooooooh, okay, so I have a lot to say. First, if you watch it, start with episode 3. The first two episodes aren’t really episodes and theyre just celebratory animations for getting turned into an anime. Second, this show is the funniest shit you will ever see. [Here’s an idea of what you can expect.](https://imgur.com/a/e5hGLP3) Third, most of the Gintama community agrees that it’s “slow.” Meaning, the later episodes are MUCH MUCH better than the earlier ones. This is not to say the early episodes are bad. They’re still fantastic. It’s just the later episodes are really that good. If you find you don’t like this show 30 episodes in, stop watching it. There’s no point in going on trying to get to the good stuff because there’s no guarantee the good stuff will even be “good” to you if you don’t like the less good stuff, if that makes sense. Fourth, this show has everything. It started out as a comedy, but it turned into a masterpiece Shonen. It’s funny, heart warming, heart breaking, intense, and everything in between. I am convinced that episodes 304-305, if you ever make it that far, are two of *the* best episodes in all of anime. Finally, the voice acting is as good as it gets. Grade A actors all around.

It had a lot of hype and promise at the start given the interesting plot and trigger animating it. The ending, though, was not well received by the community

Don’t touch the cenotaph. Shame on whoever this is. Genuinely. Only 3,400 US servicemen have ever earned the medal of honor. 8 of those were Tech alum and their names are on the cenotaph at the pylons. Don’t touch it. Don’t do this.

Do you think these people are reddit user or instagram users? They need to be told not to climb on cenotaphs for pictures, by a responsible society member who sees them doing it on site

Most experienced grad photoshoot photographers know this is forbidden and the person taking the photos is just as much to blame.

I had never heard the term cenotaph before reading this thread. Definitely not cool, but doubtful it was intentionally insensitive.

Here's the thing.. I highly doubt anyone told them. Rather than shaming them, educate them. If they were doing it intentionally, then sure shame them but most students sadly dont understand the meaning of the pylons or the cenotaph.

I agree but I also feel like this is a graduation photo, no? Shouldn’t a person know after 4 years that that would be awful to do?

I feel like if anyone sees someone doing this, it is 100% appropriate to bark ‘Get off the Cenotaph!’ In the most irate manner you can muster.

this photo is old / recycled for clicks

Yeah- shame on them. It’s very clearly labeled, and is very obvious that it’s a memorial with people’s names on it, and they defile it anyways. Those 8 brave men fought for them- fought and died, just for them to do stupid shit like this. Plus- they’re old enough to know what a cenotaph is. None of this “maybe they didn’t know it was a memorial” stuff.

Upon my first visitor tour / prospective student tour here at VT, I was made aware what the pylons and what the memorial stood for. When I had been accepted and attended orientation I was again reminded what these stood for through yet another tour. Upon living in my llc, my mentor then again took a group of us for a tour and yet again, reminded us what the pylons and memorial resembled. Using the excuse, "I've been here 4 years and didn't know what this was" is bs in my eyes. Even having not lived in any of the llc, or having not lived in the Corp, every undergrad student is made aware of the fact that this is VT. The pylons are smack in the middle of the campus. You can't be serious to say you don't know not to sit on a memorial? Even if you didn't know what these pylons and memorial meant, you will tell me to my face that for 4 years you walked by this memorial, and never asked yourself, "I don't know what this is for, let me search it up." Even if you don't give a crap, you perhaps didn't think, "hmmmm never seen anyone do this before, let me do it" The pylons ARE just as IMPORTANT to the "VT EXPERIENCE" as enter sandman in lane. In a school that is focused so much on community, this is absurd. Instead of just coming here to get wasted and go to a "football" school, maybe some of my peers should use their brains for a minute out of the day and think, "maybe this is not a good idea." To be honest, the pylons are the most important thing at this school alongside the April 16th memorial.

A former soldier who's known a couple MoH recipients... I think they'd get a kick out of hot girls posing on their memorial.

but look how hot I looked!!! - tee hee hee

If she’s taking senior pictures she definitely as a senior knew that you shouldn’t touch it, and anyone with common knowledge wouldn’t pose like that on top of a war hero memorial

Holy hell, I just was down there for a campus tour and our tour guide got so serious as soon as she told us not to touch the cenotaph, didn't think anyone would do it...Shame on them honestly

Hopefully she was educated on what ever socials she posted that image on. She's dumb and entitled but hey, great legs.

You need to send a picture of this to the office of student conduct. This is not okay on so many levels

Did OP say something to them or just take a photo and run to Reddit?

not a big deal to me honestly

The photographer looks like her mom so we can blame her on more than one account.

https://preview.redd.it/xrzjlafp4kye1.jpeg?width=442&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7cc576141039511a26cccf7a2f5c7bafbc023cd0 According to a FB post, this was the photographer.

It says it on the label in front of the stone. So not deliberately insensitive but definitely ignorant or plain old entitled.

The Corps requires cadets to know the name. There's a 24 hour rotating guard ceremony at least once a year. It's a big deal. Two Corps graduates died in the Iraq war and another Virginia Tech graduate who wasn't in the Corps. Ceremonies were held there. I'm sure not intentionally insensitive but it's the kind of thing that should get people fined or banned or both. Like Ozzy Osbourne getting arrested and fined $40 ($100 today) for urinating on the cenotaph at The Alamo. I think was just for public intoxication but the 10 year ban from San Antonio was for the act itself. He also publicly apologized.

And you go to VT?

It says “do not touch”

It says do not touch.

Hard agree. Show UT Prosim. They aren’t on this sub probably

If they’re graduating from VT, they should know not to touch the cenotaph. It’s an extremely important memorial at VT and I would be surprised if students didn’t know about it and the rules for not touching it. Disgusting behavior, especially sitting on it. Placing a hand on it is one thing (still not great) but sitting on it and posing for pictures is another kind of disrespect entirely.

Grown ass college kids don’t know what a cenotaph is?

No, because how would most people know? This isn’t exactly something that’s commonly talked about, and most students aren’t frequenting that part of the pylons on a regular basis. I’m graduating this spring, I wouldn’t know the cenotaph even existed had I not taken pylon club pictures there two years ago. All it takes for someone to do something like this is missing one warning inscribed in the stone itself iirc, evidently not very fuckin clearly if this is happening so often. Did you know the raised platform is also considered revered ground that you’re not supposed to touch either? I certainly didn’t, and I bet you didn’t know that either. That’s the problem. I’m baffled that, at an engineering school of all places, people are constantly getting so upset at the strangers who do this but not the poor design of the monument that allows it to happen again and again. To me, the school disrespects the names more than any one person because their shitty design just repeatedly invites people who don’t know any better to come and disrespect it. This is never a problem with the 4/16 memorial, why do you think that is?

I have no idea what this is or have never seen it. Looks like a rock to me

Nah, just happened this past weekend.

it literally happened over the last few days

Exactly. Maybe they didn’t know the word “cenotaph” or the significance, but I’m positive they can read the sign saying “do not touch” or the names inscribed and assume it’s a memorial of some sort

Ngl I doubt those 8 guys really care about someone taking a picture on a chiseled stone.

what do you want people to do with this information? why did you track down her socials?

Some of of the people on there dived on grenades….

It's not, even though maybe it should be. That said, you have reminded me of a story which I will now tell. Some years ago my family was in Washington DC in the middle of summer doing the monument thing. It was crazy hot and we sat down in some shade at the WW2 memorial to give the kids - 3 or 4 at the time - some water and a snack. And by the time I turned back around both were shoeless and wading in the fountain. A park ranger came up to them to tell them to get out and, about half way though his speech about the solumnity of the monument a really old dude in a "WW2 Vet" hat interrupted him and explained that he and his friends didn't spend the winter of '44 being shelled in some god forsaken French thicket so he could tell little kids not to play in a fountain. I don't know who that guy was but I don't think I've ever been prouder of my country. I think about him a lot, especially when people try to press-gang the military into providing some pomp and circumstance for their own political agenda. But yea, people should stay off the cenotaph (or however it's spelled). That said, the signage could be a lot better

In the last century.

As a librarian, I can assure you, people do not read.

Given that I only learned about it last year for my job, its pretty common that students dont know the rules about it even when they are about to graduate. If I didn't have my job, I wouldn't have learned about it either. A lot of tour guides dont talk about it, its not talked about during orientation (since there really isnt any orientations). I'm not arguing that its disrespectful, because it is but rather than shitting on the person for being ignorant and not knowing how to read (I didnt even know the cenotaph had a "do not touch" on it), educate them.

As a grown ass college student that is about to graduate, I did not know what that was called. Furthermore, also as a grown ass college student I didn't know it said "do not touch" on it. And even further more, I only learned about its history after someone told me about it for MY JOB lmao

I've got a masters in English and I have never seen this word until today.

Every single tour group, and freshman orientation group talks about this. If you spent a good amount of time by the library you could overhear a tour group discussing this during the spring or fall tour season. It’s also mentioned at Hokie Camp if you attended that. It’s possible transfer students, graduate students or people who didn’t spend much time near the library wouldn’t have known about this or read the signs, but at least when I attended this was well known and talked about on campus by multiple people and for multiple events- including around Veterans Day.

> This is never a problem with the 4/16 memorial, why do you think that is? People do pose for photos on the top of the wall overlooking the 4/16 memorial though. I don't think that's disrespectful though. It is a design consideration. For starters, the 4/16 memorial blocks are not of a size, shape, or height where a person would ever really WANT to stand/sit on them. They also -- deliberately or not -- look like grave markers. I've overheard plenty of folks wondering if the 32 are buried there (they aren't). But I agree, the signage and the overall design of the cenotaph could be much, much clearer. Of course, that ship has sailed. You can't just rip the damn thing up and start over. It has its own history now. But if VT had it to do over again or somehow found the political will to renovate it, I would suggest incorporating water into the design. By replacing the raised dias its on with a (mostly) still pool of water and allowing a constant stream of water to flow over the stone you would STRONGLY discourage people from getting on top of it. There might be erosion issues and you'd have to heat it a little in the winter, but those seem like solvable problems. Random thought: birds must crap on the thing. Is someone from the Corps of Cadets assigned to clean it off or something?

ignorance is forgivable to a point - shouldn't be this clueless after 4 years. you've known for 2 years - why don't they?

You must not go to Virginia Tech then

u a geologist or sumthin?

Agreed! Go Hokies! Cute pup

This is the kind of critically important community update I'm here for 13/10, goodest boi

10/10. Good boy!!!

Very cute doggo, what is he?

He is an old man so makes sense 😆

The best Sheltie

He doesn’t get it from me that’s for sure

He knows we don’t play until Thursday but, he also knows Saturdays are for college ball 🦃🦃

Thanks! He’s a Sheltie

Somewhere in the U.S. in the 1950s.

Anybody find out where?

“Somewhere”

Total Enrollment in the Fall of 1953 was 3,322 By the Fall of 58, it was up to 5,318

Looks way better now with the major trees

It looks so naked

I wonder if this was the dedication of the War Memorial? My Dad told me they were building it when he was there and he was a freshman (back then they were called Rats) in 1956 so I'd guess this was in the late 50s.

The trees by it were so smol back then

Back when VMI and WVU were a challenge for us in football.

Probably NYC or something

Not a spot of color on campus back then…

Hey you know what this image doesn't need? A giant ugly bridge obscuring the view!

Dang, the trees not grown up make this look crazier

I see no vt parking signs ((:

We need to bring in those people that are really good at that google earth game. They might be able to track it down!

The Pylons at Virginia Tech

Agreed. It looks so naked here.

Crazy to think about how young they are, granted I guess ~60 years would make a decently sized oak

The War Memorial Chapel was dedicated on Sunday, May 29, 1960.

Glad that is history! Right? RIGHT???

I know some folks might not like it but I kind of enjoy the bridge. Not only do I have fond memories of studying and connecting with people inside- It’s also a formal “gateway” to home. The way campus unfolds after going through it is kind of magical.

Torg bridge makes the symbolic "gate" of Tech

>A giant ugly bridge obscuring the view! Building that monstrosity was a crime, so was demolishing the nearly century old University Clubhouse that was designed by Clinton Cowgill to build that huge new dorm across from Barringer.

Good thing there’s no bridge blocking this view!

Not just cadets, also reserves. But yeah

Look at the subreddit you're in.

I don’t know about that it seems like there are some trees missing

I wonder if University Terrace was around then?

Yes the revered University Clubhouse, a place so many students and alumni have been and have very fond memories…. totally not an incredibly low-use building whose antiquated white people’s club has no functional purpose….

No, University Terrace was built in 1987.

>whose antiquated white people’s club has no functional purpose Actually that "antiquated white people's club" had a bunch of apartments on the upper floors most of which were rented to international students many of whom were not white. With a 2500 acre campus VT had plenty of other space to build that dorm. They didn't need to knock down a historic structure to build it.

Stolen meme

Here are some options 1) VT decides to open online - people freak out because most don't want to go all online and others will say that VT is being too conservative in their approach. 2) VT decides to open normally - people freak out because that isn't a choice with good supporting evidences for safety 3) VT waits to see how things work out for a bit - people get angry because they don't know what is happening. There are probably more options, but this just is a shitty situation and without knowing the thought process, many schools are in a similar boat. The HS I teach at has a deadline to release info about opening and is working on 3 separate plans depending on the data when that deadline hits. It sucks and I hate not knowing, but I don't see an obvious choice for them to take. Do you have a good idea for what they should do? #1 seems to be the safest option for students, but also the worst educationally and for the culture of the school, but it might be what is needed for Fall.

Here u was thinking it was another VT Hunt post

Internationals: They gave you guys a plan?

Are you sure most don't want to go all online? I'd rather not pay 3-4k to go to zoom university on campus for 3 months when I could do the same at home without paying for room and board. The only better option would be 100% on campus classes, but that just isn't feasible or safe. Traditional dorms have public bathrooms which sounds like an easy way to spread corona and not ideal for safety. If the current plan is to be mostly online, but force us to come to the campus, how is that any better than just being online from home? For those that say they are unmotivated by being 100% online, that is on you, no offence.

thanks for the info

I am not saying what is best at all. And I am not certain that most don't want all online. The point of my statement is that sarcasm and eye rolling about this situation demonstrates frustration but without empathy. People are undoubtedly trying to make good decisions but it isn't clear what the good decision is. I am in similar discussions with my school. We don't want to go online so we are trying to figure out how to make alternatives work. A lot of teachers felt depressed and frustrated with online teaching this last time around, so there are multiple reasons to work on many possible answers and hope that the data supports one. It ain't looking good though.

Yeah, I was just curious if the popular choice is wanting to return to campus. I also just wanted to give my opinion on it and how it just does not sound feasible, but money is money and colleges love that. Also the last bit definitely was not targeting anyone that was just a general statement, sorry how I worded

No worries dude. Take care!

You too! I do appreciate and agree with what you had to say though, but was just curious about the "most don't want to go all online" part. Also, it would be true that 100% online is the worst educationally, but we must adapt and find a way to motivate ourselves to do the work when it might be, as you said, what is needed for Fall

What the actual fuck

My prof assigned a test the day we got back from this fall break (aka today!!). Guess what I did all weekend: study. Next semester professors will do the same... Edit: I definitely sound like I’m bitching and I over exaggerated a bit, but just wanted to prove a point that an extra day of “break” isn’t ample time for students to recharge as assignments will most likely continue being assigned. Spring break will be missed, but just find ways to remain motivated and spring semester will go fine 👍

Terrible idea. Just replace MWF classes with MW classes all semester (similar to TTH classes). 4-day work weeks, 3 days off. Also (while I wouldn't encourage it), with many classes online nothing is preventing a group of friends from organizing their own travel during the traditional spring break week and logging on to class, beer in hand, from South Beach.

I’m still going to be doing work on those days. Edit: Petition to change it Spring Break back https://www.change.org/p/tim-sands-reinstate-spring-break-at-virginia-tech?recruiter=592241567&recruited_by_id=518891c0-7053-11e6-ad4e-3dfee7e2375b&utm_source=share_petition&utm_medium=copylink&utm_campaign=petition_dashboard

I'm gonna take a wild guess that exactly 0 students were involved in any stage of this decision.

Thomas has never seen such bullshit before

You can literally get the same experience by skipping class or forgetting to log into your Zoom lecture

Spring break would always overwhelm me because it was just straight work. These one day breaks are so much worse than a week long break. Guess what? Teachers won’t give af and have tests right after these “day breaks”. Gl boys.

Fuck this. If I learned anything this semester, it’s that they haven’t taken into account the mental health of students this semester. Even on one day weekends, professors decided to bump up the amount of work/projects due. This won’t reduce stress, it’s going to make it MUCH worse. And it’s already bad.

Interesting because my "Fall Break" was followed up with an exam the next day

Ik why they have to do this but these one day breaks ain’t going to work. Oooh have a Tuesday with no tests but guess what that Wednesday you have an exam have a fun day off. That’s how it’s going to work

"Five one-day breaks" that professors will either ignore completely or utilize to load students up with work, using the reasoning that "you have two days to do it"

This has been the biggest thing pissing me off this semester. My department and apparently the admin just do not care about the students, even if we were to voice concern. Then shit like this goes horribly and they say "oops" or "whatever"

How about we end the semester a week early? Too much to ask?

This whole plan stinks. I don’t even have weekends to myself. I’m drowning in studying. I’m stressed all the time. I’m barely getting enough sleep. I’m absolutely marketable because it’s obvious they haven’t even taken into account our mental health. Whoever planned everything this semester did a terrible job. The least they can do is make it a few long weekends, or at least give NO WORK on a day off, but I guess that’s too much to ask.

No professor is going to respect that.

At least make it 3-day weekends if you're spreading out the off days to discourage travel

This makes me want to ✨die✨

I know that a good lot of professors are going to make work due either the day before or the day after. Same with exams. I’m going to be more stressed because of this, so don’t claim stress relief as the reasoning. Good Lord, what moron suggested this? I get that a lot of people haven’t been following guidelines, but why should the entire university suffer for it? I don’t even do anything for spring break other than spend time with family, yet they found a way to make that nearly impossible.

I'm tired of this bullshit man. I spent my ENTIRE Friday of fall break doing homework that was DUE 11:59 PM on our so called "break". The exact same thing will happen on each and everyone of those day offs next semester. This is not a break at all.

Yeah I was swamped with two projects and a take home exam over this “Fall Break” we had Friday. Something tells me this is going to be the same. Btw... still working on the projects and have had no break. Thanks

That means I still have fucking work at Turners damnit

One of the worst things they have come up with

Bruh one day does nothing. Maybe I don’t have class but Im still gonna have homework and I’ll still have to be thinking and stressing at school. The whole point of a week break is being able to take your mind off school and relax

This is the equivalent of study hall in grade school.

I would have much rather them said it was changed due to concern over covid then try and pass this off as a good idea lol

This is just one dumb move after another. Sands and his crew gotta go

It bothers me that admins treat students as children. If traveling is a bad idea, don't travel. If it's bad enough that official action should be taken, let the appropriate government officials do it. But if students are so childish that they literally can't be trusted with a week to themselves then why are they allowed to own guns, drink, drive, vote, take massive loans, have sex, sign contracts, etc.? Students are making adult choices and taking on real responsibility every day at Virginia Tech. This patronizing from the administration is inappropriate.

I get the logic to reduce travel but seriously?? They shouldn’t have even mentioned stress relief, all this is is a glorified reading day.

So by these rules, professors could have an assignment due at 11:59 that night, realize that it’s during a break day, and just move it one minute past to midnight so it’s technically due the next day. So you’d still have to work on assignments on your “break” day. So it’s not a break. Cool cool, this is garbage.

Tech is making it reallyyyy hard to be happy about being apart of the hokie community...they are quickly driving the pride in this university away...

None of these days are going to be breaks, they will just be days to catch up on work. This is going to drive students into the ground.

This is a slap in the face and just makes me think next semester is gonna be no different

Tim Sand’s crackpipe must be hot to the fucking touch

F in the chat

Graduating in December hehe

These are a Friday, Thursday, Wednesday, Tuesday, Monday in order. We don’t even get 3 day weekends every time.

I think a good compromise would instead be to have a few four-day weekends. That's a much longer break and gives you more time to spread out any work assigned for the end of it.

I get that they don’t want people traveling, but holy fuck what is that

This is hella fucking wack.

There is no breaks in online school

Is this better or worse than completely canceling spring break?

Fuck you give me the week off

Man I’m glad I didn’t have to go to tech during all this.

This is a joke? There is no way this is real right?

Yeah right....like fall break when teachers still gave out homework? No thanks. I'd rather have my 5 consecutive days!

Thanks Timmy Sands :)

Professors will just move their assignments and tests forward or back one day...

Grad students are some of the best people at this university and they are being mocked and derided by the university

Honestly that’s the story of academia. Even into professorship people struggle to survive. STEM fields are “publish or die” and grants makes or breaks you. Many of the faculty here face the same issues but are told that’s just the way it is. It’s wrong and academia as a whole needs reform and to refocus on education and research for it’s own sake rather than money and fame. (I’m a grad student in clincal psych)

How do I help?

Where can a transcript be found to show this quote's accuracy and context?

In my doctoral program at the University of Michigan we had 12 PhD students in our department. 6 had families. 5 of those 6 were on food stamps. It’s sadly a problem everywhere

oh no i sure hope the grad students don't go on strike like they did [at UIC](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2019/05/university-illinois-chicago-graduate-worker-strike) or [at Columbia](https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2022/01/07/columbia-university-strike-ends/)...

All you have to do is have a long term affair with a former president and you’ll be just fine. Look where it got Kim!

I hope this doesn't get lost in the sauce But follow their insta!!!! https://instagram.com/breakingsilencevt?utm_medium=copy_link

Please don't downvote me, but I just feel like I'm missing something here. Are most of y'all getting your degrees paid for and getting around $2,000 a month? Is that the deal that we're complaining about? Because that's the deal I have and I'm worried partially because I thought I'd be able to live pretty comfortably on that, but also I'm genuinely curious if there's something else happening that I'm not aware of. I come from a family where my brother got his master's but only had half of it paid, and he still has over $60,000 in student debt. When I got my full ride and assistantship I was elated, but now I feel weird about it because so many people are saying they're on food stamps and stuff.

The “because I suffered you have to too” fallacy. It’s also really prevalent in the medical residency programs. “I wasn’t allowed to sleep, so neither are you! Also don’t fuck up even though you’re sleep deprived.” Painfully unscientific It’s a shame these mentalities develop, especially when it comes to making ends meet

What an embarrassment to VT. I guarantee the graduate students here work twice as hard at this freeloading bitch

It's well known that graduate students don't make much. This issue happens almost everywhere at universities across the country. Academia is a high stress environment with very little financial benefits unless you're at the top of the field. Unless there's a major change in how graduate students are treated across the country, Tech has no incentive to do anything. Tech can still attract talents to their graduate programs if all the other top graduate programs are doing the same thing.

One of the CS professors said (in the middle of a class) "TAs are like puppies. Sometimes you get a good one and sometimes a bad one". This how they look at us folks. We are dogs to them. That's why they think we only deserve bones. I just wish they love dogs as much as I do but honestly I don't think so.

Do you have an instagram? This will likely gain more traction there.

it’s not entirely the university’s fault. wage stagnation along with inflation make this problem so much worse.

so what's the actual number of grad students who are struggling, what does struggle to make ends meet actually mean, and what method did you use to get here? no offense, but this just comes off as one of my drunken rambles that I just have with myself.

Have things changed so much? I was a grad student for, well, kinda a long time. I was always food secure (is that the right phrasing?) and so were my friends as far as I knew. Is it wildly different outside the ECE department? Honestly, this kinda strikes me as a privileged group (grad students are a privileged elite if you compare to the general population) griping for more, but it's so different from what I saw that I half suspect that I'm just out of touch. Is there some data on this? I want more than anecdotes and bad quotes.

Personal attacks on people you disagree with are disgusting.

You know she does have a point. Virginia tech has been paying the dining services employees that feed them for free without a thanks near starvation wages for years. They have been letting people go hungry for decades while paying their admin more than most of the dining services staff make in a year in 2 months.

So the silence is broken with personal attacks and gossip?

>“publish or die” I always think of [this comic](https://www.smbc-comics.com/comic/2012-01-17) when I hear that phrase.

The University Council has deferred the vote on the Living Wage Resolution for an indefinite amount of time until "language issues" can be resolved, but have signaled they will probably vote it down anyway. When more information is available we'll make another post on the subreddit urging people to attend the vote. You can keep up to date by [following us on social media](https://vtbreakingsilence.carrd.co/) or following [the GPSS on Twitter](https://twitter.com/VTGPSS). We created BreakingSilence@VT to speak out about issues impacting everyone on campus - faculty, staff, and students. Also, apparently the university's top administrative leaders unironically use Twitter to make their decisions. No we're not joking. Several of us and many of the people we work with have said that university administrators (including the Board of Visitors) will frequently quote Tweets in official meetings when talking about student and even faculty/staff opinions. So genuinely the best thing you can do (for now at least) is Tweet at Virginia Tech and Tim Sands in support or retweet what we and others post about shit like this. But especially, please talk to the grad students in your life and let them know they have your support. Part of how we overcome this is by helping and serving those around us. That's the spirit of *Ut Prosim*.

Unfortunately, Kim said this as she walked out of the building to a group of distressed graduates sat outside. While it’s always wonderful to have transcripts or recordings, this isn’t one of those times. As someone who knows a person that was there for Kim’s comment (and it was a large group she said it to) I think it’s telling to hear how Kim speaks to grads when “the cameras aren’t rolling” versus the veneer she puts on when knowing full well she’s being recorded.

In theory it is nice, but the large majority of students can't do without pay and just want to graduate. Striking hurts most grad students more.

Which one? Steger? 🤢

Cost of living in Blacksburg is skyrocketing, and that requires an increasing number of VT graduate students to live paycheck-to-paycheck and without basic necessities. If you're planning to live alone, rent will be half that $2000/mo. Then you need to buy food/groceries, gas, pay bills, healthcare, etc. Do you think you can make do with $1000/mo for ALL of your expenses outside rent?

That's honestly the case in most jobs. The people at the top get paid to make decisions based on the actual work the people under them do. I understand working your way up in a company or a field, you deserve to get paid more for your expertise, but i'll never understand the inability to look at your own hard past and say "Thank god I worked hard because my life was a struggle, let me make someone elses struggle just as hard because I had to".

This is true, but data shows that VT is actually far behind their peers in regard to student pay. A lot of other universities have either waived, or drastically reduced student fees. This means VT both pays less and charges more. When you look at the overall graduate population and intake at VT we are not performing well. So, while I agree with you that low pay is a problem across academia, VT is still performing poorly in a place where the bar is pretty damn low.

I looked it up and [it looks like they do](https://www.instagram.com/breakingsilencevt/).

There's also the [Virginia Tech Food Access and Security Study](https://vtechworks.lib.vt.edu/bitstream/handle/10919/95218/VTFoodAccessSecurityStudyReport20191030.pdf) from 2019, which the university has had years to act on.

[The Graduate and Professional Student Senate (GPSS) conducted a cost of living survey last year](https://gpss.vt.edu/advocacy/2020-2021-advocacy/2021-cost-of-living-survey-results.html) that found that about 1/3 of graduate students experience food insecurity (up to 1/2 for international graduate students). There's also more details in the report linked. This is what informed the resolution and why so many graduate students are so upset.

No offense, but you sound like a boot locker who works to devalue the organizing being done to actually feed the people who produce the most researcher at the university. No offense but you sound like a silver spoon baby taking food from your peers. Do some of your own research before you trash this for no reason. Act like a big kid and do the work your asking for (or fucking pay your friend to look it up 🙄) Again no offense: go back to halo,

What was their gripe with Byron Hughes?

[That post is still up so IDK what you're talking about.](https://www.reddit.com/r/VirginiaTech/comments/t00jea/vt_admin_suppresses_student_speech_and_makes/) Also Byron is an ass, he told a group of sororities at a sexual violence meeting that they should try not to dress/act in ways that attract "unwanted attention" which is super victim-blamey.

I’m not sure how grad students are privileged elite? It’s not a privilege nor an honor to work 60 hour weeks making $1800 a month pre-tax doing highly skilled labor. > griping for more What part of food insecurity reduction and improving quality of life beyond making ends meet is griping for more? You’re out of touch.

I don't want to sound like a dick, but did you enjoy being food insecure? I worked before grad school because I grew up on food assistance and didn't want to do it again. I ended up spending a significant amount of my savings because of the low wages I was paid. Why should people 't have to have a shitty time just because you and I did?

When were you a grad student? Cost of living has increased considerably, especially in regard to housing.

I don’t understand how y’all made it this far yet can’t google. Idk how y’all get through school. If you need more anecdotes to care about some of the schools heaviest lifters, then look it up or pay someone. It’s so annoying, just copy paste the shit you just wrote into google. Touch grass and talk to grad students 🙄

A living wage for other VT employees is also a campaign in the works.

I didn't know "quoting someone" was a personal attack, but that probably says more about how shitty her comments were than it does about the person quoting her.

You don't see a problem with a third of graduate students suffering from food insecurity at a multimillion dollar university? Tuition reimbursement is great, but it doesn't pay for food and rent. Also, 2k a month is a very high-ball estimate. We make closer to 1650 a month after deductions. On top of this, the deal is especially difficult for international students who often aren't permitted to work elsewhere by their visa, so don't have alternative sources of income. They can't work anywhere over the summer in the US when they aren't working as a TA.

The issue is that grad students can't afford food, rent, and medical care. Tuition remission does not pay for any of those. Grad students need to be paid more to afford basic needs because wages have been stagnant as the cost of living, the cost of education, and inflation have risen. That is the problem.

A cost of living survey was conducted in the past and found that that average GA salary is not sufficient. I also think it’s worth noting that many students would not have the funds to attend graduate school without tuition remission. You’re not really saving money when you didn’t have that money in the first place.

How to say u don't have a life without saying you don't have a life

I love SMBC but that's way off. Publishing is not suppsoed to be your sole duty. The idea was that a prof should teach, and mentor / advise older (grad) students, and do some research, and do some extension work, and publish the results of all of this. Publish or perish means that all that other shit is totally irrelevant, the only thing that matters is pumping out pubs (even if they're mediocre pubs). This leads to a lot of bad behavior. P-hack if you must, salami slice your work, ~~steal~~ borrow other people's ideas from conferences if you can beat them to publication. Bully your way onto the papers of lesser faculty members, include your friends as authors as long as they return the favor... none of this will hurt you as long as you get pubs. It doesn't even matter if the paper actually contributes anything to the world, it just matters that it's on your resume. And lol at teaching, if you suck at teaching, nobody cares. Shit, if you're abusive or even sexually harass students, most universities will sweep that under the rug if you're bringing money and pushing out pubs. On the other hand if you're fantastic at teaching and a great adviser, and contribute to the state, but don't have as many pubs, fuck you. I'd argue that someone who is great at the "publish or perish" game is probably a pretty bad professor, but not according to the tenure and promotion committee.

Found and scanned some pictures from my mom's graduation in 82. Thought this sub would appreciate.

Looks so peaceful! Thanks for sharing

TIL: all those lamp posts used to be painted grey not brown

I would love to see an overly of then and now because I don’t recognize half of those places

It may not be recognizable anymore, but aside from the construction around Litton Reaves this exactly how I remember campus circa 2000.

Ah yes back when tuition was $3.50

Love the pic from the residential side. Shows how cluttered it is now.

Woah! My dad graduated in '82. He always said campus looked almost unrecognizable, so I'm glad to have a look at what he saw. Thanks for sharing!

This is so cool. Thanks for sharing! It’s weird to see Lane shaped like that. I have no doubt that football games were still a blast, but I wonder how different the atmosphere was given that it was probably significantly quieter with all that sound escaping out the sides

These are awesome, thank you for sharing!

Thanks for sharing even though I don’t have any plans on graduating college this was cool to see

I was hoping to see a pic of your mom with that 80's big hair :D Cool pics!

It’s so cool to see how things used to look

Awesome! Love this stuff, thanks for sharing

Peaceful's a good word for it!!

*innovation that excites*

Some of them don’t actually exist anymore. At least the second one with the sign/map is long gone. It was taken on the old Southgate where you used to come in off of 460. Not sure when you were at tech/if you’re there now, so you might already know, but for those who don’t, the exit off of 460 was only built in 2018. Southgate used to keep going straight through the duckpond drive traffic circle and eventually ended at a stoplight where you could get on and off of 460. In that picture, you’re looking as if you’re coming on to campus off to the right side of the road, and the old dairy barns (now displaced by the airport expansion and the new Southgate Dr) are in the background. Probably a really confusing explanation but if you look at google maps you can see what I mean. And if you get on 460 west off of Southgate Dr, and keep an eye out to your right, you can see where the intersection used to be (there’s a gate and a big clearing).

Also, I forgot because it was WELL before my time, this would’ve been even before the 460 bypass was even built. It wasn’t until VT Football really got rolling that they built the highway (imagine all the football traffic coming in to town from South Main St. Yikes.) not sure where Southgate ended up back then. I’d have to do some digging.

Might do this for a few next time I'm on campus

Same, this looks way more like what I knew in the early 2000's than what it looks like now.

We made Lane loud, then we added structures to keep it loud, e.g. the South End Zone stands. The conventional bleachers that existed in front of the SEZ scoreboard were torn down and a new bleacher section established on the North, along with a shiny new scoreboard complete with fancy shiny new Jumbotron. Then they built the imposing tower that is the South End Zone. Then the expanded the press box end-to end. I got to be there for all of it, enrolling shortly after the 2-8-1 season, and finally leaving after the 11-0 "Perfect Season" It was wild seeing a veritable unknown* and "quiet" school become a Football School. As a freshman lots of students were wearing the gear of other schools (I distinctly remember seeing a fair bit of UNC and Tennessee hats/sweat shirts etc). By the time I graduated, wearing anything other than the Maroon and Umber was unthinkable. *unknown in terms of College Football

Lane was the weirdest part for me too, especially seeing "Fighting Gobblers" on it!

Haha! She definitely had the hair, she probably wouldn’t appreciate me putting those pics on Reddit though 😆

Yes, Southgate when it was a useful road. The interchange was sorely needed and the diverging diamond works well (except for the awful off ramp from 460 eastbound, with the too-tight curve onto the overpass). Old Southgate was a straight-arrow road from Beamer Way to the bypass, with a 45 MPH speed limit once past Duck Pond Dr. The new road, apparently for traffic calming, dips and curves and has a (rarely followed) 25 MPH speed limit and two roundabouts. Not sure how it works for football traffic but at times it is quicker to go to the S. Main exit on 460 and double back to get to places on S. Main instead of using what used to be a reasonable shortcut on Southgate.

Yeah just spent like 10 minutes on Google maps checking it out! You can see where south gate drive would have continued straight, eventually perpendicular to 460. Pretty sweet!

And, to go back just a few more years, the stoplight was not at the intersection of Southgate and 460 when I moved to Blacksburg. I don't know the exact year, but it was probably put up around 1990. Yep, there as a stop sign there, and that went as well as you might expect, especially when everyone was leaving campus after 5 PM. Also, West Campus Drive used to run behind Engel Hall, not between Engel and Hillcrest. I remember seeing some maps and aerial photos from the early 1950s (I think they were in the geology library—does that even exist any more?) showing West Campus running through the area where Cheatham Hall is.

Southgate took you to 460. 460 was a 4 lane road with stop lights until the turn after what is now Sheetz. It was what is now 460 Business. We never came in via South Main, always 460 to Southgate. The by pass was built to help with traffic. It was here at least 10 years before the new Southgate interchange. They also wanted to improve the entrance to campus. The old entrance with the cow barns was a real turnoff and hurt with recruiting. The final blow (I think) was when we hiatus the ncaa baseball regional and all you could smell was the cow barns the whole weekend. That weekend was perfect, well organized, beautiful weather, etc. But the cow manure was strong. (And we lost in the final and lost our coach too.)

The section around Blacksburg was around since the '70s.

Wow, thanks so much. It’s really cool to be able to hear from someone who watched us transform into a football school in real time. I can’t even imagine what it was like to be a Hokie at our football team’s peak. It kind of makes me nostalgic for something that I wasn’t even alive to experience

Oh whoa, good catch! I didn’t even notice that

I'm pretty sure the speed limit on the old Southgate Dr between Duck Pond Dr to the bypass was 35 mph (at least as far back as the early '90s). I seem to remember that S. Main was posted at 45 mph in the '90s, but was reduced to 35 mph at some point.

See [https://history.unirel.vt.edu/physical\_plant/campus\_streets.html](https://history.unirel.vt.edu/physical_plant/campus_streets.html) about campus streets and [https://history.unirel.vt.edu/physical\_plant/1948\_comparison.html](https://history.unirel.vt.edu/physical_plant/1948_comparison.html) for a map comparing 1948 to the present.

Ahh I figured there must’ve been some sort of connection to 460 (like every other road in Blacksburg) Thanks for the info! I must’ve gotten a bad explanation from someone along the line.

>The by pass was built to help with traffic. It was here at least 10 years before the new Southgate interchange. > >They also wanted to improve the entrance to campus. The old entrance with the cow barns was a real turnoff and hurt with recruiting. The bypass was built in the late '60s/early '70s as part of a statewide program to improve highways. Many towns had bypasses (the Christiansburg Bypass was an early one, while it wasn't until the late '70s that 460 was four-laned through Giles County). There were at-grade intersections with Southgate (which was extended from Duck Pond Drive at the time), Prices Fork Road (with stop signs at first), and Toms Creek Road (although interchanges were planned for each intersection). Eventually a traffic light was added to Prices Fork Rd. in the mid-70s as the town (mainly Hethwood) expanded across the bypass. The interchange replaced the traffic lights in the late '70s. Toms Creek was next, pushed for after a popular Blacksburg High School student was killed in a traffic accident there. Southgate was last, held up by the town and the CRC. The town wasn't keen on the location of "new" Southgate from Tech Center Dr. to Hubbard St., planned to bypass Airport Rd. and those neighborhoods. The CRC folks wanted their own interchange directly into the office park. The eastern changes to Southgate were eventually killed off, the interchange location was a compromise between using the current Southgate location and a CRC interchange -- facilitated by the FAA demanding increased clear zones at the ends of the runway (which was to be extended anyway), which did in the dairy farm complex (solving the problem of "cow smells").

The speed limit may have been dropped on Southgate. South Main was 40 or 45, but the town lowered it -- as it has done all over town. The Town of Blacksburg has an aversion to allowing vehicle traffic to flow. It lowered the speed limit on four-lane Patrick Henry from 35 to 25 MPH (mainly due to stupid students who walked out into traffic) and has artificially low limits in other parts of town. The traffic lights on Prices Fork from Plantation Rd. west to Bruin Lane are all tied together as a sync'ed system, but when it works it works against traffic. If you get a red light at Plantation, you will probably get red lights all the way to the town limits (supposedly to collect traffic into blocks to better utilize road capacity). The lights on S. Main from Ellett Rd. to at least Airport Road are supposed to be synchronized, but rarely work that way since side-street traffic gets priority at the lights.

New VT Covid-19 protocols

Bring back surprise shower mask inspections

nice work freshman

It needs a fake signature to make it look more official.

I wonder if the QR code takes you anywhere cheeky.

And the QR code nice work bro lmao

I call first dibs

I'd recognize the qr code anywhere

Lmao my roommate made that one. We still laugh about when it’s brought up

It's fake bruh

It would be funny if it was a rick roll

Good detective work sherlock

That mini-game on the housing website 404 page was really fun!

It could be a lot better...

Fuck I don't know dude I've never even seen a dorm building before I don't know if they actually put signs up like that

Do you really think a university would make masturbation designated stall. Of course it’s fake. Come on man, use your head

KING_COVID got into Virginia Tech. Un-fucking-believable.

I mean I really don't see why not

Dude ya gotta realize it’s fake as fuck

I don’t think he’d fit in one lol

VT Dining Y’all

You can’t do JP’s like that...

PUT SOME RESPECT ON MY BOY BLUE RIDGE

the disrespect when fighting gobbler easily has the best fries on campus

I do not respect your opinion

What's the beef with Blue ridge and chophouse?? They smackk

JP's is better than Fire Grill Change My Mind

How dare you disrespect deets like that

This is all wrong.

Origami do be hittin tho

I must be the only one who’s favorite is Seven70 :-(

where's ABP ):

It’s been so long and I’m afraid to ask, where do I get this chicken parm?

Sorry, A small price to pay for salvation

Nobody knows it exists

Nah it’s better. I had Fire Grill one time and it was trash

With Yum Yum sauce ofcrs

I liked it until they stopped selling hot sandwiches

Ppl steal my food at Seven70

...what’s that?

It’s everywhere on campus

Abp is life. Imma be living on it for the next week lmao

Owens on Wednesdays

Salivation*

that’s part of why it’s so great. never has a line

Yes sir! You gotta scheme 6 pumps instead of 3

They still sell hot sandwiches. Sometimes they don’t have enough people tho.

They started checking ppls hokie p’s to prevent it

I feel your pain

A deli type place in the West End market. Wraps, sandwiches, etc

Y u still on campus bruh

Who actually serves it

Where is it

Never have been able to buy one this whole school year and I’m a senior. Bad way to go.

Do they still have the Hokie Club?

Planes are expensive m8

Right next to CFA... hence why noone knows

I’ve basically only ever gotten the chicken bacon wrap, so im not sure

yes they do

Parking services be like

[Town Hall](https://youtu.be/9IeMFfzFl0U) today at 1. It's focused on graduate education, but parking is relevant to everyone. Raise your concerns. Edit: Never mind, the whole thing is another canned script.

Let's contact the Collegiate Times :) &#x200B; "Tech buttfucks students in the middle of a pandemic, encourages thousands of students to ride public transport"

What happened that they got worse? I'm out of the loop here

Parking-related questions were definitely submitted. . .and summarily ignored.

Sad things haven't changed. Get used to that in the real world too. Also expect the only time those in charge have for questions --- goto basically the butt lickers or butt fucking idiots.

Basically, they're enforcing parking regulations up till 10 pm 7 days a week. Previously, they only enforced them up till 5 pm other than around the Drillfield or a few 24 hour enforcement lots.

They clarified it’s only weekdays.

That's because they think if they "oops" the weekend back as "free parking" people will just give up and slink away

Massive plank fell from ceiling in McBryde 100 and destroyed someone's laptop

Damn, just a few inches from free tuition

If anyone knows the student whose laptop got damages please follow up. I would love to hear how that reimbursement process goes

Has anyone else had anything like this happen in a VT classroom?

I’m glad everyone is okay! I thought the planking trend ended back around 2013. This is ridiculous

Now campus is literally falling apart, very cool.

Glad it didn't puncture the battery, then everyone in the room could add lithium poisoning to the long list of shitty things that happened to them in mcbryde

A piece of drop ceiling fell on someone in bishop favrou last semester, they were unharmed tho

Time to close McBryde and all the walkways around it, rerouting everything through the Norris tunnel as the only way to get to Turner’s All in the name of reasonable renovations

Pressure the university to replace the laptop

What does the ceiling of that room look like? I can't remember.

Good luck getting reimbursed for the value of a new laptop

Hopefully the student can still recover any files from the computer or it's all back up in the cloud.

Wish it would’ve destroyed me😵‍💫

Now this is the content I come here for…

Bruh just a month too early, literally sat there for intro to astronomy

I have class here in an hour wtf

They will replace the the laptop but without any physical injury no lawsuit will work. I'd like to see a photo of the ceiling where it was but I suppose that wasn't important.

Hope it wasn't a Building Construction class

Omg I was in that class, to the girl who’s laptop broke, I’ll be your whiteness, I’m sorry your laptop is fucked.

They renovated this room recently too...

Up the fees

Guy must have been board

Anyone know the potential damage if that plank managed to hit someone?

Whys this sub so lawsuit-happy? I’m confident the laptop will be quickly taken care of. Glad she’s okay. Y’all sound pretty amped up.

r/catastrophicfailure

Friend of mine got plowed by a university bus on campus and didn't get free tuition/ He had to sue for medical bills. It was the busses fault. &#x200B; So don't get hit people!

Whoever it is, I’d recommend talking to a lawyer to see how much they think they can help you. This is a blessing.

2 years ago in Saunders, the air conditioning broke (this was early Fall semester, it was 80+ degrees in the room), and a ceiling tile got soaked with water and almost fell on someone’s head. The next class period the tile was gone and there was a hole in the ceiling for the rest of the semester

Back in 91 my chem class in Davidson got to experience the professor doing the "challenger" demonstration. Filling a balloon with Hydrogen gas and then putting a match on a stick to it. But, the professor didn't use a small balloon, it was easily 2 feet across. Ka-fng-boom! Dust went off of every single surface in the building, and set off car alarms outside. My ears were ringing for about a week.

Yeah I actually had this exact thing happen…I was in McBryde room 100 when it happened lol. Nearly killed one of the girls that came in with the guest speaker this morning

Had a window break last semester. Minor injury but treatment was declined.

I’ve been in there a lot and I don’t ever recall looking up in there lol

"[wood ceiling clouds](https://www.mbcontractors.com/project/mcbryde-hall-virginia-tech/)" apparently

Nor do I, but I would have guessed acoustic ceiling tile. That looks like a 2x10 walkboard, not some kind of finish material. If there's an interstitial space above the ceiling tiles it could be a temporary board that was left after construction/remodel that eventually worked its way to the edge of what ever was supporting it and then fell through the ceiling.

Depends on when you went, they remodeled in 2016-ish

It’s not made out of planks…it’s basically like traditional auditorium ceiling.

Highly unlikely the data is lost

I don't know you but I'm glad it didn't destroy you. Please reach out if you need help finding support.

Ik you meant witness but lmao “whiteness” 😂

The plank weights about 40/50 lbs (depending on the finish), getting hit by the side probably would feel like getting run over by an electric bike, getting hit by one of the corners most likely would make your heart rate be 0.

Because universities want to squeeze every last cent from us and don’t want to give anything back

As a state entity, the university can just claim sovereign immunity which prevents a lawsuit. You have to have permission from the state to sue the state.

I wouldn’t bother with a lawyer unless VT tried to fuck em out of reimbursement and it will be much easier for them to just pay it off so I highly doubt they will.

PSA: Fellow CS majors, please please please take a shower This is the only way I can think of expressing this ongoing issue. The horrid stench in my CS classes has genuinely impacted my ability to focus and learn. I wear two masks to class not because of COVID, but to help cover the absolutely disgusting smell of other students. I’m hoping the mask mandate stays, bc I legit may just pass out if I were to come to class without one on. As a CS major who actually takes showers and wears deodorant, I seriously don’t understand how some of you can go weeks without a shower. It baffles me. I’ve been dealing with it for a while, but it’s gone too far. Taking a daily shower costs five minutes of ur time. Get up off ur PC set up and turn it on. Do it. Please. Desperately asking.

Just wait. I told super smash bros club and the entirety of the CPE major that there was free pizza in the lounge.

can confirm op is spot on with this… as somebody with basic hygiene that also happens to be a CS major, some of these kids absolutely disgust me

I haven’t laughed this hard in a long time. Thank u.

i refuse to believe that people don’t shower but i guess anything is possible

It’s not even just the lack of showering. DO YOUR LAUNDRY PEOPLE. WASH YOUR JACKETS. AND YOUR SHIRTS. AND EVERYTHING ELSE DAMN. If they still smell after washing …. you need to throw them away.

This one bout to go viral on discord

You know, I thought it was a joke that CS majors dont shower. But dang

Glad(?) to hear the CS lounge stank hasn't gone anywhere in the past 8 years.

This is fucking hilarious and I’d imagine, due to being remote for a year, the self care declined even further. Who has time to clean when you can do CS and game in your off time?

I used to think that this was a joke until I read the comments. If this is actually true, you CS people are disgusting. I can’t believe I’m actually going to have to do in person lectures with you people.

It's not surprising in general. This is why the military actually gives lessons on how to clean yourself.

Yall not all CS majors are like this. Please don't lump me in with them 😭

Bold of you to assume that engineers shower

Neck beards gunna neck beard

This was an issue when I was there. Not sure why it’s a CS issue. I can only guess it’s addicted gamers who put personal hygiene at the bottom of their daily to do list. You’d think they’d start to smell themselves and get annoyed enough to shower and brush eventually. Also no a 5 minute shower isn’t a decent shower imo. 10-15 min if you need to shampoo and condition the hair. That’s not required every day though. The lounge furniture will probably have to be replaced and the rugs steam cleaned every so often as it absorbs the odor….that stuff lingers and will continue to stink. I remember the lounge sometimes smelled like old shoes, dirty laundry and BO.

Stereotypes exist for a reason...

Redefining the definition of CS gas. Maybe Tech will require the Cadets to entire the chamber with a few CS students instead.

Someone told me it’s the diet of some individuals that okay a big role. Either way, the stereotypes live on.

Partly why I just don't show up to the lectures. Many of the professors just answer questions during lecture and actually teach entirely through Canvas anyway.

I really never had this problem. I was in CS, I was on and then coached the ACM programming team for years. Of course I barely attended any of the early year lectures. My theory is that the ones who are actually any good are smart enough to be functional humans.

Nothing makes ya sweat like forgetting to put on deodorant

As a senior CS major, I have never experienced this in any one of my classes. I talked to 4 other CS friends about this post and they all agreed that it's completely overblown. In my time here, I can think of at most a handful of people who looked greasy or unhygienic, but even then none of them smelled. I'm sure you will find people like this in every major

Fresh copypasta just dropped

Well, congrats on singling yourself out.

Hell every other day or every three days is probably fine. 8 shower daily because I like the way I feel after a shower, but many people can get away without stinking on a lower schedule.

I’m thinking about just bringing a couple cans of deodorant and leaving it by the door. Required to put it on before entering class

Idk how someone is comfortable enough to go outside without taking a shower. Like damn… makes me feel itchy.

Lol wasn’t even trying to be funny which is the sad part.

Please meet with STEM majors, you will change your mind

I mean once you walk through Pritchard after that first month in September you'll believe anything is possible.

If your washing machine has a pre-wash cycle, use distilled white vinegar during the pre-wash. Does wonders to get rid of smells. It's especially useful on these synthetic moisture wicking fabrics which tend to trap smell over time. Even if your washer doesn't have a pre-wash cycle option, you can still throw in some vinegar while the water is filling.

That’s nasty if they haven’t replaced the furniture all decade. Those couches trap odor

The furniture in the sociology lounge in Mcbride is older than easily 90% of the student body.

I ended up doing my cs stuff in the library or somewhere else most of the time for this reason (that and I prefer some natural light). That place always smelled pretty bad.

They do? I’m sure especially on ships or subs where showers have to be very short.

CS is on a whole different level, trust

As someone who was once on a week long canoe trip, you don’t notice the smell

Cadets have to do the tear gas chamber?

i’m civil engineering and everyone i’ve seen practiced hygiene

I was CpE and never experienced this problem. This is probably specifically a CS thing. The CS people I dealt with were weird, even by nerd standards, though thankfully never smelt weird.

So far in my engineering classes there’s only been 1 or 2 and that was when it was like 95 outside so ima give them a break

Nah. Us pre meds shower

MechE checking in. All showered and deodorant-ed.

Math grad, only ever met one stinker

oxyclean, too.

Just be careful with bleach unless it’s white socks and cheap white gym shirts.

RIP Nikki Giovanni Damn. https://www.wdbj7.com/2024/12/10/well-known-virginia-tech-professor-dies-81/

“We are Virginia Tech” will always be part of our university

Oh no, that's awful. She was an amazing person. The world, and especially Blacksburg, is a better place because of her.

Ohhh 😔 I had the pleasure of attending a class where she was a guest speaker, shortly after 4/16. She had such a powerful and graceful presence about her. RIP.

She was one of the most interesting people I've ever met: lively and funny, always direct and honest. VT was lucky to have her for so long.

"My heart sank when I saw this. She was such an incredible person. Rest in peace. 💔"

Let's build What we become When we dream

RIP I know you will be very missed in the VA Tech family. Didn't never meet you but you was a awesome contributor to the school.

She singlehandedly brought together a community in mourning. No one else was able to do that. A friend posted elsewhere that while she was so numb and doesn't remember a lot about that day, including the speakers, but Nikki Giovani's speech was the ONE thing she remembered. It was so powerful!

That is 100% true. I was in Cassell that day and every other speech is totally forgotten for me. But her speech, and the way the crowd came together afterward, is a core memory.

Putin in shambles rn

Wow. Support is epic

My colorblind ass thought this was UVA colors for a second and I was really confused. lol

This is dope

Zelenskyy>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>Sands

Let’s go Ukraine!

Why are people getting upset over this?

SLAVA UKRAINI

For anyone interested in supporting Ukraine, you can donate to a few different organizations helping the cause [here](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/02/27/how-to-help-ukraine/) Fuck Putin!

Epic but the right side needs to be yellow…not orange, unless I’m color blind.

Wait tech never has opinions

What a bunch of empty, pointless virtue signaling

Damn I bet Putin just shet his pents

Putin is trembling at western civilians’ virtue signaling.

If only they weren’t West Virginia colors

Their picture on IG looked more yellow than this one does tbh

You mean virtue signaling like what Putin does when he shills for the CCP, Xi Jinping, and the Belt & Road Initiative? I heard Putin bows to his glorious Red puppet-master, Winnie the Pooh, in Beijing no less than 5 times a day. Putin is a perfect puppet for Beijing; he even waited to invade Ukraine until 4 days after the Beijing Olympics were over.

No, he's trembling at Western nations' economic sanctions. Sanctions driven by popular opinion

Tragic: someone you hate makes a good point

You mean like the virtue signaling, like what Putin does when he shills for the CCP and Xi Jinping? His Red puppet masters in Beijing sure know how to make him dance; it’s just like the alliance between Hitler and Stalin, carving up zones of influence. It was Hong Kong yesterday, it is Ukraine today, and it will be Taiwan tomorrow.

At least Zelensky isn’t a CCP shill and puppet who sold out his country to Beijing, like Putin. He actually had enough backbone to stand up to Red China and the CCP’s human rights violations, instead of selling out to Red financiers, exemplified by Ukraine blocking their rail shipments.

Yeah, I’m not a fan of Putin either

He never stood a chance against y’alls instagram stories and bio updates.

It is Ukraine today and it will be Taiwan tomorrow. I guess us proudly showing our support for our close allies in Taiwan by lighting up Burusss Hall in the colors of the ROC flag will also be “meaningless virtue signaling”? Or when people around the world protested against China’s treatment of the Hong Kong protestors, and donated millions to pro-democracy causes, they were just doing acts of “meaningless virtue signaling”?

There’s a lot to say about the effects of public opinion and pressure. Sure, a Reddit post isn’t physically accomplishing anything but it’s spreading awareness and general sense of togetherness in being united against Russia. Look at what is actually happening on the ground in Ukraine. They’re outgunned and outmanned but putting up a hell of a fight because they have spirit. They’re using posts, signs, camaraderie and every other thing they can to unite their people. And it’s working. Laugh all you want but morale can be just as important as military efficiency. Public pressure and community sentiment goes along way

Never said that protesting was meaningless virtue signaling, I said that shining some lights on the side of a building was

"They're outgunned and outmanned" Sure if you think having more untrained plumbers and kindergarten teachers armed with 60 year old rifles and 50 year old tanks, and IFVs can stand up to a professional volunteer army armed with the EUs latest and greatest.

It’s a small act but it means a lot to the Ukrainian students here. There are a number of Poles and other Slavs living in the area, undoubtedly a number of them having Ukrainian ancestry and others being Ukrainians studying abroad. (I have had a number of professors and students from Eastern Europe; some of them Russian, Finnish, Bulgarian, Romanian, Yiddish, Serb, Balt, etc.). They may have family which are under danger. Flags are sacred to people; after all it represents their homeland and their pride. To Ukrainians their flag represents their freedom; it a symbol of their independence, their final victory and freedom over 75 years of Soviet oppression.

Why don't you kids try to raise money and organize instead of relying on the corrupt school administration to simply turn on some pretty lights that do nothing for the people fighting oppression over seas.

Please only drink hard liquor in the library. Some of us are here to party.

Is anyone down to start an unofficial whiskey tasting club that meets in the library once a week?

Study BORG it is then......

Ugh I can’t believe I can’t have my Twisted Twea in the library….guess it’s Jack n Coke then

Good thing I stopped drinking Homework Beers™ before coming to Tech, then.

Lol I remember this, it was hilarious

What’s the origin of this sign? Clearly it’s satire, but who spent their time making this?

Is mead allowed?

I used to get drunk at the math emporium.

Was this a prank?

Love my Hokies

That's freakin hilarious.

What’s a twea?!

This has frat pledge mischief written all over it

Sorry, the sign is my fault. I’ll hide it better next time guys

lol. Always helps the study process

Yeah encourage these kids to act more like fools…. 😩

I know how I got here, but I do not go there. But I’ll be some clear!

let’s do it

During covid, these templates and many more were freely available to anyone with a web browser.

Me n my bro back in 2023 saw this sign asking you to wipe down your table so we copied it with a twist 🤣

No, VT employees are very serious about a spirits only policy

Twisted Tea - hard iced tea

No this is just two procrastinating engineers 😂 (we made the sign)

This was made in google presentations we just copied the design off a real sign trying to replicate the fonts as close as possible.

What was the twist 😭😭

Well that’s unfortunate, i really perform much better on the beer than i do on tequila. Do you think they would check if my tequila bottle was filled with beer?

Lol you worked too hard then. There were templates all over the ready.vt.edu site.

it would have to be a resposado or anejo bottle and a matching color beer like corona or modelo

There’s definitely more than 503 people on campus that are sick.

Yeah they gonna try and force us to stay. Rip East Eggleston.

This doesn't show anyone that tested anyplace other than Schiffert. Schiffert didn't test over the 3-day weekend. Anyone else see any problems with this?!? ETA. Schiffert did have testing over the weekend, my bad. Still doesn't count cases who go elsewhere for testing.

"disappointed but not surprised" has become my new resting state. Anyone else?

Oh so we've done away with the 7 day rolling average positivity percentage rate now? What a great update to the dashboard to conveniently hide that fact.... For the record, as I post this it's 18.25%

I’ve heard that schiffert is making it next to impossible to get tested because you have to prove exposure which isn’t easy to do. A friend of mine who is a suite mate with someone who tested positive was told not to get tested and to self isolate which is suspicious as it sounds like VT is suppressing the numbers. Can anyone else confirm?

With the percent of the positive tests and how transparent VT has been with the dashboard, Virginia Tech is gonna need a second Big Event every year to repair all the damage they have done with the town-gown relationship!

As an alum, it is killing me seeing a place I hold so dearly in my heart being run into the fucking ground by the POS Sands and his shitbag administration. Literally all of them should be out of jobs for the rest of their lives. The level of incompetence they have shown since taking over is absolutely disgusting. I am so sorry for students and faculty going through this shitshow.

Roanoke street and Harding were loaded with dozens of students day drinking yesterday. Cops turned a blind eye. What a fucking joke.

Can someone please link the dashboard to me? Not a student anymore so I don't really know where this is.

I thought all the Covid posts were supposed to be in their own thread above bc normal human beings aren’t obsessing and arguing over where there are 157 or 158 cases

Definitely suspicious, I expect tomorrows numbers to be huge. I got tested Friday and I still haven’t gotten my result, so they’re probably just sorting through the backlog from the long weekend.

Yeah. A lot of people ik with cars would drive elsewhere to get faster results, which I bet is what a lot of upperclassmen are doing. Not tech, but I heard some jmu kids were driving all the way to Warrenton to get tested. so who knows the true numbers for us if everyone is doing something similar

There was a walk in clinic yesterday from 8-11:30

Schiffert also had walk in on Saturday.

If you look at the vdh for Blacksburg though for yesterday for instance. There were 706 cases since March. About 200 before students came back. There were 416 cases reported by tech on Friday. From today 89 more. Which if we assume starting at 200 would be a total of 705 for Blacksburg. Now it was a little less than 200 but not drastically. So there aren’t many results NOT being reported to VT.

>Still doesn't count cases who go elsewhere for testing. Which makes no sense for students to do, and if their urgency also results in forgetting to self-report back to VT then that's even worse.

They never asked me when I went.

I went to get a test cause of exposure, they said I don’t need one because my timeline indicated that the person was likely not contagious. I insisted and demanded a test and then they put me in isolation before even getting results back.

apparently vt pd told all fraternity presidents for their members not to get tested at shiffert in order to keep kids on campus so i’m not surprised

Posted - 503.

Close to 1000.

Between 700 -720.

https://ready.vt.edu/dashboard.html

https://ready.vt.edu/dashboard.html

And that literally makes no sense for them to do (VT kids that is). You can't wait the 5 days from potential exposure date to get a test? The waiting period is literally so that the test result has maximum chance for accuracy.

Those results won't show up for 2-3 days at least.

So far, maybe. They only get counted on VDH if the residence they provide when tested is in the Blacksburg zip code, not say, where their parents live, for example. Most students are probably getting testing at Schiffert, but that doesn't mean we aren't undercounting some in both places.

There were definitely reports of students not being able to get through to Schiffert to make an appointment to get tested last week (busy signal), so they went somewhere else. Schiffert had also told students with known exposure to take the bus because there isn't parking. The responsible thing to do is not take the bus and drive somewhere else (or just stay home and self-isolate without getting tested). Either way, if they go somewhere else or don't get tested, they don't get counted on the dashboard which says specifically "Testing Conducted by Schiffert Health Center" so self reporting to VT doesn't get counted either way there. And just because it doesn't make sense, doesn't mean it isn't happening.

there was definitely some cost-benefit analysis done. feeling real expendable right now...

tbh I would be surprised if the total case is around 650 since we have already reached 416 last week.

I went an hour away because missing 2 days of work was better than missing 5/6 days of work if I tested negative.

I don’t mean waiting to get tested. I mean waiting days to receive your results after you have been tested

You hit on the most responsible thing to do - stay home and self-isolate until you can get a test. To think that it's come to someone not being able to deal with a busy signal and instead hopping into the car to get a test that very likely won't be as accurate as it should be because they won't wait the CDC prescribed 5 days. The arguments those kids were/are making for why they tested elsewhere are swiss cheese-like.

Are you a student? If not, then your situation does not pertain to my position re: it being counterproductive for students in specific to be tested outside of Schiffert's protocol/system. Let's save the potential for your test to not have been accurate due to your impatience for another day.

I don't recall seeing reports of private labs turning around results faster than Fralin. Matter of fact, I've read the opposite. I recall several of the posts boiling down to essentially this: "I think I might have been exposed so I want a test right now".

The busy signal doesn’t signify schiffert trying to tell you to wait the recommended 5 days. The busy signal signifies a failure in the health center to be able to book appointments or even contact individuals and tell them to wait the 5 days. That’s why people are turning to other places to get tested

It's still happening. Also, we are talking about college/university students. Not kids. You are assuming they aren't waiting the CDC prescribed 5 days. No one said that's what is happening when they want to get a test and can't at Schiffert. Without a test, contact tracing doesn't happen beyond what the person does on their own.

I am a student. Edit: another day would have been another $100 I'd be losing. I really couldn't afford to miss more than I had to. Trust me, if I didn't have to worry about paying rent, I would have went the easier route.

Fralin what? Also I’m going based on conversations I’ve had with actual people, not just reddit posts. You’re totally missing the point. It’s not waiting a certain time until you get tested, it’s waiting unnecessarily long to receive the results of the test, leaving you in limbo for multiple days not knowing whether you are positive or negative after testing.

And to be clear, I hope all students go to Schiffert to get tested so they can be reported on the VT dashboard. The easier and safer Schiffert can do this, the better.

None of the posts I read indicated that they were waiting the prescribed 5 days. What I read was people being disappointed that they got a busy signal, being concerned, and going to get a test elsewhere anyway (with a sprinkling of "I was told I have to wait 5 days - screw it I'm driving to Roanoke to get a test). You're right about contact tracing, and students doing their own thing due to impatience or the belief that getting results sooner means they are in the clear totally screws the proverbial pooch.

Then from my point of view you are clearly an exception and it makes total sense why you handled it the way that you did. Unfortunately there are others who are not.

FOOD FOR BPD AND VTPD HAS BEEN DELIVERED!!!

Thank you guys so much for showing your support to the officers and staff who helped keep us safe!

this makes my heart so happy i am so happy i was able to help and contribute! hopefully we can do something for the ems tomorrow!!

They put in so much work last night. This is well deserved.

This is tremendous. Thank you for existing

Thank you so much for doing this. They saved lives last night. I love our community so much

Ut Prosim!! ❤️

Thanks to every public safety official that responded.

Fund the police!

Great news actually! We just got a dominos order for 8 pizzas for our EMS friends!!

You could have just said thanks. President Biden Expands Funding After Republicans Voted Against Funding For The Police https://democrats.org/news/president-biden-expands-funding-after-republicans-voted-against-funding-for-the-police/

Think you need to take a break from Reddit then

Wasn't it Democrats almost two years ago who wanted police forces significantly defunded? Regardless, the page you linked gave some choice (out of context) quotes without really drawing any conclusions of their own, so using that as a source for whatever you were trying to prove probably isn't very effective.

And it's not even close The person that delivered this food has a much much much more dangerous job than these cops https://www.facilities.udel.edu/safety/4689/ Every doordash driver in america has a more dangerous job than cops

No. It was not Democrats who wanted police department budgets cut. Did your local police department lose funding? People with nothing else keep repeating it. Dog whistles are tired. What did people thanking the men and women who responded early Saturday morning have to do with Democrats? Money was given to the states to go to first responders that is fact. Our local police departments were not defunded. Thank the hardworking men and women who show up everyday. Keep it moving. You chose to make a political dig.

Looking at the replies you were the one that made this political for no reason what so ever.

I didn't mention any dog whistles. I was speaking to the one who did. You chose to answer to the whistle. You all can talk to yourselves. I donated money yesterday. I am done with this thread.

Modern problems require modern solutions

You can change the name of your phone to make it actually say Tim Sands if you want.

This makes me proud to be a Hokie

All right, can you just explain what's going on here?

Will never not up vote this when I see it.

Next time someone asks "What is a Hokie?", I'm answering "sports and broccoli." No other context.

The cut to that guy nodding with visible confusion gets me every time

This is the core of Hokie Nation <3

I went on a date w her friend and I met her dt. Definitely just as weird as she seems to be in this video

Didn't these guys come back last year? I remember them interviewing people on Center Street again, and someone said they specifically picked VT because of this video. They assumed it must be a fun place to be. Good job *sports* girl! 🥦

I actually know her lol

broccoli rocks!

r/iamveryrandom

Hi, thank you, I have no idea!

She loves sports and she loves broccoli, that’s why they were there.

That's a friend of mine lol. You can see me right of him in the black beanie. He didn't expect to be somewhat Hokie viral lol

When is this?

I believe this was the October before COVID? Center Street before what I think was the multi-OT game vs UNC. I was visiting friends in town and we wound up there

This man is paid over $4 million dollars a year and is 1-13 in one score games. If you’re going to be a waste of public funding at least be good at your job.

VT wasting money? no way

Really makes me appreciate Frank Beamer so much more. Even in a bad season Frank coached circles around Pry and Fuente. At least Pry is likable whereas Fuente was a prick. The best schools have offensive minded coaches. Tech also needs to vastly get bigger/hire a better S&C coach. Team has looked small all season compared to the competition.

Babcock is the bigger issue, prematurely extending contracts and making buyouts harder. He did it with Fuente and did it again recently with the coordinators

Flaming hot take, but I still think he has potential. We just REALLY need new coordinators, as Drones' injury has shown us. If he doesn't replace Bowen next season, we're in for another Fuente-Cornelsen special. It's not like we can afford the contract buyout right now anyways unless some ultra-wealthy donor comes through, so we might as well just replace the coordinators and see what happens.

It's 1-12 right? He was 1-4 in 2022, 0-3 last year, and 0-5 (lol) this year. Regardless, fire Whit Babcock 🙏

Fire Whit Babcock...I've been saying this since 2017

We're on our third string QB. We had no business being in the game, same with the Syracuse game, let alone being in a one score situation. Pry and the team got unlucky this season. I don't expect a win next week, but if Pop can settle into some throws, we will be alright.

And yet still a better coach than Mack Brown.

Pry may not get fired but the entire program needs an overhaul. Both coordinators need to go and the OL coach needs to be left on the tarmac. Pry needs to hire a "Jerry Kill" to act as an advisor because he coaches scared sometimes and makes boneheaded mistakes. Ballein needs to be escorted out of Merryman and the Whit needs to either take an active role in managing the football team or hire someone from a reputable P2 school who will. Fan engagement will quickly sink back to the end of Fuente's tenure if big measures aren't taken. The narrative during pre-season was we were dark horse favorites for the playoffs and yet we're banking on bearing UVA in the last game of the season to go to a shit bowl game. Fix your shit Whit and Pry.

You think 4 million is the going rate for a top 40 head coach right now? Try again? While I think if Pry doesn’t agree to fire Marve and some other staff he should be let go and if not serious improvements next year no matter the changes he needs to go the base salary is going to have to go up. It’s the cost of being a top 40 team today.

I’m not ready to give in just yet. There is improvement shown even though the record hasn’t. I think some of my biggest issues is he doesn’t show enough emotion. We’ve gotten fucked by ref calls multiple times this year and he just shakes his head. If he’s more in their ears throughout the game they probably give him a little more calls a la Saban. Also Tyler Bowen sucks. Our offensive playbook looks like a HS team. Get a real play caller in there. Also we win the cup and we’re still bowl eligible, consecutively. Give him time

Love the big image! Lmao

I'm a little frustrated, too, but I see him building a good culture and improving recruiting. The team IS getting better, but we're definitely not there yet. I'm willing to give him a few more years to do what he came to do. It's harder to complete these days, with the portal, but I feel good about him.

You can be paid $100,000 for 40 years and only make $4 million and this motherfucker makes it in one year shitting the bed

UVA guy here. He’s our double agent. We were gonna tell you when we finally win the game against you, but it’s not looking that way and his cover is close to being blown. I repeat, agent has been burned, abort abort.

Recruiting is the key to college football. I’m not sure how well Pry is doing but it has to be better than Fuentes

Sounds like HE is winning.

I’ll lose games for $3 million per year! Save money, hire me!

Yall expect a new coach to mean you immediately go 12-0. Imagine working somewhere that has had change in leaddrship and immediately becoming significantly more profitable. It's not that easy. Otherwise, every one would be doing it

Shoulda hired Shane

Reminds me of Frank Beamer’s first years. Also $4M isn’t crap in the coaching industry.

Scott Frost is that you?

I can see the pain in his eyes

As a chicago bears fan, I know ownership is eyeing him right now to be the new HC

Stay the course for two more years. Need to establish an identity. Some Of the losing close games is just bad luck. Some coaching. Some players.

We should’ve hired a coach who has at least made a national championship appearance or playoff appearance in recent years. Issue is we still look to continue Beamers legacy despite him winning the same amount of games as we are now for several years. Those days are long gone. Should’ve gone all in while we had the chance now we are so broke we are stuck with coordinators and mid major coaches for probably eternity.

The offensive coordinators might as well be a bunch of toddlers

I'll trade you coach ryan walters for this guy if you don't like him?

Not sure how I came across this thread. I’m a UK Fan. Stoops is paid 9M to go 4-7 & 1-7 in the SEC 😂. He can’t keep an OC or develop his own QB to save his life.

For a second I thought this was a post about Nebraska football. It must have come across my feed because of the one score less headline. Glad to see we aren’t the only ones with this issue.

As a Nebraska fan, I feel this in my bones

So you’re saying I could do better and be paid a fraction of what he is being paid. Sounds about right

Bacock ruined the Hokies.

Y’all act like we can’t pay players now legally. We just need to shut up and move over for more prestigious schools and oil money schools like SMU. Our QB gets paid half coach pry’s salary and he didn’t even dress. We put most our money into academics either we quit crying and let one of these coaches develop a program and winning tradition or it’s over

Does VA Tech athletics make more money than their expenses/scholarships?

Wait until you find out about politicians

Maybe I am ignorant but isn't a coach only as good as his team?

He was just fired! Sept. 14, 2025. 🙌

I'm not sure what it is but something needs to change.

I know the hate but really he is doing a good job with what we have. Now a casino should hire him as a cooler because his bad luck is statistically unreal.

Ya we hate him next question

cannot wait to see you coach a football team!

Frank Beamer’s start at VT: - 1987: 2-9 - 1988: 3-8 - 1989: 6-4-1 - 1990: 6-5 - 1991: 5-6 - 1992: 2-8-1 - 1993: 9-3 We gotta stick it out if we want our football program to be anything but perpetually mid “grass is greener on the other side” losers constantly in rebuild. Maybe Pry isn’t the guy. Very possible. But 3 years is not enough to judge with what was left to him. People have rose colored glasses to last season, getting this false notion that we were better last year and Pry is regressing. Nah. We got literally every single one of our conference wins versus all five of the worst teams in the ACC. Literally, all five. This year’s schedule with last year’s team, I doubt we crack 3 wins. Last year’s schedule with this team, we’d probably end with 9. We did better against every common opponent we faced, and we’ve been incredibly competitive in games that we would’ve gotten stomped in last year. We’re better this year than we were last year, and better than the year before that. Until this stops, the idea of firing Pry will be nothing but premature, short-sighted knee jerk reaction in my eyes.

The S&C program needs an overall redux. The Rutgers game when our o lineman got made to look like a weak lil bitch getting pushed into the QB causing a safety issue one of the most embarrassing things I’ve ever seen for a lineman

I agree 100x. Dude tried to be like the larger and more notorious programs with big contracts and buyouts to be in line with the industry but was a bad bad call. Florida, Texas A&M, Tennessee, Nebraska, type programs can afford to change coaches with large contracts and buyouts every 2-5 years but we can’t compete with them in the field so why act like we can compete in the contracts..

I think Pry deserves another year, but on the stipulation he cleans house on his staff. Marve, Holt, and Crooks need to be dismissed immediately. Bowen I’m 50/50 on - he’s shown some offensive creativity and ability to adapt with the injuries on offense. Pry just desperately needs experience surrounding him. Hiring first time coordinators with a first time head coach was such a terrible decision.

It’s maddening, and far more than just “bad luck”. My first priority is to get rid of Whit, considering the state and trajectory of our two biggest sports, Whit’s comments a few years ago about certain fans not mattering, and the growing discontent. I think things are too far gone unless we bring in new leadership to set things right.

Right? Just like the commanders have shown us this year, sometimes you have to cut the head off of the snake

After getting Buzz and Fuentes first year everyone thought the AD was a genius.

He is garbage as an AD. He's been here 10 years and run our revenue sports in the toilet.

I made tacos. Ate some. Just going back to sleep now.

HOKIE HOKIE HOKIE HI, I JUST WANNA FUKKIN DIE

But hey at least we still got general tso's

I know our secondary is hot garbage, but our refusal to leave the 4-2 was the most rage inducing piece of football i have ever seen.

Pretty much yeah

Thank you for my new zoom background

So that happened.

Me: This week can’t get any worse... UrinatingTree on Tuesday afternoon/evening: And now, time to represent the nominees for “LOLCOW of the Week”!!!

OP you a Detroit Lions fan? Lol pretty sure this came from us over at r/detroitlions

Cheers from West Virginia University

I got $5 on it

I need someone with hokiep money to sneak me out some, I've been feigning

General tso’s is all fun and games until you find a cockroach in your bowl.

and icing a kicker on a 59 yarder was really the cherry on top. Welcome to VT football

Can’t believe you chose sadness in Indiana over sadness in Blacksburg smh

The "i wanna die" meme is pretty ubiquitous, especially in sports. I wouldn't say it's uniquely tied to Lions fans, except insofar as Lions fans are uniquely acquainted with suffering.

Nothing can really top the Lions version haha. That sub makes some quality content, bless their hearts

Hopefully we still get to play you guys next year

I'm not upset about that, that's a typical thing to do. What you should be upset about was the failure to see what Liberty was doing after the timeout. Just out fucking coached in the last 10 seconds.

Beat the Buckeyes!

That’s all we know

Nah it’s pretty iconic in sports Reddit as a Lions meme. You can look up “I wanna die sports meme” on google and the first picture is the lions one and a lot of the search results are about the Lions one. The meme is most certainly associated with the Lions primarily

Lose or lose, the meme game is strong

No. You do not ice a college kicker whose career long was under 50 yards on a 59 yard kick. Period. That is foolishness to the nth degree. Fuentes excuse was even worse about not having the right personel on the field. He made a horrific call and refused to own up and made excuses.

Icing on a 59 yarder is not typical

Yeah I agree with that, lining everyone up for a hail mary wasn't the thing to do but the entire ending sequence was not great to watch. Really there aren't any excuses to be made so interested to see what people say.

Beat their ass!

How it feels trying to sleep in Lee

That and fire trucks. God damn I do not miss that dorm. Housing made a mistake and put me in there *as a grad student.* There was one night where there were multiple fire alarms in the night. Won’t forget that.

Honestly true, but at least being on the 7th floor gives us a nice view of those trucks

Lived on the 7th Floor of Lee in 1991-1992. Do they still broadcast WUVT from the roof there? The WUVT signal bled over into all of our analog (don't laugh) music sources (tape decks, fm tuners, guitar amps, etc). We could only listen to a CD or WUVT on the radio. We also had a 19.2 kbps serial data connection to the VT network through the back of our dorm phones and voicemail was not included in the dorm phone service. ($10/month extra if we wanted voicemail!). They got Ethernet a year or two later which at 10mbps was revolutionary. The early 90s was an amazing time in Blacksburg.

just wait until the snowplows start.

To be fair, that’s how it felt living in Pritchard too.

Galileo and Hypatia have difficulty keeping upperclassmen in the program literally because Lee Hall and living on campus in general (especially this year) is such garbage

Without fail.

Glad to hear that "the pit" hasn't changed that much since the 80's 😊

Dude I’m a senior now and freshman year was the total opposite. Lee Hall always had an injury or sexual assault or SOMETHING... must be flipped now

I see some things never change...

Wait you sleep?

As a former Pritchard resident, I cackled.

This is the goddamn truth right here

I'm currently on the first floor of Pritchard facing the pit. My window is right in front of the sewer, so my roommate and I can either blow one fan in and one out which will make the room smell like ass. The other option is what we went with - both window box fans blow air out of the room and we boil alive.

The other day my roommate and I were woken up by a garbage truck doing its thing around 7 AM for about an hour. Fun stuff.

> There was one night where there were multiple fire alarms in the night. Won’t forget that. I had that my freshman year in OShag. It was after the JMU game so I was already pissed, and there were JMU students staying in our dorm. They pulled the alarm *FIVE FUCKING TIMES THAT NIGHT!!!* No I’m not still mad, why do you ask?

Ah, I remember having two fire alarms in one night as well my freshman year back in 2012. What a disaster that dorm was. God I loved it.

I’ve got a great view of them coming down Washington every night!

I was on the 7th floor. What room? I couldn’t really see the much too well as I was in the corner room.

No, we broadcast from the Squires Student Center now.

Just did an internet speed test from my dorm in the first floor of Pritchard on my phone, I got 189 Mbps down and 298 Mbps with a multi connection. I've gotten the ethernet to get up to 800 to 900 form down and up. The problem now, is today eduroam will just randomly cut out and then reconnecting will take forever. It's really fast but really inconstant.

The coke machine is bolted to the wall now - ostensibly as a result of an "incident" involving same being cast off the roof into the pit in the 80s or 90s at some point. That's what they told us in the early 00s at least.

gotta let the garage truck do its job homie

Welcome to the adult world.

I remember when the studio was there is that where the transmitting tower is now too?

Interesting...how do you check it on your phone, do they have a Wi-Fi network in dorms for students or do they allow you to plug in your own router and have your own Wi-Fi network? I can see concrete block being they problem with the former, and interference being a problem with the latter.

I heard the same story. I was only in the actual pit (central courtyard) once: I decided to join the Christmas carolers in '84... The entire courtyard was filled with trash and we got mooned as we sang. Good times!

I lived in Lee but that was also the rumor that my friends who live in Pritchatd told me when we lived on campus in '91-'92

The transmit tower is on price mountain now

Dorms have wifi and ethernet Jack in.

I need a miracle, Hokie Nation My wife and I will be celebrating 23 years of marriage tomorrow, Oct 5. We’re at the homecoming game, celebrating with our friends and family in what I hope will be a win for the Hokies. Here’s where the miracle comes in. My wife just noticed that the diamond from her engagement ring fell out. Hokie Nation, I know the odds are astronomically impossible. But, if by ANY chance you find a princess cut diamond on campus, please DM me. I believe in miracles.

Did you take any photos together? I wonder if you can pinpoint where it was attached last or close to

The friends we made along the way were the real diamonds.

Replace with princess cut hokie stone

Where were you sitting? I know some alum from the group that cleans the stadium who may know current members that can look in that area

If you can't find it, get a lab grown diamond to replace it and you'll be good to go. Best of luck

Where did you go from parking, tailgating, game (what entrance). I’m in campus tomorrow and I have good eyes …. I’ll keep them peeled.

We got 23 pts for your 23 years, only problem is WF got 30 lmao

My brother is part of the Cadet battalion that cleans the stadium after every game. I asked him just in case 🙏

Eyes peeled

I'll keep a eye out

Following and sending hugs

Hokie fam member here, can you share your walk to the stadium from your transportation so we can get the hokies on it?

Replying to boost engagement of the post!

Maybe next week 👀

Any chance she washed her hands at the stadium?- it could be stuck in a sink trap.... true story - this happened to my brother with his VT school ring - a plumber got in touch with him when he found it in a sink trap at a wedding venue he was at - ten years prior!

I hope you all find it!

Hey I’m having trouble loading a picture but I just found a gemstone on campus. Let me know

What kind of clasp and how was it anchored into the ring?

Is the ring on your home insurance? They will just replace the stone

Did you get the warranty when you bought it? The stone can be replaced if so.

Close game and empty student seats. They don't deserve a good football team.

The sleuths in our group are analyzing photos but so far no clear timeline.

Thank you! We spoke to some staff but will give them a call as well.

114 UUU, thank you for the effort 🙏

I wish lab grown had really existed when i bought my wife's ring

Thank you! We parked at Historic Smithfield, walked on the trail by the Hokie stone staging area, through the AG parking lot, Washington through Cassell lot through Gate 4. I know it’s impossible odds, but who knows!

Thank you and thank you to your brother!

Thank you so much Hokie fam member! I noted our path above.

Much appreciated!

Wow! 10 YEARS later? That is simply amazing. This is worthy of pursuing, thank you for the idea!

Nevermind I think what I found is costume jewelry. Ugh. Sorry I wanted to be helpful

Tbf I don't think a premium increase or losing your homeowners policy is really worth a stone unless six figures.

Yup. And guess what they fucking lost. Students knew it was coming and so did I.

It's funny how depending on the season, Tech can look like a mystical Hogwarts wonderland and in this picture looks like West Point or some military base, lol

Holden got torn down??

ahhh good ol slusher, sticking out like a sore thumb as always. somehow the knowledge that no matter how far away it’s being viewed from, it’s still ugly, is comforting to me. some things truly never change

Wow this is a beautiful and surprisingly high resolution picture. What was this taken on?

Thanks for the desktop background

Selfie with me and Tim Sands

That's pretty low flying, are you the bloke who's seemingly always flying around campus?

I spent a good amount of time looking into whether there was a service you could pay for a flight around campus while I was at VT and wasn't able to find much. Would still be really cool to do as an amateur photographer.

I might have your flight path recorded for this flight depending on the day this was flown. If you want, I can export it to a file you can view in Google Earth (explorable in 3D).

Slusher reigns

Any way to upload the full quality images? To google drive or something like that? It’s showing me a reddit link which is probably compressed..

Is that you always in the plane?

I wanna say I can see my apartment from up here but it's blocked by trees.

Please do not jump off the plane!

It all depends on the saturation. Doesn't look like OP edited the picture. The Hogwarts ones turn up saturation a lot.

That's because this picture has a really warm tone to it. A cooler picture with high saturation and contrast can make it look like hogwarts !

Sweet pic of Lane, you should get one during a game!

They’re gonna renovate it

>some things truly never change Soooooo I don't know how to tell you this buuuuuuut....

Hey! I use a Canon T7i and took this on a 200mm lens so it's pretty zoomed-in from how far we actually were from campus.

There are a lot of people who learn to fly out of the Blacksburg airport. Many of them are doing touch and go practice flights. Also recently there has been a few mapping aircraft in the area. If you want to see what's flying overhead, I'm currently monitoring the local aircraft self reported positions in the NRV (and well beyond). http://128.173.193.125:30053

I'm currently monitoring the local manned aircraft self reported positions. http://128.173.193.125:30053 You can probably find the plane flying on the map and check it's registration info.

I can see my bar from here!

Restricted air space.

Damn dude this is hella cool! Thanks for the info.

awesome, thanks!

A good old meme.

me: my whole body hurts and i have chills. I think I need a test. schiffert: we’re kinda busy rn. did you try putting it in rice?

Me: Having chills and a fever Schiffert: Come get a test, but we dont have parking so you will need to ride the bus or get a ride.

Throwback to freshman year when they gave my roommate codeine for a cough

I always got asked if I was pregnant an uncomfortable amount of times. Me: No. Unless it was immaculate conception. They did diagnosis my Shingles. Shout out for getting me the right prescription ASAP.

Don't forget the codeine

In 2010 my gf, now wife, went to schiffert and basically told them "I have a UTI, I need antibiotics" on a Friday. They took a sample and then said "well have results on Monday, come back then. We can't give out antibiotics unless it's positive.". By Sunday morning it was bad enough for an ER visit to Montgomery General and the attending doc was horrified and said if she had waited until Monday it probably would be a bladder infection and be infinitely more difficult to treat. Schiffert sucks, better off finding and using a free clinic if you don't have your parents insurance.

ok but I actually feel sick and called them and they gave me an appointment within 3 hours of the call. I’ve read a lot about them sucking at handling this but so far they’ve treated me better than I’d be treated at home

“Are you sure you aren’t pregnant?”

To be fair, for the 'rona there is fuck-all they can actually do except tell you to avoid people and go to the hospital if you have trouble breathing.

I went to Shiffert once feeling sick and they told me it was either a viral infection, a bacterial infection, or allergies. I guess that rules out cancer...

me: doesn’t have covid schiffert: yes you do

One time I had a 105 degree fever with mono induced hepatitis. I was on the liver transplant list a week after I left schiffert. The doctor there told me a neti pot would solve my problems. Lol

Try joining the military. Oh you got your arm torn off? Ibuprofen.

HAHAHAJAHAHAHAHAH

i’m getting tested and when i asked about parking they asked me to take the bus. i was actually shocked

HAHAHAHAHAHAHA or ask your friend to give you a ride

Freshman year I had bacterial bronchitis, viral bronchitis, and aspergillus pneumonia back to back to back. They gave me so much codeine I was worried I'd end up having withdrawal after.

I have a feeling that practice has ceased but back in the early 2010s I could fake a cough and get codeine pretty much whenever I wanted. Dumb, newly freed kids and access to unlimited codeine is not a good combination.

Unfortunately that's just a standard healthcare question. Most charting programs require that question be asked in order to proceed with the EMR. If you're a female under 65 you'll get asked that at almost every medical exam. There are two main reasons for asking that question. 1) pregnancy can contraindicate many prescriptions and even some medical proceedures. 2) to rule out pregnancy as a cause for symptoms. The follow up question is often are you taking birth control or using other contraceptives. That is to rule out the hormonal influence of the birth control pill or implant. Many patients forget or don't consider birth control to be a medication, so when the provider asks "do you normally take any medication", patients leave birth control out. Source: former paramedic

I had indirect contact and they still scheduled me for an appointment. Sadly they said test results will take 3-4 days :/

It’s just a meme :)

If you think you have it, just quarantine/isolate if you would need to expose people in order to get tested. Prioritize keeping the community safe over being a datapoint if possible.

Things Schiffert is good at: Enabling the opioid crisis Giving notes to get out of class Things Schiffert is not good at: Helping people get healthy

No this was 2017

they initially with all the freshman took 24-48 hours. weird that the time frames slowed down as time progressed

That's still better than most of the USA iirc

exactly. my point is that tech is putting students at risk even further by making kids with covid ride the bus

My guess is test results are taking longer because Shiffert doesn’t run the test themselves, they ship it off to a lab, there’s really not that many labs in the US and colleges everywhere are having outbreaks so they’re getting backed up. A few weeks ago, my friend had to wait over 2 weeks for her test to come back which is pretty pointless at that point. (She’s not a college student, just using regular healthcare)

Great! I hope others are just as aware. It's silly we have to know better than the health center.

Tech actual runs them at Fralin

Fralin in Roanoke, which is now back to also processing tests from around the NRV, not just VT.

TIL, thanks

I rebuilt a chair from Cassel Coliseum with original 1962 parts that were being tossed!

First and foremost, I want to thank Reddit for bringing awareness to the recent May 2020 renovations that to my knowledge have removed the last of the original 1962 wooden seats in Cassel Coliseum. The reconstruction process came with a few challenges including that there are over 3 different seat widths and to make one seat they all need to be the same. In fact, this is the reason I’m missing the arched number board at the top. Other challenges included finding the right fasteners to securely lock everything in place including the addition of 2 large brackets to support the massive cantilevered force. I was luckily able to find a manufacturer for these brackets, [Archer Seating](https://archerseating.com/product/cassell-coliseum-chair-bracket/) who hooked me up with a fantastic deal on some extra parts he had with a “bad paint job.” All in all, the chair came out to a weight of exactly 50lbs and I’m very pleased with how it turned out! Other news, I am selling individual boards from the back section in a variety of lengths and wood tones. These can be seen in the last photo and from the original vintage seats. I may also have the capacity to sell other parts including seats and brackets in the near future but quantities will be very limited. If anyone has specific questions I’m more than happy to answer them below:

That’s amazing!! ....I made a sandwich today D:

Cool. I've always wanted a really uncomfortable wooden chair. JK, nice job.

Andrew I’ve found ur Reddit hehe

That looks great!

Awesome job, looks great. That being said, $96 for 2 brackets with wood is criminal

Amazing ! Hokie proud

Looks like the one my buddy puked on at the Duke game! Lol. Awesome job man!

Lucky.....by the time my sister got there they had the cops protecting the pile so that it could go to the trash.

Grab some extra

What body of water is that? Are you in Hampton Roads?

Woah! It looks great! Where did you get the part to connect it to those wood slabs so it stands up by chance? Custom made? Only asking because my boyfriend and I were able to rebuild a few sets but really havent thought about making it.. stand alone (mines currently in my apartment leaning against the wall)

Dang where'd you find those parts?

What type of sandwich may I ask?

Sandwich tax. Post on r/sandwiches

TIL: I have a lot of friends on reddit

Hence why I I did the wood feet myself and got discounted brackets with a slightly off paint job that I could just fix :p To his credit, they are really good quality brackets

Rule 101: don’t make your Reddit name your full name Jasmine

I did clean off about 50 years worth of gunk, eww

When I was there the workers were handing the pieces straight to us from the bins they were rolling out

Nearby, yes

If you’re talking about the two black L brackets, see my top comment for the link!

Caught the guys who were removing them before they made it to the dumpster!

A classic ham n’ cheese, hahaha

Hahaha I saw the picture and was like wow I just saw this on insta! But also this is literally so cool

That house across from your pier looks familiar I think I have kayaked by there that is why I asked.

Nice catch!

Appreciate it. Read the other commenters and you may recognize someone else!

No excuses ma’am

That's actually amazing! A full 2 years before I even made a Reddit account. Maybe you're not old and I'm just a child.

I know of 2 college subs that are larger. So, we're at least number 3

Ikr. I always wanted to remove stuff bc it was the same post everyday. This way it’s better.

Blame the college not the sub lol

If you downvoted me then you were part of the problem 😂

Dude I love statistics and I was hoping you could share some! 1.5 million is insane

>1.5 million is insane This honestly blew my mind too. I think it's a shame traffic info is only available for mods. Here's some more graphs for someone that also likes stats :) [Traffic by day of the week](https://i.gyazo.com/beb30ce0194a649680bbce8adb769c60.png) [Graphing views by day](https://i.gyazo.com/35ae986edf0587e5e53b12bd97967297.png) [And even views by hour!](https://i.gyazo.com/4e1ed4b541c658f28040ab47fc8b201b.png) I'm always happy to share what cool info I have!

Happy to see I make up part of the slim ribbon of “old reddit” users haha Any chance I could see the traffic stats for the last 12 months?

The old Reddit users surprised me too since that's all I use. Also, of course. I don't see any precise numbers for the last 12 months. However, we are supplied a [graph for page views](https://i.gyazo.com/ce28d77dff0aab6063ad9be633689f10.png) going back to Nov 2019. Note that Sept/Oct obviously don't appear to have updated, yet. All together it's super interesting data. Noticeable upticks around covid starting and freshman getting ready to come.

Yep, this was exactly what I wanted to see! I’ve managed subreddits in the past so I always find these statistics interesting. The freshman spike is way larger than I envisioned and the covid spike was expected

Just answer yes or no

I'm further perplexed by the decision not to test contacts at the end of the 14 day quarantine. How are they to know with certainty that a person is not an asymptomatic carrier?

The funniest thing is unless i'm crazy VT admitted they aren't including self-reported covid results in their counts. So, for example, if you got tested off-campus at the hospital and then answered YES to this question... they still wouldn't count you ;)

Oof. Sounds like VT is doing a less than stellar job. Glad I'm alum this year. Honestly I would probably consider taking the year off if I were a student. Stay safe, Hokies.

Students: No. VT: Understandable, have a great day

Apparently to them no symptoms = no covid

If they're tested positive off-campus, they're cases in somewhere else, not cases in VT, so VT wouldn't count them; otherwise they're double counted across the country.

From a student’s perspective, we already feel as though we’re losing time, opportunities, and overall a profoundly valuable part of our lives. We don’t want to lose anymore. The push to shut down the country for a measly two weeks and close borders like some European countries did failed miserably. So most of us, instead of taking a year off, do what the officials tell us and try to make the very most out of what we have

Yeah I pushed this idea all summer and ended up enrolling in 5 courses myself because I’m a senior and turning 26 this summer so I literally can’t push this back any further without not having insurance next year lol

Except they should be able to easily report that it is a double test while still keeping their dashboard up to date with actual numbers of infected student on or off campus. JMU for example does include self-reported students meaning the 500 cases it had that got it shutdown could be the truth in VT as well depending on how many off-campus ones they're ignoring on dashboard. Obviously double counting would be bad but it's just as bad for that VT dashboard to imply there are fewer student cases than is true and I have to imagine there is a way to update that dashboard to keep public informed without misrepresentation to country/state

That’s just factually not true. Schiffert is overwhelmed and students have been calling other healthcare providers around town and the surrounding areas to get tested while still living local and having some in person classes. Their dashboard is just inaccurate.

Well everyone is facing profound setbacks this year, so you won't be far behind the rest of your age group. Some people are facing more challenges in terms of loss of loved ones and mental health.

For foreign visitors tested positive upon arrival, they're traced back to their departing country but still only considered a case in the arrival country. I agree that VT can include another number for self-reported cases as long as they come to campus (otherwise it doesn't make sense) and are not infected for the second time. The infected students can be fully online somewhere else, thus not counted as a case in VT. However I'm not sure when the self-reporting students get tested. They may be already recovered if they were infected months ago.

Maybe I honestly don't know a ton about it just saw some people on jmu complaining they have friends at VT who cases weren't counted cuz they got tested off campus. Might just be cray

I thought everyone should be tested here in VT. Well for on-campus students at least.

When you're far away from Blacksburg and run into someone who is also wearing VT gear

I was walking through an airport in Montana at like 6:30 in the morning and the place was deserted and lo and behold I hear at a distance " let's go Hokies"!

Made this gif to accurately portray an interaction I had recently, thought I'd share

It is known

Love it! Go Hokies!

I was just in Wisconsin and saw a VT flag!

Had this happen in Switzerland and I was so caught off guard

Literally happened to me today when someone saw my VT headcovers on my golf clubs.

me 3 years ago at the guinness storehouse in ireland :0

On my typical \~40 mile morning commute in Jersey, I often see the same two cars with hokie stickers and magnets, and there is often a friendly wave shared between the other drivers and me. Probably 1-3 times weekly for the last three years. wholesome alumni base

I love all y’all!! Go Hokies!!!

Hahaha. Yes! Happened in Alaska to me!

Driving along the 210 west of Pasadena many, many years ago a car overtook my wife's, honked, gave the thumbs up and mouthed something. We were all WTF? Then as he passed we saw the guy had a VT bumper sticker - he was yelling "Go Hokies". (Our vanity plate was HOKIE1) We're everywhere.

Happened to me at a pizza shop and a target.

Happened to me in an airport in Thailand lol

Few years back I went to Disney World and saw more Hokies than I expected. It truly is the happiest place on earth.

I used to travel a few times a year to China for work (Covid obviously stopped that). There was a bar in Shanghai that had a VT pennant on the wall. I always made a point to swing in there to see if I could run into another Hokie. Also, I religiously wear a VT hat and/or shirt on airplanes for this exact reason. I love running into other Hokies away from Blacksburg, especially on the other side of the world. It brings back a little feeling of home.

Happened to me yesterday. Held a door for a man at Wawa that was a Tech grad.

Saw a hokie on a volcano in hawaii, they’re everywhere……..

Is a true thing

Same thing for me in Dortmund. The farther away from Blacksburg it happens the more of an event it becomes.

Hold up was this like a week ago in Seward? 😂😂

No way! That happened to me too in December 2019. Came across two people from VT on the way to Thailand. I was also just recently admitted back then.

Wow don't see that town mentioned much on reddit (or anywhere else) my family is from bear creek

Ahahaha litttt. Yeah I ran into a cube car with a bunch of VT stickers the other weekend down in Seward and sprinted up to say whats up lmao

Never tell me the odds.

"So you're saying there's a chance?"

I was so anxious this week worrying about the impossible. I feel so much better now

UVA snatched defeat from the jaws of victory.

We are the 1%!

What was all that one in a million talk?

Please consider donating On October 21, 2024, Cadi was riding her motorcycle to class, at Virginia Tech, when she approached an intersection on campus. However, an oncoming driver allegedly failed to yield on their yellow left turn, crossing into Cadi's path. With little to no time to react, Cadi and her motorcycle collided with the driver's SUV. Cadi was ejected from her motorcycle, landing on the other side of the SUV before quickly losing consciousness. As MedFlight was unable to respond fast enough, Cadi was rushed to LewisGale Montgomery Hospital via ambulance. Due to the critical nature of her injuries, she was then airlifted to Carilion Roanoke Memorial Hospital, a Level 1 Trauma Center. Things will be very difficult for Cadi and her family for an extended period. Health insurance will cover some, but not all, of her medical expenses, which are anticipated to be very high. In addition to medical expenses, her family will incur many other costs to rearrange their lives around her recovery, such as time off from work, travel, lodging, etc. We are also expecting added tuition costs from extending her academic career. Any donations will go toward assisting the family and Cadi as she recovers and adjusts to her changed life.

The person who hit her - did their insurance pay anything towards her medical bills? Poor Cadi. My heart goes out to her and her family.

Get well soon Cadi!!!! We’re so sorry about Virginia drivers.

From UVA but saw this post on my feed for some reason. Y’all are good people and upvoted so it’s higher up. Hoping for a speedy recovery.

I remember seeing the post about the accident - so happy to see her friends mobilizing to help her recovery! Thank you for sharing.

Her family can apply for relief through Carillon. My sister in law did it when she had a very premature baby, and they basically footed the bill that was like millions of dollars. Do not just take the bill at face value. They are an incredible institution with great doctors and big hearts. Look up any kind of relief that can be leveraged - grants, admin, government relief etc. I hope she gets better quickly.

Glad to hear she’s gonna make it. Don’t speed or take risks while driving, especially on motorcycles, everyone. It’s fun, but not worth this

Donated what I could. Having a good support circle for her is the best thing you can do for somebody in her position and it seems like she has that—Speaking from experience. If you guys could post this on instagram as well, I’d be more than happy to repost it and spread further awareness. This subreddit will have very low exposure compared to other social medias. VT’s Snapchat story is also a guaranteed 2000-5000 views.

Donated! Damn get better soon

I saw the aftermath of the accident. I’m so so glad she’s alive. I thought there was no way the person lived. So many positive thoughts for this family

Donated. Never went to Tech this just showed up in my feed. I am a fellow motorcyclist though and have lived through and recovered from some pretty bad trauma. Best wishes Cadi, sending positive thoughts for a strong recovery.

Poor girl 💔 praying for a quick and miraculous healing for her

Sad, Really sorry.

Yes… motorcycles kill. Very dangerous to ride.

The other driver’s insurance will take months if not years to pay out.

A driver failed to yield, turned into her - and your comment is "don't take risks on your motorcycle"? She was commuting.

The old 'blame the victim.'

From what I understand she was wearing full gear and I wouldn't be surprised if that saved her life

You’re silly. Any vehicle can kill.

Then why do people still get health insurance if it doesn't even pay out in a timely manner

Respectfully, “be safe” is not a controversial take. And I know there’s no way for me to not sound like a dick when I say this, so again, respectfully— —but I saw it happen. She was speeding and when the car turned tried to swerve around it. There’s fault on both sides, man. They were both commuting, I doubt either one went out and decided to have a wreck that day

The old “trying and failing to maintain the moral high ground for internet points.”

They're not talking about medical insurance but instead drivers/car insurance which would cover the liability if/when the driver is found liable in court or if her lawyers and the insurance lawyers agree to a settlement (not a fast process). Also there's the risk of the driver only no/low insurance policy (in Virginia that's currently only $30,000 for personal injury/death) Basically her health insurance will pay whatever they pay more or less immediately, the remainder either gets paid out of pocket or becomes medical debt, then her family sues the other driver and their car insurance company, the either the insurance settles (slow) or they go to court (even slower), the other drivers car insurance then pays out according to their policy.

How do you know she was speeding?

Then maybe in the future you should clarify that you were a witness and they were also at fault (but you weren't going to do that, were you?) And regardless, every fucking time someone gets hit on their bicycle/motorcycle there are comments like your first one implicitly blaming them for being hit by a car, even if they *were* being safe. The message is "it was the person on two wheels' fault for just being on the road."

You have no reason to be this rude nor to put such words in my mouth. Take your attitude elsewhere because I’m not going to entertain the fight that you’re clearly seeking

You must be fun at parties.

Virginia Tech women’s basketball advances to the Final Four [84 to 74 Ohio State]

LETS GOOOO!!!!

Honestly have enjoyed watching the women's bracket more this year thanks to this team. Makes a Class of 2020 alum proud haha

I'm starting to genuinely believe this might be the best team that Tech has ever fielded in any sport ever. Beamer/Vick era included.

Next up, LSU 7pm this Friday 3/31

Huge win. What a team

Awesome game, ladies! Lets Go Hokies!

Crowd in Seattle sounded great! LET'S GOOOO

Women's basketball school!

Special special team!

Incredible performances this weekend. LETS GOOOOO

As a Dallas Hokie I was super excited to be able to go to the next game… until I realized tickets started at $279 a piece

LSU HATE WEEK‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️

How can I get tickets to the game? I am student? Go Hokies!

Emphasis on TEAM.

Tennessee beat LSU a few weeks ago

They're flying straight to Dallas

it doesn’t matter if you’re a student or not for away games. you’d have to buy them online.

Let the lady Hokies handle them. Or whatever happens.

Hey, no looking ahead. They got one game left. Win that and they got one game more.

Not saying LSU is going to be an easy win, but based on who theyve played and how they've played, I was more worried about the prospects of facing OSU than I am of LSU. Hoping Iowa can take care of SC

For some reason I couldn’t find the new ticket. Guess still being processed. Plus it’s a home game

don’t think we’re on the same page haha. we’re talking about the final four. it’s in dallas. the next home game will be next season.

Bruh your right! I just looked it up damn lol. I definitely can’t go to Dallas. I guess streaming it is lol

yeahhh we only play at home during the regular season and then again if we get to host during the ncaa tournament earlier stages

Good to know! Hopefully the squad gets the dub

How do I still have 8AMs?

I got an online class 15 minutes after a face-to-face class on campus, I really hope the professor just gives us recorded lectures, I'm not trying to watch live zoom lectures on my laptop on campus.

See y'all on reddit between synchronous zoom classes

Bruh am I the only one who only has 2 online classes

Why does intro to ISe only exist on 8am

Oh boy can’t wait for 5 of my 8 classes to be online

I have small classes and yet I only have one in person lecture?? I did not agree to this

Y'all, there's some 4/16 survivors on this subreddit and maybe one VT person pointing a gun at another is not something they were hoping to see today.

I’m in the same boat, and my in-person lecture is an 8am...

I have the opposite issue, so I hope I can find a good route

Same here, right after ochem lab ;-;

How do I know if my class is online or not? None of my classes show in-person anywhere on HokieSPA.

Yeah I only have 2. The rest are in person lectures. I’m not too upset about that.

Friday morning too😐

Because intro classes are like that.

Bruh how’re you taking 8 classes?

Why is this getting downvoted? Its an honest question.

Same boat here.

HokiaSpa > Classic Student Schedule > Fall 2020

I’m taking a bunch of easier classes Bc I’m a GEOG major, also have some stupid corps classes to take which really only j take up time

Because it's obviously not about that, and by bringing it up, it assumes that my intent was to be insensitive to the history of the school. This is a prominent meme format that I used to make a joke about online classes, nothing else. I care just as much about 4/16 as any hokie should, and participate in the fundraising and booth setup of the memorial run. It's a false accusation, and if these feelings are so deeply stired by a meme I posted, the ability to downvote and continue scrolling is always available.

It's fine, I should have expected it. It's just disappointing.

Thank you! I did not know this option existed.

**URGENT** Need a fake boyfriend for Thanksgiving Date Has to be someone staying in Blacksburg over break. I am f(20). $50 compensation (can negotiate…) + I will pay for everything. Details provided on a need to know basis. Serious inquires only

Coming this fall to the Hallmark Channel, staring Lyndsy Fonseca, "Ut Prosim for Thanksgiving." (But seriously, good luck OP, this sounds like the best worst idea ever).

I'm following this just so we can have the post-Thanksgiving briefing of how this goes. I mean, whoever takes up this offer better be AWESOME at making up stories for dinner conversation. Like, completely off the wall but somewhat believable stories about OP.

Update: After going through all 37 DM’s I received, I have successfully found a fake date!! Thank you all for helping me make this train wreck be a little less brutal! I’ll update after thanksgiving!!

Damn when my prospects of getting a date are higher on reddit than they are on tinder...

Screw it I’m game. Male, grad student, reasonably attractive, very charming, can lay it on thick to the parents. Hobbies/ things I can talk about: wood working, the outdoors, car/motorcycle stuff, science, sustainability, social issues. Also a really good cook (can bring an impressive side). I can be funny and witty if you get a few drinks in me. Throw in 50 more dollars and a bottle of bourbon and I’ll pick a fight with your racist uncle (optional, only if you’re looking for the classic thanksgiving experience) PM me to chat and for pics if you want Edit: I heard from her, she had already picked another ~~victim~~ volunteer. We made a good run of it, thanks for everyone’s support. If anyone else needs my services I’ll be here all week. OP, we all wish you the best. Please let us know how it goes. Happy Thanksgiving!!

Staying over break but this sounds like a human trafficking / kidnapping attempt lol. STAY AWAY BOIS AND STAY SAFE

UPDATE: Fake date went extremely well. He clearly remembered our fake backstory and added some details to make it more interesting. Also was way funnier than my version! My parents full on loved him (kept mentioning it after he left & before they did) and he did a great job entertaining my dad with sports/outdoors stories. Date boy was raving about my/my moms cooking, so that was an added plus! Also, he offered to do it for free, so it was the best $50 I never spent! (Not saying his name per his request) Might try to stay friends!!

Keep the money, I'd do it for the fun of it.

Throw in a bag of chips and a lego set Alternatively: “I have a boyfriend but he goes to a different school so you wouldn’t know him”

You could just say that they went home for Thanksgiving, so he won't be there.

Is there a return offer if this “internship” goes well?

Whoever does this, has to act like they’ve never heard of a potato before.

Show up with a girl. That'll shut them up. 😂😂😂

Oh yeah. I saw this movie already.

this sounds too good to be true

I’d read this book

Shit that’s a 5 hour drive. I’d do it for the shits and giggles.

Please vlog it. I’ll pay $10

$50 and free food? I’d say sign me the fuck up but sadly I’m out of town

I feel like this is the introduction to a Hallmark movie

I'm invested now OP; you should post an update on how this turns out.

Please update us when done

Wait, let me ask my girlfriend..

What is this doctor who

I would help😂

we need updates on this lol

You white people are strange

Ah yes I too just watched the Holidate on Netflix

I’m totally in this is my dream

Man, the boosters are really taking advantage of the new NIL rules.

damn I never thought I’d see the day lmaaooo

i’ve read this book 12 times

Yeah we're gonna need an update and story next week.

Someone go and just turn the conversation to politics at every chance

There better be an update post later or we riot.

About to send my son back to Blacksburg for the holiday. 😂

Today’s the day we gonna need updates

Okay u/Due_Elderberry5204, what about that update? Did the both of you fall in love like in the movies?

Can we have a follow up on this OP?

This was the post I didn't know I needed in my life

Lol I love this

Remind me! 6 days

So how did this work out?

We need an update! How did the TG date go?

This wins the "Best of r/VirginiaTech award!!

Imagine the outrage if you flip the sexes in this.

Make it $60 dollars and I am in I am 21 and get to Blacksburg Wednesday the week of thanksgiving my name is Jack soyer

Drop a pic of your face first lmao

Don’t have enough spoons to write more about this today other than to say I think it’s a shame that NCB isn’t Librescu Hall by now, even if it would cause those of us that are still here some distress. I avoid the NW side of The Drillfield as much as I can because of what it still does to my day, but the memorial isn’t for me. I know that. Also, the 23rd student was Minu Pinchal. Let’s not forget her just because she practiced Ut Prosim in a different way: https://www.remembrance.vt.edu/biographies/panchal.html

I cannot stress this enough, UT prosim doesn't even do this man justice. It is respectful but a man like this is leagues better than the best hokie. Not just a good hokie but a brave individual.

We petitioned to have New Cadet Hall named LaPorte Hall, but they told us to kick rocks. It's a money matter, not a matter of doing something incredible. Inb4 they let people name it after themselves so that people donate to the university. The university got the money for Femoyer, Thomas, Monteith, and Major Williams Hall, didn't they?

Agreed. Also nice name. Have you ever ut prosimed... have you ever ut prosimed *on weeeed*? Sadly the university is wary of even reminding people of the tragedy. Dr. Librescu absolutally deserves a named building, far more than some rich guy who gave a donation.

He was cool guy. I had him for Dynamics back in like '02 or '03. I fucked around and kept screwing up school, so it took me many extra years to graduate. I remember seeing him in the hall years after I had taken his class. He remembered me and picked me out of the crowd to chat and see how I was doing. He remembered the plans I had for post-graduation life that I must have mentioned in passing and was legit concerned about me. He gave me some strong encouragement, telling me it wasn't too late at all, to just keep going and I'd get there eventually. How the fuck did he remember so much about some random student from a class he taught years earlier? I guess he just cared... I still had friends in ESM when the shooting happened. I remember that night they passed around an email to faculty saying that two profs were unaccounted for. They didn't come out and say what had happened to either, but Drs. Librescu and Granata were listed as status unknown. The second I heard that I knew Librescu had died doing something heroic, I fucking knew it. RIP. (Granata did too, he left the safety of the 3rd floor to try and pull injured students to safety - the shooter never stepped foot on the 3rd floor).

Marlena was a saint. She had such a capacity for empathy and thoughtfulness. A mother to every Hokie that came looking for the hug they didn’t even know they needed. I never met anyone that knew them both that didn’t consider them a single entity. If every spouse aspired to be just half the partner those two were for each other, we’d all live happily ever after.

That’s not really how the UCTC works though. The university will let you fund a building, sure, but the committee’s vetting process to name it is more stringent than what candidates for national office go through. Especially now that Barringer and Lee have been renamed. One single objection can kill a name. Even naming Chem-Phys after President Hahn took four years despite his name being on the building next door for the previous 15. Most agree they simply gave up trying to pass a new name and combined the two buildings instead.

It isn’t called *higher* education for nothing. EDIT: I’m out of town, please hit me up next week.

Agreed. It makes my blood boil that the school refuses to name buildings so they can use them as bait for mega donations instead of naming them after people who deserve it. People who inspire us, and who's names need not be forgotten. People who we should want to be like. NCB should be Librescu Hall and New Cadet Hall should be LaPorte hall. Even if you give them the benefit of the doubt and say they're trying not to remind people of the tragedy, its still a bad look. We shouldn't forget anyway.

He did something very similar for me. I did well in class and on homework, but struggled on the tests. He took me aside and gave me some encouragement, convinced me to try harder. A great man.

Okay but here's the thing. Lee was largely renamed because a small group of people decided to dredge up the history of the man it was named for and REPEATEDLY and LOUDLY trumpeted it to anyone and everyone who would listen, to the point where the university was forced to hasten the naming process. Some of the testing centers and ballrooms have simply been named for the person who paid for them as well. I see absolutely no reason why a person couldn't, for example, campaign for Homecoming Royalty on the message of getting a hall named after Librescu. That might make the issue high profile enough to force the university's hand.

The university administration doesn’t give a first thought about who wins homecoming whatever. That’s just a handful of kids pining after their high school days when their parents come to town.

It was an example. And I guarantee you that *anything* that potentially influences the school's image is going to be on their radar. Look at what happened after that article about SGA went out. Reorganization task force is called up immediately, after years of previously attempting and failing to get them to reform SGA.

The petition /u/YutBrosim mentioned had almost 50k signatures. Again, it’s not that simple. Also, SGA carries about as much weight as homecoming queen. They’re not associated with the administration. Remember that I agree about NCB becoming Librescu Hall, I just know the system better than to believe it will ever happen.

> SGA carries about as much weight as homecoming queen Especially now that they're effectively being formally written out of the governance process, yes. > Remember that I agree about NCB becoming Librescu Hall, I just know the system better than to believe it will ever happen. I agree that it's unlikely, but after everything that has happened in this past year, I simply can't take anything for granted anymore. The unthinkable has been happening almost every day for a year now. I wouldn't say "never" about anything anymore.

SGA never had a seat at the table. The BOV liaisons for undergrad and graduate students sit above them and aren’t always members of SGA. Even before the drama, SGA was just kids playing Model UN: Academia Edition.

There was at least the illusion that they actually did something, at least on the Student Affairs level. No student (even the BOV Liaisons) really have control or say in what the university does at the BOV level.

So this is the place everyone's talking about

Make sure you hit up Sunday brunch but idk if you’ll find a table in there

D2 shit(s)post. Nice.

Is this where the hot chili challenge does things to my ass?

Try the grey stuff, it's delicious!

Honestly you’ll probably find better food in there

Corn dog nuggets covered in nacho cheese.

D3 coming on strong.

The winner of the D2 dash iiiissss.... OHHHH PPPEEEEE

Please explain

D2 always gave me the shits, but dear god its brunch was amazeballs. Also, RIP Schultz breakfast.

Don't believe me? Ask the dishes!

OP found the auxiliary D2 location.

D2 is a dining center on campus.

RIP Schultz. Gone from campus, but not from our hearts and stomachs. F

D Squared as they call it

Is it a closet

Anyone miss the crowds?

I don’t think I’ve ever missed the Qdoba line until now

No crowds is the only good part of the pandemic lmao

The way I graduated spring but am seasonally craving origami.....

I have to say, I don't miss the crowds to get Qdoba and even get a seat. It's kinda nice

Are the Turner restaurants closed this semester?

About as much as I’d miss a kidney stone.

Been using my remaining on campus plan solely for Qdoba and rice. Having no line has been perfect, but I hope it stays that way for as long as possible

It's actually brilliant without the crowds 😛 Plenty of parking, no long queues at restaurants! Wish it all stays the same, **WITHOUT** the pandemic 😑

No not at all

I was there at 2pm on Friday. There were a decent number of people in there.

As an introvert I endorse this advertisement for the pandemic.

Origami is only serving sushi

not sure why you're downvoted. As someone who's not on campus anymore, I have no idea what this meme is referring to. Also, who in their right mind would miss crowds of any kind?

Coming from a worker. So we are open but brueggers closes at like 3, sometimes the rest close earlier just cause, and everything is grubhub.

me too brother

how are you getting in without being a freshman?

... are you British?

best local comedy account right here folks

as an ambivert i do not

No chicken rice and yum yum? Guess I can pass on the four hour drive.

Say sike. You’re telling me no hibachi and yum yum?

That’s false

This post makes me feel old. It's the opening video sequence for the original COD4 Modern Warfare that came out when I was a freshman at VT in 2007.

Its referencing the fact that everybody feels the need to eat lunch between 11-1, so by 2 there aren’t any lines

He better watch that edge too it’s sharp but also very edgy

You couldn’t buy it if they were serving it... only meal plan money is accepted and off campus can’t purchase them.

I haven’t found when they’re selling it

Sometimes they’re selling it

When are they open then cuz I’ve been trying to get lunch there

Oh yeah, I know the meme. What I don't understand is how it applies to Turner is at the present moment as I've been gone for 3 years.

No, it's that last semester you had to swim through crowds, and now it's absolutely dead

> It's actually brilliant Oh, no reason...

You said queue instead of line

They could probably still load up their Hokie P with some money. Also an alumni so I don't actually know, but I would imagine you could.

M-F before 3pm I think

Ah. I prefer queues :P And no, I'm not British.

You can’t reload the Hokie p. I’m a current student and am not allowed to put more money on it. I only have what I had left over last semester

Well I rescind my suggestion. That stinks. On the bright side, anyone without a meal plan will really hone their cooking skills I guess??

Merry white Christmas to all the Hokies out there!

I haven’t seen snow in years from going to school in Florida and bad luck. I’m a student at VCOM and the very SECOND I leave it snows lol

Beautiful, snowy, Burress never gets old. Thank you!

Enjoy it while you can folks, probably won’t get much snow here anymore

There’s really no other campus like it

We got about 4 inches of snow here

Of course when we all leave SMH

Thought I'd share a painting I did of Burruss Hall! :3

That looks so good. Looks like the palace you walk to after beating a video game. You’re so talented!

Love your style

What a wonderful painting! I love your use of color. All the foliage looks so lush.

That is beautiful! You are so talented.

gonna look at this when I miss vt this summer :)

Looks like scenes in pokemon sword&shield at first glance

Amazing picture!!! Only thing missing is a long line of busses blocking the view.

Nice layout and good job!

Lame Stadium Next?

thank you! :)

thank you so much!

Thank you! it looks more stylized than the realism i was going for, but i'm pretty happy with it nonetheless :)

Aw, thanks!

awesome! that was my intention by sharing it. people have already left campus and are probably already missing it lol

Thanks! hahahaha I was actually contemplating whether I should include cars, busses, flag poles, etc. XD

Thank you! :)

hahahaha I can't promise, but when I do get inspired and motivated I might do it! :3

Glad to hear! It's excellent work. I think what contributes the most to the "stylized" aesthetic is the comparatively smooth texture of Burruss compared to the textured foliage.

thanks! Oh, I made this when taking the Painting for Non-Majors class, and I just didn't have enough time to completely put textures on the building, hahahaha might have to finish it at some point idk

There's a painting class for non-majors? What's it called? Taking it would be so fun!

Yes! It's literally called "Painting for Non-Majors". It's so much fun! I recommend it. There are also Drawing for Non-Majors and Photography for Non-Majors (and Sculpting? i'm not too sure)

Haha, all 3 of them sound pretty dope and would prove to be a major boost for the GPA! What's your major btw?

Oh definitely! I'm majoring in Environmental Conservation & Society, also minoring in Visual Arts & Society so I had to take a Non-Major Art course

Ohh wow, that's definitely very creative, does that major fall under the College of Arts and Science or more towards the law side?

it's under the College of Natural Resources and Environment. it's a pretty interdisciplinary and versatile field/major so that's why I chose it (it can be about education, law, outreach, etc.) I still don't know what I wanna do tho lol

Before the dark times pt. 16

Y'all never just pulled into the lot and ghost rode that mf while you ran in and tried to get your meal before your car crashed? You can't get a parking ticket if your car isn't parked

Having to take the extra long bus ride from my apartment to campus because I don't want to pay parking fees just so I don't waste my dining dollars that expire in a few weeks😌😌

Who else sang this? 😂

the guys in safety vests using iPads in the Owens lot are not your friends

I work downtown.. ticket assholes start at 9am.... walked outside at 9:07.. yellow ticket go burrr

Pay the meter in the bookstore lot, walk over and pick up your food, then return to your car and leave. No ticket.

This is how I found out that the drillfield didn't open up at 5pm like the rest of campus. You kinda have to give them credit at being so ludicrously fast at ticketing people

Awful banter

Convenient of you to post this the day I do a double circle of the parking lot to check for a parking douche, grab a spot for less than 2 minutes as I pick up a Grubhub order, and find a ticket on my windshield with no douche in sight.

This is literally how I got a ticket like a month ago. I was picking up chicken parm from owens, it wasn’t after failing a test though

Yeah next level is putting it in first gear so it moves 😂. Y'all know you can put a quarter in at the library lot and walk like 200 feet to hokie grill right?

I’m bulk buying food rn, Chick-fil-A can I get 3 30 ct nuggets and leaf and ladle salads to survive me a week at a time

I used to work at Joes Diner and the same happened to me. I made it to the courthouse within 10 minutes of the ticket being issued and the clerk just laughed and tore it up.

Assuming you can find a spot...

I am simply a conveyor of relevant public frustration :)

Big brain. I might have to start doing that...

I'm a sophomore off campus- off campus fellas don't have their dining dollars carry over to next semester(like dec 16) so a few weeks is a bit of an exaggeration

Yea those dudes are clowns .. cellar guy here... the parking guys havnt changed one bit

There's virtually always a spot in that lot, only problem is that a quarter gets you a whopping 4 minutes

Here I go buying 850 nuggets I guess

How do you get the tray from there btw?/can you not order off grubhub?

Now I might just be an old fart (graduated in May) but when I was there I could NEVER find a spot in that lot around the times I'd try to go pick up food

If you're just picking food up, it shouldn't really take longer than that walking to and from Owens.

Np you won't have to worry abt it for a while

No one is shopping at the bookstore right now.

Is with the discount?

I think you're missing the point of this series of memes

Would be better if you’d ask me how I’m feeling. Anyway, this was a response that people can’t find an open parking space at the bookstore lot, which is ridiculous since that lot is wide open all day and night.

Shit I don't have enough left for antray :(((

What does that mean for us?

Sic semper tyrannis

Right to free speech and free assembly much?

It’s like watching Professor Umbridge get all those signs hung in Hogwarts. Like oh boy what are we banning today!

Straight nonsense. "Illegal protests"? This will not affect us at all, just another one of his claims to rile up the sheep while actually doing nothing. "Sent back to the country they came from". This tweet or truth is pretty stupid lol.

That Mango Mussolini is a wannabe fascist who will try to violate both our right to free speech and our right to freedom of assembly.

What it means is T-Bag hates protesters and you should do it as hard as you can.

Come and take it.

I’ve been told (by a parent I work with from their kid that) ICE showed up at UVA related to foreign students protesting. Cannot confirm but that is tracking with what this is saying. This is to stop dissent. It’s illegal because it was declared illegal by the king. And it’s not illegal for the king to overrule the constitution that thanks to the Supreme Court abdicating power and responsibility. Keep up y’all.

It means your president is a dumbass.

Fascism is Fascisming. Time to step up protests. Time to be louder.

A tweet is not law, and the insecure little senile old man words don't mean shit. We all need to tell our representatives to act NOW.

Issuing commands like this via twitter. Wtf.

Prediction: he's about to do some (more) stuff that will make college students very upset

https://preview.redd.it/gi6bpgzgvome1.jpeg?width=1079&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=84383897adfd5d8e216d6521a188a4058c5963c5 Most likely nothing really. I’ve yet to see an illegal protest here on my own time, and there’s no reason to draw attention to VT when the school is generally pretty relaxed.

It’s called fascism.

It means students need to protest their asses off! Don't accept autocracy!!

“…and depending on the crime, arrested.” That means regular police or national guard will be on your campus. Or even military, since he’s been clear he doesn’t oppose using military against Americans. Read about the Kent State massacre. And remember, just like the brutal police response to BLM protests around the country, they will blame the violence on protestors. This is from a BBC article about the kids killed at Kent State. https://preview.redd.it/pka5b6r3wpme1.jpeg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=598cca5e7ef2b46459c17d864e064e63c256693a

Ordering students to behave has always worked out in the past. Oh wait.

But he pardon the people who stormed the Capitol

Nothing. It's unconstitutional

Define “illegal protests” first

The problem is protest are popping up everywhere now. Well it’s a problem for Trump. After the protests at colleges like Columbia last year, they demonized them. Called them illegal. Said the universities were woke. This post from him is no surprise. I can see how they might send ICE agents to scare people. If they follow procedures for a legal protest, it shouldn’t be a problem. Go through the administration and campus police to get a permit. Definitely no camping! I suspect they will say something like for four hours, you can protest outside of Squires or on Henderson Lawn. I would go for the Drill Field, if they would allow it. I would imagine certain areas of campus might be off limits… like the memorials. Call tv stations to tell them you are protest but that would bring some unwanted attention too. They could also go to the town to protest on the edge of campus. The town has guidelines to make it legal. I would dot your i’s and cross your t’s for everyone’s sake. Meet with Blacksburg police. We protested when the Westboro Church came to town. The town gave the protestors certain areas to stand. The church had set up times for where they would be so it all went like clockwork and there were no issues. It was just symbolism for them anyway. I know the locals that are protesting in Christiansburg have met with the police department to make sure what they are doing is legal. They have set times and areas. There was a limit to how many could assemble (at first) but they have resolved this.

Simple: get a permit for your protest. All protests in America are legal so long as you abide by local requirements like not blocking rights of way or being on private property. The government can't expell people from schools lol.

Are we taking bets if Take Back the Night will be cancelled? My guess is Run for Rememberance might be on the chopping block too. At some point it's a display of power, which is really the only thing he and his supporters care about. It's not like they care about prosperity.... just look at the current stock market...

It means nothing it’s his bodies way of passing hot air that can’t get through his diaper

Nothing. It’s performative theatre for his sheep.

This will hold up only because the supreme court is stacked.

The situation at Barnard college likely explains this. Trump is very connected and identifies with New York City, and that's been a big story the last few days. They've had issues with protesters wearing masks coming in disrupting classes and so forth. For a long time, the faculty and administration were pretty tolerant of this and they've just recently started cracking down. I suspect he read a story about it and wanted to tweet about it.

It means that Tim Sands eats lightbulbs

Key word is 'allows' - there are some schools doing little or nothing to stop illegal protesting.

It means don't let idiots destroy your campus.

Surely this will be used fairly against masked fascists marching with swastika flags!

Lol he literally doesn't have the power to do any of that the dude is talking trash so the public vickers over it instead of seeing what he's going to try to do for his corporate buddies

So ironic coming from the architect of the Jan 6 riots.

Hopefully revolution.

If you guys stop because the baby said to do so you entirely miss the point of civil disobedience and protest

We have the right to protest; so keep going the courts will figure itnout

Don’t act a fool.

He's obviously talking about what has been happening on the campus at Columbia University. Students in masks were storming Classrooms while professors were teaching a Jewish Studies class and then refused to leave and assaulted some of the faculty and staff. Edit Spelling\*

It doesn’t mean a goddamned thing. He’s just typing.

posts like these make me concerned about my fellow voters and their lack of basic political knowledge. I'll make it simple. illegal protests are violent protests, the American public has a constitutional right to PEACEFULL protest without interfering with police or government officials. anything other than this is an illegal protest which VT does not condone in anyway. The "free Palestine" protest turned violent therefore police were called, and students were arrested. do not do this, you have the right to free speech and to make signs and block the sidewalk with whatever thing you believe in no matter how right or wrong you are, but the second you shove me out of the way or make me threatened you will have consequences because that turns violent. this does not impede your right to free speech, this is not "tyrannical" this is just saying "hey if you do the thing you aren't supposed to be doing anyway, you will actually have consequences" please stop pretending that because something is said by trump that it is bad

The party claiming for free speech and open debate sure is doing a lot to squash free speech and open debate

If you protest the gestapo may come for you. I'm protesting.

Free speech is not an unlimited right. Actions have consequences. That's all this means.

The "thank you for your attention to this matter" really gets me like it's not some random social media post

When I went to Tech in the late 2000s, the student body seemed to lean more conservative than democratic. What is it like today? And what do republican Hokies think about all this?

Pay attention to what's ahead, that led him to post this. That's the real headline.

When was Right to free speech and free assembly illegal?

Not a VT student but why don’t we just protest against everything going on. If they arrest us then boom lawsuits galore.

This reads like one of those clearly fake tweets spread by satirical fake news websites. But it’s real. Funny stuff

Don’t worry bro I’ll get a third one ready for you in a week or so

Oh hey I just found out I need one of those! Sure is lucky we ran across each other.

Lmao, didn’t someone get robbed of a converter recently?? Edit: oh it’s a meme 🤣🤣🤣

Sure do, hope to have a third soon!

I can get two for you, but I’ll need to sell you the first one and then after about a week, I can get the second one for you. If you need another one at that point, it’ll be another week.

Awesome!! Meet me here: 200 Clay St SW, Blacksburg, VA 24060

50,000 people used to live here... now it’s a ghost town.

Campus is surreal. Absolutely deserted, except for empty buses driving around.

All ghillied up baby

I had to run in to the office yesterday to get something, and drove through campus. It was eerie. My summer commute is one thing...less students, less traffic, but this was like campus was deserted. I guess it means we're doing what we're supposed to!

I'm actually kinda impressed that a lot of people recognized this reference, considering that freshmen were like 5-7 years old when this came out.

It's like being here in Summer not too weird...

The number of people who didn’t get this is very surprising.

I hate to say it but I love it when all you fuckers leave because Blacksburg is so nice in the summer and during winter break.

Where is this 50,000 number coming from?

I graduated already, To a certain extent the students and townies are always pretty separated / socially distant (with exceptions obviously) I hope everything is going okay down there & people are quarantined up. Blacksburg would be an awful place for an outbreak. “Lowkey highkey” soooo many senior citizens that live in & around Blacksburg

I am alumni in China and never saw this before, it should be beautiful when nobody is in town. Hope everyone is safe in now.

Yeah it’s nuts. We miss you guys. Stay safe, Hokies!!!

I’ve never seen anything like it.

It's kinda beautiful

At least it's a very pretty ghost town

Do the foreign exchange students leave too?

It pains me to know that I'm old enough to get the reference. I guess you could say its time to go hunting, whadya say Capt. Price?

Most people are still living here. Just aren’t outside lol....

Yeah, I live about an hour away and I was thinking about just shopping I'm Blacksburg because the store to person ratio is super high. There's like noone in the store so I'd be much less likely to contract COVID-19.

just reopen the school already. this whole thing is so silly

The mechanisms of old continue to roam, having outlasted their departed creators.

i havent left my house in a month, are there less people than summer?

I felt the same way on Tuesday when I went to get some stuff from my office :O

Remastered version + a lot of us played as teens anyways

nah it’s so much more empty than summer. drive around on a weekend night, it’s desolate

summer is so boring lmao

It's kinda funny. I think someone posted the link in another comment for educational purposes

Username leads to suspicions

Seems like hardly any students leave during the summers these days. I know that's an exaggeration but you really should've seen what it used to be like when nobody wanted to stay here.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRYmVb33VU0

It's so fun to watch all these people arguing about 50k when it's just a CoD reference

Probably the schools enrollment numbers

There’s approximately 6% of on campus students still here.

not most but more than people think

Please don’t come here to shop tho

>I'd be much less likely to contract COVID-19. That's making a huge assumption that you're not already an asymptomatic carrier.

That sounds like it came out of Stephen King's dark tower series.

"There Will Come Soft Rains"?

That sounds like a fallout quote

I agree. Summer brings construction projects and road improvements to life, and there’s a flurry of summer camps and summer orientation activities. This? This is surreal.

Ohhhhh thanks!

I never played Call of Duty so I don't know why I would be expected to know the reference. Nobody's arguing anyway, it was a simple question.

~36,000 != 50,000

I’m willing to bet off campus numbers are decently high compared to what people think as well.

Are you guys excluding townies from this? Lol because there’s thousands of them

I thought the same thing.

Great to be back on campus this year!

I've always found that whole thing bizarre. Churches in rural areas like this usually don't have a ton of money and they're spending it on this. But here's the thing: 1. If you are Christian and actively practicing, you probably already have a Bible. 2. If you aren't Christian or actively practicing, you're not going to want a Bible. So what's the goal here?

Pro tip: walk around campus wearing a set of large over-ear headphones. No one will try to talk to you or hand you shit. At least it seemed to work with my Sennheisers.

I graduated back in 2010 and this happened every time we walked across the Drill Field. Learned quickly just to say “Jew” as they approach.

Print out a pamphlet of your own and hand it back to them

just happened to me like 5 minutes ago.

just ran into the dudes handing out the New Testament outside of Turner lol

If you're a member of the corps of cadets, you could consider this approach: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4CizzE-zZo

I just said yes and grabbed one because I'm not good put on the spot lmao.

lol yeah theres like 40 of em I took one at 9 am and from then on basically have been holding it up to all these guys as I pass by lol

So that’s what that is?

Cant wait for my free award bc im 100% coming back for this post

This post was way funnier than it should’ve been 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

To them if they get someone to even open the page of a bible that’s a win as there’s potential they might adopt the Christian faith. Bibles are relatively cheap and there are multiple organizations that will provide and hand out bibles for churches and programs that you see on campus. Hell it’s why there are bibles in almost all hotel rooms. Cost is a non issue when it comes to bibles

Make it feel like you’re doing something

A Christian friend of mine was converted following a similar effort. Just because it doesn't work often doesn't mean that it never works. If you consider the stakes to be very high (souls, eternity, etc.) then playing a low-percentage game like this isn't so unreasonable. Also, regarding funding: (1) I don't think this effort is funded locally and (2) churches with a lot of professors and other professionals are funded pretty well. This might sound lame, but you should just ask your questions to these guys. They are there because they care for you (albeit maybe not in a way that you agree with) and they want to talk to you. I'd suspect they'd be happy to answer.

It can just be a sheet of paper with a QR code that links you to [this WikiHow article](https://www.wikihow.com/Stop-People-From-Trying-to-Convert-You-to-Another-Religion).

Airplane! is a gem

>Bibles are relatively cheap This especially is true. I remember as a kid my home church would hand out bibles but it was always like the small core new testament stuff regarding salvation (Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, Romans) in really thin bounded paper. To us it really just felt like getting them out there made us feel like we were making a difference I suppose though lol. Not sure the complete motive of handing them out to students on their way to class though.

I guess that makes sense considering there are Churches that are quite literally run like businesses. If local churches are part of a larger network (e.g. Catholic churches) they probably don't need to rely on their own funding.

Well, unfortunately, there's a 50/50 chance that if I go up and talk to them they're going to notice that I'm wearing gay pride pins on my backpack and I'd like to not get hate-crimed. Not saying that everyone who does things like this are going to be bigots, but it's a possibility and I'm not comfortable exposing myself to potential harassment. I know where the LGBTQ+ friendly churches/places of worship in the area are so if I wanted to I could visit them.

Most local churches are independent from a major church network. Not sure about any other branches of faith but usually there’s little to no overlap between a rural church in Appalachia and a Joel Oelstein style mega church. I’m at Radford and the only ones handing out bibles are either religious clubs on campus that are part of a national organization or a religious group themselves who travel campuses across the country

I think it's vanishingly unlikely that they're going to do anything like that, especially in public. It seems that you're stereotyping these people. I don't know them, so maybe you're right, but I still think it'd be better to be open minded about it.

I wasn't referring to mega-churches. A lot of churches tend to have "sister churches" in neighboring regions around the state, and they sometimes pool finances. The church my mother attends back in Richmond has sister churches in Alleghany and Hanover counties. I know that her church has done "donation drives" to fund various projects at those churches before.

I've been open minded about it in the past and it didn't go well. You'd be surprised at what people are willing to say to your face if they decide you're less than human.

Oof. I'm sorry to hear it. Hopefully you've had that type of interaction for the last time.

Appreciate the sentiment! There are way more spaces on campus that are affirming and inclusive than there were when I first got here so hopefully the climate continues to change for the better.

knock knock

Y’all forgot to add Alabama...Mfers got nearly 2000 cases in 2 weeks

For what it’s worth I’m genuinely sorry y’all in person people are getting screwed. At least I’ll see y’all in zoom university

Might want to update the meme.... ND dashboard... https://here.nd.edu/our-approach/dashboard/ ND also requires all but seniors to live on campus and has no greek life. They can test all day and clamp down hard on stupid. So they are likely to stay all year and be in very good shape relative to most universities their size.

How many people at these universities died due to Covid?

...and that’s why Blacksburg residents like it better in the summer when the undergraduates are gone...

Are you implying that people aged 18-22 are dying from Covid?

Screw this meme. We are gonna get thru this semester

Also I heard from VTPD/Blacksburg PD/School thay they don’t expect to close even w/ 1000 cases they expect to handle it accordingly so the snowflakes need to to stop yapping

> The cases are plateauing - nrv health director

I read this list from top to bottom and thought Montgomery was doing really well, then I looked at the dates...

I also think a lot of people don’t realize how small the student body at ND is because they still compete at high levels athletically. Their total undergrad is under 9k. VT undergrad is 27k.

This is the question we should be asking. So far what I’ve read is no va student has died from COVID yet and it’s very rare for college aged individuals to die from it without severe underlying conditions. Penn state is reporting 1 student fatality from “covid and other complications” and the CUNY schools of ny are claiming 38 deaths “within the system” but are not saying they are students.

Except for the fact that the majority of jobs wouldn’t exist in Blacksburg if not for the university. Summer Blacksburg has a definite charm but let’s not pretend the city would look anything like it does alone. It’s one of the most immeshed city/university combos there is.

This person doesn't speak for all of us. I like some of the benefits of the seasonal emptiness that might stem from their absence; but if I didn't like being around the students I wouldn't live here.

Off campus students are Blacksburg residents

Yeah, every year when the undergrads come back, they bring a viral disease with them.

I have to agree lol

As expected I guess

I mean they clearly are plateauing* *Just a curvy upward plateau....

Meanwhile, the school board is all "the health director says the cases are plateauing and the school system has no overlap with the colleges." 🤦‍♂️

I rotated my phone 90 degrees. This checks out!

We don’t know enough about the long term effects of catching and recovering from Covid-19 to be nonchalant about case numbers. You might beat it but then never be able to do strenuous exercise again due to reduced lung capacity. We just don’t have the data to know. Also students don’t live in a bubble. Cases rising in Montgomery county are primarily students right now, but students still grocery shop and eat at restaurants and get gas and interact with the greater Montgomery county as a whole in other ways. The cashier you use at Kroger could have an elderly person in their house. It very well could be that not a single Virginia Tech student dies from COVID-19. But I would be very surprised if the Montgomery county death toll does not also increase to a degree of statistical significance during the fall semester.

While COVID may not be as deadly to young adults, its not only young adults present on college campuses. That question does not account for everyone being exposed to COVID due to a university being open. Also ANY fatalities, students or faculty, as a result of universities opening is irresponsible. So not exactly sure why this is the question that we should be asking.

Oh yeah, and what about teachers faculty and other staff? How about the community around the students? Sure, maybe students dont die, but what about EVERYBODY ELSE? Smh.

But that's not the whole point. If you get covid you have failed to protect not only yourself but others. You are contributing to a global epidemic that is killing hundreds a day.

I see some of you didn’t like my post. It was meant to be humorous, I’m an alum myself. I just remember the sense of “oh no, they’re coming back” on the part of locals. COVID probably heightened that sentiment.

They’re using the “fuck it” strategy for outbreak control.

Can’t plateau if it doesn’t go up first. *Taps temple*

They plateau if you look sideways

The lifespan of people infected in early life during the Spanish Flu pandemic of 1918 was shorter than normal. [Paper here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3682600/)

Agreed. It’s just not a good idea for the universities to have put everyone in this situation in the first place. But hey, fixed costs are fixed costs I guess. Gotta get their money somehow.

Yes, the problem is the students will be fine, but having them all centralized at a university increases the infection rates for everyone else, creating a problem that was avoidable

Yeah. I’m an off-campus resident student. Lived here for 4 years now. It’s definitely nice having a quiet town every summer and during breaks. Less traffic, less noise, less lines, and now, less COVID cases.

Usually I just get a bit (well, a lot- move-in day last year made my 10-minute commute an hour and a half) annoyed by the increased traffic. This year it was almost a panic attack, because it was the first time I'd seen people in groups in five months.

This tactic is also known as The Swedish strategy, except it works worse in the US then it did in Sweden.

Unfortunately the economic impact to the greater community if VT didn’t resume classes would be *massive*. I would wager most of downtown could not survive without the student spending if there wasn’t a government stimulus or something. I really feel like the government could have done a lot more to provide support to people and small businesses during this.

probably because they don’t have to worry about going into financial ruin if they want to go visit the doctor.

Because so many Americans are obese and unhealthy unfortunately

Sweden is still doing far worse than its Nordic neighbors in cases and mortality. They on average they have healthier citizens than that of the US, but still the "screw it herd immunity strategy" is taking its toll. The elderly and the immunocompromised are the ones who suffering and dying at high rates. The US is a walking health crisis as it is, but let's let a pandemic that preys on people that are already sickly. Plus we have COVIDOTS that still believe it is a hoax and refuse to follow protective directives aka masks and social distancing.

Exactly. And even if VT paid all of its own employees what they would have made (which wouldn’t happen), all of the restaurants and shops downtown would have to lay-off employees if not shut down completely.

The government handing out trillions to their cronies while using the looming threat of economic extinction of small business owners and cascading impoverishment of working people as extortion to pry open the shops and force people back to work. The mob couldn't have done it better.

VMI and Virginia Tech cadets welcoming Queen Elizabeth II at the VA Capitol Building in 2007

Queen Elizabeth II visited Virginia in 2007 to commemorate the 400th Anniversary of the founding of Jamestown. She came to the Virginia Capitol Building to speak to the House and the Senate, accompanied by Governor Tim Kaine. Edit: Was also reminded that in 2007 she also visited survivors of April 16th: https://www.npr.org/2007/05/03/9981615/queen-elizabeths-trip-includes-visit-to-tech-victims

how did she look the exact same in 2007 as in 2022?????

Woah this is really cool, never knew! RIP her majesty 🙏

What an incredible picture. I was in grad school then, and don't remember this...how is that possible. What a stressful time.

Rip queen lol

Oh, I remember that day, it was one of the worst traffic jams I have ever been stuck in. They completely shut down I-64 for her motorcade to drive from Richmond to Williamsburg. I, am a descendant of a revolutionary soldier who was at Valley Forge with George Washington and my coworker who was in the car with me that day is a descendant of Benjamin Harrison V who signed the Declaration of Independence. We asked someone what was the cause of the massive traffic backup, (assuming there was a huge crash) and they said: "Oh haven't you heard the queen of England is in town." My coworker turned to me and said: "Damn, I thought our ancestors got rid of them back in 1776." LOL

Didnt she just croak

I never heard that she visited the 2007 survivors. Good to know

Didn't want to pay tons of money for a panoramic print of Lane Stadium... So I took my own

HOLY MOLY. This pic was so high quality I could pick myself out from the north endzone

And it came out great, would you share full quality original?

2 or 3 pane panorama? Fish eye lens?

Lmao I can zoom in and see myself as a little orange blob in the student section. Fantastic photo man!

i can literally see myself in south endzone… crazy photo 🔥

Would really appreciate it if we stopped posting pictures of where I vomited every Saturday. Thanks.

Nice photo!

I sure wish we could win these games...we are 0-2 for stripped games.

When was this photo taken?

Great photo! What camera did you use? Is it the A7riii/iv? Would explain the high pixel count.

Did you flip the midfield logo?

Fantastic photo! Let us know if you’d be willing to share. I have 2 Hokie graduates that would love a copy!

Wish I could give you more than an upvote. I love that it's from the student side!

Seriously beautiful! I miss that place so much. Your photo puts me back at home.

Awesome picture. But I’m confused. Why are the people to the right the same as the people to the left? Not a true picture?

Man this is awesome! Good work!

Yeah this is a pretty large photo lol, but what’s posted is pretty high quality already. You could zoom for days and not lose any quality!

This image as it's posted is ~75 megapixels, even if this isn't the original you don't need any bigger. This image can be printed at 53" wide at 300ppi.

3 photos stitched together!

Thank you so much!

Thanks I appreciate it!

It was taken this year at the Notre Dame game!

Haha you nailed it! It’s the A7r iv 😉

„¿oƃol plǝıɟpıɯ ǝɥʇ dılɟ noʎ pı◖„

I did! I didn’t like how it looked with it facing the other way, so I just did a quick photoshop job!

Feel free to just click on the photo and download! It’s a pretty high res photo that’s uploaded

I took the photo and then photoshopped the VT to flip it around lol, that’s it

Thank you! I know I feel like all the photos you see are from the other side, when I personally think this photo is much nicer!

I’m glad that my photo gives you those feelings, it truly makes me happy ❤️ I feel the same way looking at it, I can’t wait to get this thing framed and have it hanging on my wall

Shhh…. The original had a guys big hand and phone in the way and I hated the way it looked, so I used the clone tool in photoshop to get rid of it 😅 it is a true photograph though! Just manipulated a bit to look a little bit better in my opinion

Sorry, Reddit mobile just deciding I wasn’t worthy of seeing full quality

Right on! Great pano!

Great stuff! What lens?

Gorgeous photo, and thank you so much for your generosity in freely sharing your work.

The moment it all started!

I got stuck in this snow ball fight one time when I had to deliver my final term paper to a building across the drill field. I didn't even have it in a folder so I had to dodge snow balls and protect my paper with my life to get it in on time. I managed to make it across just fine! On my way back to my dorm I wasn't so lucky...

War. War never changes

Did anyone get the “Fuck UVA” chant on video?

Was this today?

What is going on? I'm sorry I'm ignorant on this lol, I don't come into VT until the fall session due to some classes I gotta finish up.

I never got a snowball fight in the 2.5 years I was there.

I'm glad this tradition remained

I left around 2. We had the cadets on the ropes, but they countercharged!

The moment the covid outbreak on campus started

Got a video myself of us all around the giant snowball chanting screw uva it was tons of fun.

Ah yes, very socially distanced.

I remember doing this when I was a student and the ROTC guys had guilli suits

Sneeze on the snowball and turn that bitch into biological warfare

Fabulous time, glad I could finally make it

Every single person who is there should be put on academic probation. A huge breach of COVID safety regulations and actively endangering the entire Blacksburg community. Shameful. For all the people who keep saying "BuT pEoPlE wOrE mAsKs", in every single video I've seen tons of people who were wearing their face coverings improperly or not wearing one at all. This was monumentally stupid and I can only hope that the only people who suffer for this are the ones who went, although I know that won't be the case.

More footage [here](https://imgur.com/a/PMrxviH)

I’m really glad there was still a snowball fight this year. It was a great time and from what I saw people did a pretty good job wearing their masks. Also, I don’t know who Batman was, but you were awesome dude.

2007 we stole an ROTC flag and drove it around in a 4 wheeler. Great fun.

Fucking epic

Jfc. At the height of the pandemic? I hope people were wearing masks at least

But...but...but... Covid....

was very fun

I am absolutely so disappointed in the community. There is a GLOBAL PANDEMIC. Yes sorry you have to give up some things to protect the lives of others. Imagine being a teacher and seeing this video then having to go teach these folks in person and at the end of your day go home to your wife and kids. Good god. The selfishness of some in this community is truly astounding. UT prosim indeed fellas. What a joke. Edit: The fact this is a controversial comment proves my point. If this is what the Tech community represents then I am ashamed to call myself a Hokie.

Man! I wish I could have been there

Biowarfare colorized

Love this because my friends who run a food pantry in the area there just got a massive outbreak of COVID that has decimated their core team and made it impossible for them to run for a couple of weeks. But it looks like you guys are having fun with your little snowball fight. Would be too horrible for you to make the sacrifice of not having it this year so maybe some people won't have to go hungry, or die! Oh well :)

Wish I was there instead of florida!!

That exchange of air could also happen at Kroger, the ATM, in a doorway with a rush between classes, in the dorm, the lunch table because no one knew of their exposure.....unfortunately we would have to never live, work, or go out at all to avoid it completely, and then of course- you'd never reach herd immunity.

Wow so this is why we’re still dealing with this pandemic. No clue how these guys made it into college in the first place doing something with utter disregard for human life

Let’s go Hokies!

It’s tradition, every year lol. There’s always some snowball fight. I never participated but it’s fun watching it on webcam.

Whether you know it or not, you were being filmed for your future biographical film

So sad I didn’t go

Yea, 1:00PM

Every year on the first substantial snow it's tradition for the cadets to have a snowball fight with the civilians

The past two years, we haven't really gotten a big enough snow in the spring semester.

You’re not wrong, but, to be fair, it was outside and almost everybody was masked up and except for the front line were pretty far apart, at least where I was.

Hey, did you go out and protest last summer?

i don’t think i’ve ever seen a more distanced crowd of people !

I’ll own up to it, what I saw on the live feed looked very distanced with like a 100 folks or so on the drill field, this is dumb.

The fact that you are getting downvoted makes me happy I am virtual this semester.

Is there an estimated number of people that participated?

It's outdoors- no one is standing still for 5-15 minutes, even if they were briefly too close without a mask, and let's face it- these guys are low risk and easier to get a test if needed. Give it a rest, Darren.

For all you numbnuts driving home in the next couple days, please review this image

But how am I supposed to police everyone's speed in the right lane?

I've seen people get pulled over for this twice and they were both glorious.

Left lane is for crime

Find a picture of an 18-wheeler going uphill in the left lane and we'll talk.

This is why you just drive at night, I leave BBurg (or NOVA for that matter) at like midnight and cruise at 70-85 mph all the way.

Haha yes, another driving post that wont affect anyone's driving

"No, I gotta go out and have fun at someone else's expense I drive really slow in the ultra fast lane While people behind me are going insane" - Denis Leary

Don't be any of the people in the left lane, the rest are all following dangerously close. Or maybe take the train/bus/carpool

But also please don’t be the tick tock who immediately whips into the right lane to pass, preventing said numb nut (or truck) from getting over.

i think this is impossible for people to comprehend

r/IdiotsInCars

Half the people who are doing that really believe they are doing the whole world a big favor by slowing people down. They are "Saving Gas" and "Keeping you safe". I have really heard people saying that before.

90 or nothin bby

I assume they’re foreign or just stupid. Yield to the right is common knowledge here in the US whether it’s highways or escalators. When I drive I at least frequently check my mirrors in case someone is riding my tail. The worst is when two semi trucks stay side by side for miles so nobody can pass them. Very common on I-81.

This shit is every. fucking. day. on 460, combined with the last minute jerk of the steering wheel to get off the Downtown exit from the left lane. Some of you guys need to learn how to drive.

I think people need to realize that in many states it is literally illegal to drive in the left lane. It should be used for passing only. There would literally be no traffic if people just drove in the right lane

The left lane is for *passing* regardless of what speed you're going at. If a car or tractor trailer in front of me is doing less than my speed, I'm going to move into the left lane and pass them and I sure as hell am not speeding up because you want to be doing 80 in a 65. That's what happens to me the majority of the time when drivers get pissy about me being in the left lane. You can't tell anything about what speed the car in front is doing - they could be speeding themselves and passing slower traffic on the right, and they have every right to do that at whatever speed they're doing.

Or every single person behind them tailgating. Impatience is a really stupid reason to get in a car crash.

Relevant Family Guy: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqPpAmiZSNo

Amen! GTFO unless you're passing https://www.autoinsurance.org/keep-right-which-states-enforce-left-lane-passing-only/

True. But this doesn't give anyone license to cruise in the left lane just because they're going faster than the occasional person they pass in the right. Once you've passed whoever you need to pass, move back to the right. Left lane isn't for cruising. That rule applies whether you're going slower than others in the left lane or faster than those in the right.

If everyone can stop doing this on Prices Fork that would be an amazing start! Y'all make my northern city side wanna come out 🤣

We’re looking at you New Jersey.

No i will drive slow in the left lane. Tailgate me and ill go 25

Love the pic. That interstate down in Huntsville Alabama (with nearby Madison) everybody goes about 100 and those slow people cause accidents.

I guess nobody knew how to cut traffic 😂 I see ample space to get past this idiot.

Lots of travel between B'burg and Florida -- in addition to tailgaters the annoyance comes from drivers who micropass in the left lane (including and especially tractor trailers), stacking up traffic behind them. Once they move right, they speed up by several MPH and make it difficult to move back right because there isn't enough room or speed difference between them and the passed vehicle to create space.

Numbnuts is an insult I always appreciate.

I hate cars and drive as little as possible. But when I have to… :-)

My favorite is when I get into the left lane to pass, then all these people doing over 100 start stacking up behind me, tailgating, and trying to pass me in the right lane while I’m clearly passing (in this picture) that Chevy and the 18 wheeler. Left lane is for passing, not for traveling and being a dickhead, like all of these people tailgating are.

Funny to me that OP thinks he's in a position to offer instruction on lane discipline, when this post proves that he doesn't even understand it. You can't tell from the photo that the indicated vehicle is doing anything wrong. If the driver is *actively passing* in the left, in fact, they are using it correctly. What's even funnier is that, based on the line spacing, this is clearly an exit where the left lane exits one way, and the right the other. Are you supposed to not use the left lane even if you're exiting that way?

If they are going the speed limit, what is the justification. Not that I disagree, just curious as to the legal reasoning.

Drop a gear and disappear

It's for ppl with ticket money 🤣

They’re a problem too, doesn’t make you any less of a fucking idiot if you drive slow in the left lane

if they're passing then they're passing and that's what the lane is for. it sucks massively but they typically get back over when they can. it's far more rare to see a trucker oblivious to the rules of the road than some car just cruising with a line behind them.

Every time I've had that happen it's so they could pass another big rig or even another car in the right lane and they've merged back right.

this is the way for sure it makes 495 and 66 so much easier when it's like 3 am

Careful with that 85, anything above 80 in Virginia is considered reckless and can land ya in jail if you are unlucky with the cop

Though at this time of year, you need to be careful about deer running across the road. Use your highbeams as long as you can when driving at night.

I get home super fast when I drive at night it’s awesome. It sometimes gets ruined by late night construction but it happens

Fax i just left last night at midnight. Got to nova in 3hrs lol

But where would we be without without the wit and wisdom of these posters who, in their \~5 years experience behind the wheel, have demonstrated that they are the world's greatest drivers?

🎵 I'm an asshooooooooole! 🎵

These idiots are painfully unaware that they should be getting over usually

I give them about a mile then pass.

There are two separate laws: 1. Drive at or below the posted speed limit 2. When driving less than the normal speed of traffic, use the rightmost lane available for travel These laws are independent of each other, meaning you can be violating neither, both, or one of the two. Also, whether or not others are violating the law has absolutely no bearing on whether or not you're violating the law.

As soon as they've passed the people in the right lane they're supposed to get back over. Left lane is only for passing

Whoever yelled, “Fuck you, Asshole!” at the end of the first half. You’re my hero. I love you.

It was so crystal clear. Perfectly enunciated. It’s been a rough few weeks. Had a really good laugh.

the last minute or so was not ideal clock management, but overall, pretty good first half

I hope Fuente heard her. You could’ve replaced Fuente with a Bruegger’s Bagel and achieved the same amount of coaching.

Virginia tech legend

I’m trying to upload the video. Dunno if the mods will allow.

Bless that saint! 🙏

That was Trevor Lawrence

I hope it was directed at Fuente. He completely deserved it. Had 3 timeouts and a minute to at least go for a field goal. Nope. Didn’t even try until 2 seconds left.

This is seriously the best moment of the 2020 Hokie Football Season

Describes what I want to say to Fuente every Saturday 😂😂

I caught it too with my friends and we all agreed it's be on old row soon enough

That was hilarious. Top notch heckling.

Had it been a bad call, it might have even made sense.

I see Hokie spirit and unity is a thing of the past. Pathetic behavior from everyone involved. "Yeah this guy is a piece of shit because he didn't coach the sports game the way I wanted." Grow up.

I heard it ! Couldn’t believe a big deal wasn’t made about it!

Video with death yell included... https://imgur.com/gallery/gIg8WeG

Thank you so much for that!

I’m thrilled. It was fun to watch. I love football!!!!!!

Brueggers did nothing to deserve that comparison

We should get a new coach every two years like Tennessee so that we’re good like them.

Hokie hero?

Why not both?

Nobody is attacking Fuente's character... We don't think he's a piece of shit, we think he's a coach of shit. Virginia Tech pays him $4 Million per year, it's reasonable criticism.

Time for you to step down as "moderator"

Lighten up...The only reason he's even in Blacksburg is to coach that "sports game," and he gets paid millions to do it. I'm not gonna feel bad for him if he's failing at his job and fans complain and call for his firing.

A hug! My first! Thank you!

You know what, that’s fair. I think those bagels would probably manage a clock better. And also they’d give more energy to our players.

We should just get a new coach when one doesn’t work after 5 seasons and abysmal recruiting.

I took my friend to Owens for his birthday.

This is so wholesome

hey i saw this while i was working today! i was very curious as to what this was lol

Got a flashback to 1983. Looks the same! I can taste the roast rabbit, boiled okra, green jello and grape cool aide.

Need a gallon of chipotle ranch from the burrito place. It’s been years

Do they still have Scrod?

my heart is warm

Tso's I assume? Great taste.

This is adorable.

Awesome. That is all

Wow! Who’s that handsome devil in the White outfit? 🥰

Looks like you need to take him to McComas instead

We had a nice time :)

Oh nice! I wanted to do something for his birthday and we figured this hadn't been done before so we picked up a tablecloth and a fake candle from Walmart and made it a date.

Oh man, that sounds good! We got General Tso's chicken this time.

Oh man those quesadillas were good. Chicken, pico, corn, with the chipotle ranch was the shit.

Oooh, go for it!

They do not, I'm pretty sure they renovated Owens recently but I'm not sure.

You are absolutely correct! It's my go to for sure.

It made us feel cute.

My fiancée's grandmother is turning 100 today. Here is a picture of her tailgating in the early 80s. Season ticket holder since 1952 !

This is awesome!!!

Look at all those big beautiful trees around Lane

That’s amazing!! Happy Birthday Grandma!

Guy in the hat looks Hokie to the bone.❤️

Very possible I was at that game and in that very parking lot. I remember the pine trees in the south end zone and gravel parking lots. Good times running around those trees as a kid... Happy Birthday Grandma! Go Hokies!

Goals right there

Interesting how it was mostly cars back then and now you mostly see trucks.

So many more years of holding season tickets before getting even close to that.

Is that from where the baseball field is now?

Wow. Thats awesome.

That table almost looked like it was floating

Yeeaaah. To be fair i bet capacity was half what it is today back then. Tradeoffs.

Nope, it's Lane right after they expand the east stand I believe. North and South end zones aren't built yet.

It's a foldable table! Supported by the seats.

To me it feels slightly too far west in relation to the stands to be in the modern south lot

Like on the other side of Beamer Way in the modern Lot 4

You are right, just realized how far back that is. The road that cut across it probably wasn't even there than.

Made a 3D map of the Blacksburg area!

Merry Christmas! Map made using an old USGS map and height data from the USGS 3DEP package. I basically got a height map using QGIS, and then combined the two in Blender. *EDIT*: If you'd like to use the data I used or play with the Blender / QGIS projects, you can find them [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Q4hmOEQ5adASw1wqvVdTPBUh-apU78vL?usp=sharing).

Yo this is slick. Basemap from Stewart’s class?

Oh wow the highway isn't even on there.

r/nextfuckinglevel

Do you have an STL? Would love to print this

A few interesting things here: the hospital isn't there (built in 71, TIL!), Christiansburg Institute is included here which is awesome considering how much Christiansburg has tried to get rid of that history.

Just barely got Brush mtn on there haha looks awesome!

Would you mind sharing that height map?

What is the material? How did you make it 3d?

Thanks! I haven't taken Stewart's class (I'm a CpE, but I just think maps are really cool). My basemap is taken from [here](https://ngmdb.usgs.gov/topoview/viewer/#11/37.1387/-80.4776).

That map is pretty old. Lane is there but Pritchard isn't - that puts it in the 60s at some point, I think?

If you generate an STL, can you reply here or share it to this reddit? Making one is beyond my skills but I'd love to print a copy if you do it.

Unfortunately, I don't. I can try to work on one, though. I did this by applying a height map to a mesh in Blender, so I never had to work with an STL directly. *EDIT:* If you want to give it a go, I have placed a link in my top-level comment to an archive with all the files I used.

[Sure!](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UtLaWGOeeYYqwfl18byb_zH_hpGApuoW/view?usp=sharing) I don't think it's georeferenced since it's a .png, but I got the height data from [here](https://viewer.nationalmap.gov/basic/#/). You can open the result in QGIS (a free GIS program) and make a similar one for whatever area you like. *EDIT:* All my files are at the link posted in the top-level comment.

In Blender, I just made a plane with the map texture and then applied a height map texture as the displacement to generate the 3D hills and valleys. You can see it in the .blend file in the archive I linked in my top level comment.

I’m impressed. The USGS topo viewer is a great resource! And not many people know about the potential of topographic visualization through modeling programs like blender.

Well I was gonna (jokingly) complain that you decided to cut my house juuuuust off the left edge, but evidently I need to lodge my complaint with the government instead.

If you look on the bottom right, I believe the map is from 1965.

Awesome, thank you!! Merry Christmas!

Bhayshul Tuten runs the 40-yard dash in 4.32 seconds, the fastest time of any running back at the NFL Combine 0.06 seconds faster than the next closest competition. Also leads all RBs in the vertical jump with 40.5. Wildly impressive showing.

Can’t edit the post but I’d also like to add: this is the fourth fastest 40-yard dash time by a running-back ever. - 1 - Chris Johnson (4.24) - 2 - Dri Archer (4.26) - 3 - Keith Marshall (4.31) - T4 - Bhayshul Tuten & De’Von Achane (4.32) https://www.on3.com/pro/news/fastest-40-yard-dash-times-nfl-combine-history-top-10-running-backs/

Rootin' for Tuten!!

Commanders taking notice

Dont care what team he goes to I will be getting his jersey

Oddly, David Spade had just joined Rich Eisen when Tuten was running- [Here's the video](https://www.tiktok.com/@nflonfox/video/7476917964692819242?is_from_webapp=1&sender_device=pc) EDIT- Listen for the HOKIE chant at the end!

. 4th fastest RB time ever. The stats I saw had him fist in 10yd, 40yd, vertical leap. And second in broad jump. Edited to remove erroneous stat

He’s one of the best RB’s in the draft. He played behind a very mediocre offensive line. As a junior, he lead the country in missed tackles. He will be the steal of the draft unless someone starts looking at his film.

Low key wonder if he could find his way to Seattle 👀

Jaylin Lane balled out too

Even though we're fairly set at RB, I wouldn't mind seeing him in Green Bay...

Would love to see him to the panthers in the 4th or 5th

On the TuteTrain this fantasy season

Ironically I’m afraid this performance is going to make some other team take him before the Commanders can with their 5th 😔 edit: nevermind, Commies just traded their 5th for Deebo Samuel

One of my favorite running backs that I can remember. I was glad they let him break the single game rushing record

where your jag jersey at?

Chris Johnson ran a 4.24 in 08 Achane also ran a 4.32 just a couple years ago.

For real that man was lightning

lol Tech isn’t set at any position, the program will never be competitive at a high level again

Speed for RBs can be overrated, but this definitely puts him on teams' radars.

The team is looking to trade Allen though, might be able to move one of later picks up to the 4th

Yeah. Bad source

I was talking about the Packers (my NFL team) being set at RB, but me wanting them to draft Tuten anyway.

check my edit on that comment holy shit lmao, i’m in shock rn

Still crazy fast and incredible!

Ohhhhhhh. My bad

WE GOT DEEBOOOOOO

Absolute cinema

What a game. Coach Montgomery getting emotional at the end was the cherry on top

Philip Montgomery now has more wins in one-score games than Brent Pry did.

Great game I was apoplectic when the refs called that roughing the QB on us late in the 4th quarter. Didn’t think we would be able to overcome that call

We were in the stands wondering what we missed for the flag to get thrown. Still wondering 😂

He’s absolutely earned it. Pry would have never ran those field goal attempts. The sideline looked absolutely energized. I’m happy he’s with us rn.

Refs calling a penalty on the cleanest sack you've ever seen while the QB never even tried to throw the ball was just criminal. I guess the defense is just supposed to politely ask the QB to get down on the ground?

On GameDay the next morning, Desmond Howard said, "Virginia Tech beat Cal and the officials."

I yelled, "it's not flag football!!"

This is like the second false report of Otter Sandman’s death in the past week, people need to relax.

If otter dies, how will tech continue make shitty covid analogies involving him?

There's more than one otter

I found a dead otter in the pond last semester, otter sandman is the family of otters in the pond. At least 1 of them dies every year

Doesn’t mean we can’t mourn

Not surprising since they are the apex predator and the "pond" is a biohazard.

Ay ee ay ee ay, everybody hates Mcbryde. A ceiling tile just fell from the freaking sky.

Hey, a large piece of the ceiling just fell down, let me go and stand directly under that spot!

But the important question: Did the professor cancel the class?

Nothing but the best Clark.

I could’ve easily survived that

Something clearly was being done above it, you can see what appears to be an impact or flash at the point of when it came thru the upper tile. If not anyone above working then it just broke loose a good amount of feet over that lower ceiling to break thru that lower area. Sometimes things just happen and break.

I don't think I've seen a campus building that has wood framing. Everything I've seen is steel and concrete. It looks like it was a decorative ceiling panel

Architect here. That most likely wasn’t framing, buildings of this size are built with steel and metal studs. Also drywall isn’t strong, it won’t catch a falling object. It could’ve been blocking- basically a block of wood tied to the structure that can be used to hang something from. Or more likely a decorative panel. If the structure is failing there would be signs that you would look for elsewhere (floors being uneven, walls sagging). That all being said what happened was that piece of wood probably wasn’t installed correctly to begin with.

I mean, that's the one spot where there is no plank that could fall

He didn’t 😭

Proud of you

Built different 😈💯

Was in the classroom at the time, can confirm that’s what it sounded like

Well, but statistically speaking the next one to fall is probably going to be really close to that.

I thought Ghetto Kroger was bad 😭😭

Ghetto Kroger is not that bad. It is less sketchy than the Food Lion up there. It is just not as nice as the Gucci one.

Sorry, old alum here. So is ghetto Kroger the one at Gables and Gucci Kroger the one at University Mall?

I'm 90% sure when I was in Atlanta this past spring I went to this new one and it had a little creepy vibe in the parking lot but was pretty nice inside

I lived two blocks away from Murder Kroger right before I moved to Blacksburg for grad school.

“I thought Ghetto Kroger was bad”…. I know it’s a joke. But Ghetto Kroger is only referred to that cause it’s old and ugly inside and out. Nothing else about it is even comparable.

I can say I've lived near both. Yay?

Grew up in Atlanta. They tore this Kroger down and rebuilt it. Still, it's referred to as Murder Kroger.

Fun fact - Kroger desperately wants to expand the UCB Kroger, but can't. They even offered to buy the postal service a big parcel on the other side of 460 and buy the current post office site, but no dice.

As a Hokie and Atlantian, Murder Kroger is a wild place. Much worse than ghetto Kroger!

We have a murder Kroger in RVA!

Hey that’s a mile from my apartment!

lol anyone calling anything in Blacksburg ghetto hasn’t been somewhere ghetto. It’s only called ghetto because the other one is called gucci, it’s not bc it’s sketchy at all 😂 there’s nothing sketchy in Blacksburg

yeah we also have that one Kroger that two women robbed and appeared on America’s Moat Wanted

There’s also a Murder Publix not too far away from Murder Kroger. No joke.

See also Disco Kroger that used to be in Atlanta opened in 1976 as one of the first 24-hour Krogers in town. In 1980, it got a new neighbor in the glitzy Limelight discotheque. Coked-up revelers wearing polyester shirts and bell bottoms could often be seen stumbling through the grocery aisles after hours, giving birth to the sobriquet “Disco Kroger”—a name that stuck.

Y’all better stop maligning my boy “good boy” Kroger with this unjustifiable hatred

I used to love that Kroger! Now it’s all “fancy”…

Not sure what it is with Atlanta and Krogers. We've got the murder kroger and the disco kroger. Even through the buildings have been demolished, the name remains

Can confirm murder Kroger is by far worse than ghetto Kroger as someone who moved to Atlanta after graduation 😂

wait till u hear about the race trac gas station at downtown atlanta gsu campus

Not to be confused with Disco Kroger (also in Atlanta)

Very interesting ... I graduated in 1979 and lived in a townhouse development called Sturbridge Square I think, and we walked across a vacant lot at all times and in all weather to the 24 hr Kroger (I think this Gucci Kroger) and bought things like Old Milwaukee for $2.99 a 12-pack! Now in an Atlanta suburb, have Kroger and Publix nearby, but shop at Aldi's (much better prices).

Yeah UCB kroger is ~fine -- it's the food lions that are wack

Ghetto Kroger has a better meat selection than Gucci Kroger. Everything else.... maybe not.

I went to VCU and my sister went to Tech. I found it so hilarious that y’all have a Ghetto Kroger too. Our ghetto Kroger really earned its name. Yalls is a paradise in comparison.

Don’t hate on our food lion! Affordable af

Ghetto Kroger is the one at university mall

They built a new one over near the First and Main complex is. Across from what I believe was a hardees now it is a cookout

It’s on the Beltline walking path right across from Ponce City market. It’s actually pretty popular today. It has an outdoor patio/bar with TVs and drinks much cheaper than a normal bar.

did you get murdered

wow stay safe 🥺🥺🥺

Hey now, we call it the Lombardy Kroger in polite conversation.

It’s gone now too, a Publix has risen in its place

They're all fine. The only difference between the different stores is the proportion of students: locals. The more students, the more people buying beer after ten. That's it.

My friends and I call those Food Lions the “Shitty Kitty”

I’m from Richmond and have been going to that Kroger my whole life. When I saw the “ghetto” Kroger at VT I was like this is nice what are they talking about. They don’t even have an armed security guard 😂

Out here in Christiansburg we have the Jim Kroger.

If that's the "ghetto kroger", yall better not ever go to roanoke. Valley View Walmart might cause you to have a seizure

Isn’t this the one by the math emporium that like 90% of students would go to?

The implied chronology of this comment is wild lol The Kroger you described is the Gables Kroger (in the Gables Shopping Center), but this predates the existence of First & Main by a lot a lot

Oh what, THAT is murder Kroger? Been there a lot and it always felt like a pretty nice one.

Well, I did say I moved to Blacksburg, so…

Hahahaha fair

Even the Food Lions are nice imo. The food lions where I’m from are more like “foo lyin”

At least from 2004-2016 stretching from when my siblings and i were in Blacksburg, the hethwood food lion was notorious for having spoiled produce and expired dairy still out on the shelves 🤷‍♂️

There’s nothing wrong with the UCB Kroger, but Gucci Kroger has beer on tap in the store and is at least 150% bigger

That's correct. It's a fine store, just not as fancy as Gucci Kroger. Also math emporium is gone.

I couldn't remember the name of the area , they were working developing the first and Main when I graduated so that is still fresh to my mind. I mentioned the hardees cause I think it was build there in the late 80's which based on the user name might be a touchstone for them.

It's nice now. But 5 years ago it was literally the dirtiest, most uncared for grocery store you can imagine. Multiple dead bodies were found in the parking lot over the years hence its name. Now it's gentrified to all hell.

Gonna post this in advance

Before the dark times: Thursday Hype Edition

I miss lane

The best is at the end of the second quarter when the band is filtering down onto the field when you get groups of rowdy bois singing the band part to lead those around them in the H O K I E S HOKIES part

Just know that the band is still playing this every first down :) we miss the fans and the student section

This is kinda meh

Why did they make you guys play in the baseball stadium? Surely there was enough room in the student section to social distance the band...

Sometimes your biggest fans are your harshest critics :)

It's less about social distancing and more about state regulations. Virginia has a 1000-person max on events, which is tough when there are almost 400 band members.

I'm not sure exactly. But I think less people in the football stadium definitely at least helps focus on keeping everyone there safer. Plus big groups trying to squeeze in and out of th smaller entrances isn't great. We're all hoping to be allowed back in the stadium soon though :)

Ah yes. Gen X. You mean the ones who had everything handed to them by the Greatest/Boomers and lived off the money of their fathers.

You wanna insult me based on what you think my generation is and it’s respective stereotypes, go ahead. Two can play that game, kid. And who’s the one who started whining? Who’s the one asking for praise for “paying the bill?” Who’s the one all triggered about this? All I did was call you out on your shit. Don’t share your opinion if you’re not prepared to defend it without being a child. Anyways, done being petty for now. But don’t call people entitled in such an entitled tone. The hypocrisy is a bad look for someone of your... stately age.

Psst: as a fellow GenXer, we're supposed to sit here and just say "meh" when they get like this. Never forget our motto: "Whatever." Just stay quiet and safe, we'll figure out what's going on later like we always have. Sincerely, Someone who remembers the election of Jimmy Carter

Pry relieved effective immediately. Philip Montgomery to serve in interim

My question is why Babcock, the man who brought us Fuentes and Pry, still around and why is he part of the next Head Coach search?

Anyone know any realtors in Blacksburg? Asking for a friend. Sincerely, W. Babcock

I think this is the right choice, but I do respect his press conference yesterday. Anyone who can have accountability like that, is someone with great character. I wish him the best and hope he can learn from these mistakes and get another chance, just not with VT.

Nice, lets get to work

I liked Pry a whole lot better than Fuente. Seemed like a more humble, all around better dude who actually wanted to be there. But yeah the performance just isn’t there. I was happy when Fuente got fired, now I’m just wary of the next guy.

Wish JC could have been interim coach again he did well in 2021 and the guys liked him

Funny, Pry is relieved immediately but I’m not relieved and remain skeptical.

Bye, bye, Pry!

Seemed like a great guy but couldn’t win and recruits only stayed 1 year Might just be we can’t pay players enough…are there even car dealerships in Blacksburg these days?

Doesn’t look like Whitt Babcock is going anywhere, which is a huge bummer.

So the current players now have a 30 day immediate eligibility transfer with no penalty and can still be considered for a redshirt year. Or can play immediately. If they waited one more week they have 4 games in and lose redshirt. So essentially there may be a jailbreak departure of half the team.

Interim choice makes sense, Montgomery is a former HC at Tulsa. GO HOKIES!

What is it like from a players perspective to have your coach fired because YOU lost a game? That must be tough to take.

So happy, Blacksburg deserves better!

I know nothing about football so I’m curious. Why is it Brent Prys fault that the team played bad? Is it bad plays that he made? Bad leadership that makes the team weaker? Just don’t quite understand why it’s his fault if the team is playing poorly.

Wonder what Bruce Arians is up to these days...

VT, where did all the money go?

This should the most upvoted post in VT subreddit history

If you dig deep enough, you can usually find the root cause of the problem. Whit Babcock hired Justin Fuente and Brent Pry. All 3 just mentioned are losers. Babcock reports to the Board of Visitors. All but one board member was appointed by Glen Youngkin. So, the VT athletic programs are governed by an all star cast of losers.

They should hire Marcus Vick

official statement reads like he’s out as soon as the BoV has a plan

https://preview.redd.it/wknt6psoj6pf1.jpeg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e0918b47443934bf5c687ba35bd53acaea6f3b2d It doesn’t sound based on reliable sources he is going anywhere. BUT, at least he isn’t head of the search. But why should your athletic director be athletic director if he can’t be trusted to make decisions?

Also want Babcock out but gonna play devil’s advocate here. The consensus was that Brent Pry at the time in 2021 felt like a great hire. He came from a strong team (Penn State) and was successful there. How much of it is actually on Babcock if Pry didn’t meet anyone’s standards?

Whoever next FB coach is CANNOT buy Fuente/Pry’s home. It’s clearly built on some land with bad juju. Needs to be condemned.

Another reason the problem lies with his being hired in the first place. He was not ready to be an HC even though he checked most of the boxes with other credentials.

If ha has true character he will donate half his buy-out to the program’s NIL fund.

I’m wondering how things were behind the scenes in the locker room.

thought the same but might be easier to cut ties with a complete regime change with a new staff if he's not interim.

Montgomery does have previous HC experience.

thats the thing - the firing isnt as much a solution as it is a reformulation of the problem. Time to act efficiently, quickly, and diligently. GO HOKIES!

That one might take some patience. They won't announce both at the same time.

School president doesn’t usually make a statement on the football coach, the AD does…the fact that whit wasn’t the one to make this announcement speaks volumes imo

the official statement reads like he is, tbh

The statement is by sands not babblecocks so maybe there is hope

That guy needs to go. Dude has trashed the basketball and football programs. If he picks another coach like Pry that could put VT in an unrecoverable tailspin.

I don't think they have anyone to fill in as Interim AD. I imagine the BOV will start a silent search tho.

Dominos fall one at a time.

Firing Whit needs to happen after football season. Need an AD in to conduct the search before the CFB playoffs start. Tech cannot have Whit hire his third football coach. Most AD's get two, then they're out. Its time to search for a new AD.

Did they say that?

I wouldn’t be so sure. It’s very telling that the AD didn’t announce the firing of the HC

Not one game or even three - this is a move based on a fair assessment of Pry's entire tenure - most of these players were in HS when he was hired. GO HOKIES!

The jury is still out on the quality overall of the players this year. But, last year we had a great squad that could have won 9-10 games with our soft schedule. Look at all the players that are now in the NFL/SEC from that squad. So much talent. Pry was allowed to hire rookie coordinators that never panned out and Whit let him. Clock mgmt issues, penalties, poor game mgmt, lousy play calling. None of these have gotten better in 4 years. They both need to go.

At a certain point the players are executing a game plan/plays that the coaching staff picks, and the game plans we've seen in the last 4 years are Second Pacific Fleet at the Battle of Tsushima bad.

So onboard with this possibility.

It’s a combo of what you mentioned really plus much more. Pry was weak to recruit in Virginia and missed out on lots of good athletes due to those poor tactics. He made no changes to the bad play calling that Fuente utilized during his time and didn’t improve anything about the team. The players are not playing well, but if they’re following what their coaches tell them to do, that’s not on them. They can only work with what they’re given. There are players that are bad. Drones has proven he’s not fit as a starting quarterback, but Pry’s resistance to benching him is another reason he has to go. A coach, like any good leader, is responsible for those that fall under him. If they’re underperforming, it’s an indictment on his skills as a coach. Going 0-3 in the opening trio of games is something not even Fuente did. We haven’t seen that since 1987. All in all, Pry was a stale addition to the program, and in his inability to make any improvement, actively made the team worse.

I’m glad somebody asked, I was gonna make a post but it probably would’ve gotten me chewed alive 😆

Hope springs eternal... Can't happen quick enough.

Yeah it feels like this presentation they’ll have by the end of the month is a way to see if Whit is willing to make drastic changes and if not maybe they move on from him. You figure firing an AD is a little more of a process than the HC so this might be part of it

They should have a plan by now, I’m sure they saw this as a big possibility all off season.

I rescued the flip-flop from California

Well done fellow Hokie…If ya ever get tired of it I’ll take it off your hands…

The real question is does it float?

What’s the background on this massive VT flip flop?

Wouldn't it be cool to live in the same house as this flip-flop?! While you're here you might as well check out my listing: https://offcampus.vt.edu/housing/property/need-one-roommate-for-an-awesome-farmhouse-2-miles-outside-blacksburg/ocpmrddr3k

It belongs to the greenhouse board shop

Should go kayaking what that thing honestly!

Mail it to TOTS!!!

Uhhhh, the flip-flop from the previous post is a RIGHT shoe. This one's a left. THERE'S ANOTHER FLOP

https://www.reddit.com/r/VirginiaTech/comments/va3qpr/which\_one\_of\_yall\_left\_this\_in\_california/

I just wanna know where I can buy a pair of VT branded rainbow sandals.

It'd be even cooler to see if Greenhouse wants their stolen flip flop back.

700/month is crazy for that location

Might need to craft up some outriggers before I try that!

You can see the “VT” logo is flipped in the pic, so the whole pic is mirrored — so it really is the right shoe :)

There’s definitely more out there. Greenhouse board shop has had several stolen.

Wild. Thanks!

Too high? You do get basically 2 bedrooms and your own bathroom for that price. I was thinking about setting up a 3d printing/makerspace sort of workshop in one of the rooms upstairs. 3 people could live there but that's the max (owner's rules due to being on a shared well) and one person would have a worse bedroom compared to the downstairs rooms.

I agree it’s a bit high. Prices in bburg are probably up a bit but when i lived on Harding at pheasant hill, I paid ~400/person for a 3br apt. Not a house but closer to campus and bt serviced the complex

I can't tell if my eyes are fooling me or not, but the top curves right. Doesn't that only happen for the left shoe? This is gonna hurt my brain...

How'd it end up in California then lmao

My guy, the picture was taken in a mirror, it's flipped

Location location location. Way too high.

When was that?

[I mirrored the mirror pic just for you.](https://imgur.com/nHGnxdf)

I’d guess someone moved and took it with them.

Ouch, my brain.

Bro have you SEEN rent now a days? MOST places in or around Blacksburg are this price now and places with less free spaces or as nice of a location as this are more in rent a crazy amount

Im so stupid 🤦‍♂️. I didn’t stop to think that the direction of the shoe would flip too lol.

It's far from campus and downtown. It lacks proper transit access. Its a lower quality property in general. So yes all those things combined $700 is too expensive.

Four years is a long time now. The pandemic really messed up housing prices.

For a house I’m honestly not surprised, from the pictures it’s a NICE property too

That’s fair. Mentioned that in my comment but of course I don’t quite know for certain. Just offering some insight

>The pandemic really messed up housing prices. The pandemic had nothing to do with it, it was Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion stimulus plan. When you dump a bunch of "free money" into people's checking accounts the price of everything gets bid up.

Even if it were a massive upscale house, a house in the middle of nowhere is still in the middle of nowhere.

Inflation has spiked globally. Gas/energy and food prices are up globally. Prior to the American Rescue Plan the government passed ~$3.5 Trillion in pandemic relief funding. You really think it is logical to blame it all on Biden? C'mon man, think it through if you're going to represent VT.

>You really think it is logical to blame it all on Biden? Yeah pretty much. The only thing standing between us and the abyss is Joe Manchin who is apparently the only Democrat in DC who paid attention in Econ 101.

No need for name calling friend. I've stated my reasoning. Take care.

"I'm sorry, $300 more a month just isn't doable for us" says the guy who makes $52,000 a month

Babe new VT salary power rankings dropped

If this gets taken down by mods I vote we purge this sub and make a new one without snowflake mods

Grad students should be paid more, I can't believe there are people defending this. I thought we as a society agreed on the living wage thing by now.

There's significant bloat in AP Faculty pay, but focusing on this top level might not be the best strategy. Arguably those salaries are all market driven, and many of those listed bring in more money to the university than they take out, either through fundraising or grants. For example, #85 on the top 100 paid at VT in 2021 is the head of government relations at $277k. What other state-supported entity in Virginia pays their head lobbyist $277k? \#100 is the VP for communications at $266k. What other state-supported entity in Virginia pays their head of communications $266k? VP for Finance comes in at #45 at $333k. What other state-supported entity in Virginia pays their head of finance $333k? And that's just the top 100. For reference, the Governor of Virginia makes $175,000. But he's political. Operationally, the head of Virginia's Department of Corrections (a massive, billion dollar enterprise operation), makes $203k. The head of Virginia's Department of Health during the pandemic--a medical doctor--made $231k. You want to find the money? It's there. It's not about the highest paid per se, but rather those paid more than appropriate for a publicly-supported university premised built on the premise of service.

$300 a month, or $3600 a year, to each of the 7063 graduate students would cost the same as giving a $10,908 raise to each of the 2331 teaching faculty. A $20,000 raises to these 10 administrators cost the same as giving every graduate student an extra $2.35 a month. Virginia Tech decided it gets more value giving raises to faculty than to graduate students. Why should Virginia Tech give the money to graduate students instead of full time faculty? I don’t really have an opinion one way or another, I’m just curious why Virginia tech’s decision was a bad one, in your eyes?

We hope this meme is fresh enough for resident meme critic u/elwynhuck

This isn't a problem unique to VT, it's happening at UVA too, probably to a much greater extent since the cost of living in Charlottesville is many times higher than Blacksburg. This is more of a VA-state govt issue in regards to (1) state worker (and NIH) pay bands being suppressed, despite inflation (2) ability for state employees and others to effectively unionize and negotiate better pay (3) if they raise graduate student stipends to reflect inflation, then they need to do this as well for all staff with degrees making under the minimum faculty salary. In summary, everyone is currently getting screwed (students & staff) except for the highest earners among the faculty & admin. Athletic coaches aren't exactly hurting either, salary wise...they could endure some cuts and be just fine. How do you change this? Not sure. Forcing out & retiring all of the boomer faculty/admin who are completely out of touch with reality is a start though. Further change will have to come from the state govt, which is unlikely to happen until the next election.

He gets paid that much because he fundraises a ton of money for the university. The university will always pay up to keep faculty who make tech money. Graduate students are an expense to the university. While they do participate in research and teach intro classes, tech knows they are a dime a dozen, while faculty that can bring in millions of dollars a year are much harder to find. Edit: A better way to put it might be graduate students are replaceable, while he isn't. Tech is a top-tier research institution because people like Phelgar bring in grant money for the university. While graduate students might help with the research, the money is given to tech because of the faculty members' efforts. If you were to fire every graduate student and replace them with new ones, the amount of grant money tech receives wouldn't be affected. However, if you remove the fundraisers like Phelgar, you end up with less money. Tech has no incentive to raise the pay of graduate students and every incentive to raise the pay of the fundraisers for precisely this reason. You can downvote me all you want, it doesn't change the fact that graduate students have little leverage to change their situation, and only make themselves look bad by doing things like this

Grad students are getting paid?

Here's a radical idea: The cost of moving all grad students to a minimum $2,400 stipend is about $2.5 million. All state employees will be receiving a 5% salary increase this year; potentially a 7% increase, depending on how the budget ends up. Most employees at VT are university employees; only a few are still state employees (going back to changes made in the early 2000's). Nevertheless, as a rule of thumb, whenever the state puts in a salary increase for state employees, the university follows with an increase for all employees. But if the university did not give that 5% increase to all employees making $250,000 or more, the cost savings would be around $2 million. . .about 80% of what's needed for the $2,400 12-month stipend. (fact check me--the top 100 earners made a combined total of $35.2 million in 2021, prior to a 5% increase last year. A 5% increase on that $35.2 million is $1.76 million. The lowest of the top 100 earners made $266k, so you'd also factor in those making between $250k and $266k). &#x200B; So take it a step further. Get a list from the university of everyone who makes over $250k. Approach each one. Ask them to personally sign on to the plan. It's not costing them anything they already have, only a future 5% increase to their salaries of a quarter million dollars or more. I imagine most university admins lean left of center and have personal beliefs about equity and a certain amount of wealth redistribution--see if they'll personally back up their beliefs by forgoing 5% added to their 250k+ salaries. So graduate students can start to have a living wage.

Really puts it in perspective

What’s the pay rate for the grad students? Is there tuition discounts as well? How many hours a week are they working?

Certified VT moment

If you ask me, they're ALL Dinguses.

You do not need to make that much money if u live in Blacksburg

Another Grad post crying

Barrier to success. Earn the success first. Then talk to me about what deserve or have earned. Everyone deserves a living wage. But your idea of what a living wage is doesn't along with everyone's. Figure that part out before you count other peoples money.

If the tuition assistance isn’t enough and you aren’t able to make ends meet through other means, maybe the grad student life isn’t for you 🥶 *preparing for downvote army *

Oh my! Look at how under paid the VT administration is.

Here come the power scaling YouTubers

Based take.

What posts are you referencing that were removed by snowflake mods? The last posts removed were done by Reddit admins.

Well everyone “agrees in principle”, but when you ask administrators to actually do anything about it, that’s where it gets dicey.

I disagree, or rather think there are other university employees that are more deserving of pay increases. Budget is limited and is a constant battle between increasing tuition and increasing pay. Grad students already get a really sweet deal. When factoring in their tuition remission, they are earning $60+ per hour. What about the undergrad student workers who are earning $15/hour? Or the housekeeping staff? Or the dining workers? Or the grounds staff?

You signed up for it. Lol. You could have chosen to enter the work force and save money before grad school. Further, grad school is less affected by periodic lapses in enrollment than undergrad is. But since you didn't, it's our fault that you aren't being paid enough? Foh.

Yeah and I think it's okay to be disappointed and upset that a so called non-profit state funded school is abusing their ability to provide degrees as a way to get cheap labor from hard working graduate students to then over pay less important replaceable administration (who control the overall movement of pay etc). The truth is the people in power are abusing their power to unequally distribute pay versus where the value is. It's okay though, this happens in all walks of life. The only thing you can do is to strike and make them pay your worth. I understand everyone is upset, we expect fair pay and fair distribution from a NON PROFIT TAX FUNDED UNIVERSITY. The non-logical fight from admin to suppress this actively shows they know what they are doing. If it wasn't a big deal then they would just let people go and fill the spots with new people. Strike and collect, and have absolutely no forgiveness. There is no crime in getting paid what you are worth. You don't owe any of these people anything, especially since they are so obviously aware that the status quo is in the students favor.

Oh, and the Board wants to raise tuition by up to 5% because they "need to" because the state is giving state employees a 5% salary increase, and 80% of VT's expenses come from personnel costs. Because of the bloat in the higher-paid AP Faculty salaries, the average salary is 97k. So a 5% salary increase costs a lot. And it apparently needs to come from increasing tuition, rather than finding common sense cuts. So college becomes incrementally less affordable. Ut Prosim. You can't make this s--- up.

Because the work Grad students do is integral to the functioning of the University and they don't get paid a living wage while many professors live comfortably off salary and other incomes (local business and textbook sales for some). How many professors have grad students grading all their assignments or running their lab? They deserve more than what they get and it would take a drop out of the bucket for much of the upper administration.

This semester there are 3,658 grad students on assistantships -- but to answer your question of why, every person deserves a living wage. Grad students are struggling. (and so are a lot of people on campus -- the living wage task force report that grad students advocated for also made the recommendation that staff should be paid a living wage too!) Luckily, VT has not yet made it's decision. The Board of Visitors meets to discuss the 2023-2024 budget on March 19th and 20th. We hope to see everyone there!

This is a problem in academia in general. As a PhD graduate from VT (2015), one thing that always stood out to me is how small and insignificant I felt in graduate school. They pay us exactly how they see and treat us. The only way to make a difference is to withhold your services so they can feel the sting of how difficult life is without you. I know for a fact the chemistry department at VT can not teach a single week of classes without graduate students. I wish there was a way for you to withhold services without it making your life unfeasible.

Obviously you have no idea how much grad students contribute to writing proposals and grants. Also by saying grad students are replaceable you have absolutely zero experience in training new grads so they can work efficiently to finish the proposal on time so they can secure the fund source for years. There are many labs where the students know much more than their professors, and this is the very reason why professors can focus on managing labs and projects. You can downvote me all you want, it doesn't change the fact that you have little mind to appreciate grad students' roles in bringing funding to tech, and only make yourself look bad by doing things like this

Anybody who wants to calculate how much money they make Virginia Tech can do so using formulas in our latest zine! [https://www.mediafire.com/file/xf5oy5w8dlrsne7/Anonymous\_Stories\_Zine\_2\_Digital\_Version.pdf/file](https://www.mediafire.com/file/xf5oy5w8dlrsne7/Anonymous_Stories_Zine_2_Digital_Version.pdf/file)

> You can downvote me all you want, it doesn’t change the fact that graduate students have little leverage to change their situation, and only make themselves look bad by doing things like this First, don’t bitch about downvotes when you’re plus 18. Second, the reason they do these things is **because** they lack a great deal of leverage. Grad employees have one thing they can leverage in negotiations and it’s their labor. As someone who helped to lead a graduate union through a labor stoppage let me tell you it’s a hard fight. We all understand there is a logic to the cruelty but the point is that’s it’s cruel. People who labor deserve not to subsist on scraps. Though I suppose some people do get by on shoe leather.

lol u/HoundCiS has it right. You clearly have no idea what the fuck you're talking about. A PhD student in my lab wrote the entire proposal that will be split among 3 professor's labs. They just signed off on it. I have written the bulk of two proposals worth 325k that just needed a go over. Three other PhD candidates in my lab are writing proposals. Most professors who are not early career are not writing their own proposals unless they've mismanaged their labs. Beyond that, many labs have half a dozen projects going on. You seriously think that it's the professors that are doing the research on all of these projects? Fuck no. Go look at their publications and see how many they're first author on versus how many their grad students are first authors on if you want a breakdown of who is actually doing the work. A PhD student who graduates is by definition considered an expert once they receive their doctorate, and a requirement of graduating is to have pushed the field into areas previously unexplored. Do you think that any one professor has the same breadth of knowledge as the possibly dozen or more of their PhD candidates, each with their own specific niche? Without all these different research thrusts, there are no grants. And no, you absolutely cannot just replace every single graduate student. Go ask any professor and see if they would be okay with replacing their entire fucking lab group. Unless they're a shit lab manager who created a dysfunctional lab environment, not a single one would be willing to do that. Institutional knowledge is a thing and gets passed down among lab members. Cohesive, supportive environments are not created overnight and are not so easily replicated. Only a fool who seriously think they can just purge their entire workforce without serious consequences to productivity and quality. People have been saying the same shit for forever about "nonessential workers" then been bitten in the ass when those nonessential workers aren't available.

A minimum of $1,679, but all the grad students at VT that I’ve know made $2,000-2,200. Their tuition is covered, that’s $16,216 per semester ($4054 per month) for out-of-state students, or $8,541 per semester ($2,135 per month) for in-state students. The above assumes they are on a full-assistantship, which is 20 hours per week.

Your privilege is showing. Not everyone has mum and dad's bank accounts to get through by "other means"

That's nice and classist of you. Also, "making ends meet through other means" is not available to all or even most graduate students. We can't have jobs outside the ones we have on campus.

While I appreciate the explanation now, I'm a bit skeptical. Two weeks ago there was [a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/VirginiaTech/comments/11den2e/why_are_the_grad_students_posts_being_removed/) that stayed toward the top of the sub for a couple of days asking the same question: why were the posts removed. All of the mods were tagged in one of the comments. Radio silence. Maybe the mods don't read every post, but it was a question in the title that only mods could answer. And mods were tagged. If it was just a matter of "it wasn't us, it was Reddit", why not say that then?

So you or any of the mods have never taken down a post that calls out the bureaucratic woke vt administration?

The issue with your calculation for how much we make has been discussed at length in other threads, but it's worth reiterating. We can't live off of tuition remission and, at a certain point, it's just the university paying itself (e.g. grad students don't take classes in the last few years of our degree). I've also had yet to meet a grad student that actually is able to keep their hours to 20/week, it's usually more like 40-60, and we are prohibited from having outside employment (even if we did have time). Staff and other student workers absolutely deserve to be paid more. This was something that grad students on the living wage task force and across the university brought up specifically and repeatedly. This is not an "us or them" issue, it's systemic across all levels of the university and it's reductive to turn it into pitting groups of underserved workers against each other.

As a former dining employee I would have loved more than $15 an hour, but that doesn't decrease the Grad student need. It's a matter of those that make a living wage getting more, improper spending, and leaving those struggling without any recourse. If dining, Grad students, and other undervalued employees all support each other rather than saying I deserve it more we can get a lot farther.

Seconding that AP faculty bloat. And if it hasn't been mentioned--- most faculty do not get the 5% salary increase. The university skims off a decent amount so they can give "merit raises," and then what remains is given to faculty based on how your department has ranked you. In the past 8 years every time a "5% salary increase" was approved by the state I have seen between 2.25% and 4% max, even if I was ranked extremely high in my department, and that raise was labeled a "merit raise." So while the state approves 5%, it doesn't mean all your faculty will actually get 5%. And you have a whole tier of faculty, full-time instructors, who frequently make below $50,000, a number are below $45,000. I'm curious if the higher paid AP faculty brackets more consistently get the actual state-approved raise, given the skimming from everyone.

If you added up these ten administrators salaries and divided it equally among all 3658 grad students on assistantship they’d get less than $2000 a year. Raising the wages of all the graduate students is not a drop in the bucket. It would cost a lot of money.

False. Lol. Grad students are not integral to VT. That's your first and biggest lie. What is integral, is the faculty, whom many grad-level students specifically follow to VT. The research grads do is important to be sure but to call yourselves integral is asinine. There are at least. 14 things more important to the running of the university than grad students. Lol. Some nerve. Lol

Many professors have comfortable salaries. Adjuncts generally get paid shit, though.

And a lot of grad students also teach a LOT depending on their department. They and instructor ranks should be natural allies, given instructors frequently have higher student credit hour ratios the TT faculty, yet are grossly underpaid by comparison. Look up the BOV approved salaries for faculty for 2021-2022 and then 2022-2023--- you can see how many instructor rank make only the base pay for instructors (which I believe is still $43,500, but check BOV's minutes to see the approved faculty compensation plan). You'll see a major jump in salaries between 2021-2022 and 2022-2023 in department of English after a massive push by instructors based on the fact they taught a significant majority of the student credit hours in the department yet made far under their TT counterparts. In 2021-2022 24/24 instructors made under $46,500 and their Advanced Instructors (those who had to have been employed at least 5 years full time and then evaluated for potential promotion) made from $47,000 - $50,000. After their push, their instructor rank's base salary was bumped to $50,000 and Advanced to $55,000. Now, Mathematics instructors got wind and want to push for their own increase given they're in a very similar situation (teaching the majority of student credit hours but almost all paid close to that low-end base pay for each instructor rank). I would bet the university does not want instructors and GTAs talking and would rather they were fighting--- they're natural allies given without their work keeps departments afloat.

Otter Sandman at the duck pond!

he the only one you saw? think it’s abt time of year for them to have pups

Survived the gator!

She's back!!!

It's nice that she has plenty of wotter.

We survey that stretch every year in my CAD class. It has been fun seeing the little critter.

Is hunting of them allowed?

I think this one was a girl! no pups though :(

And when it gets to summertime, it'll be a bit 'otter

If anyone touches otter sandman it’s on sight

if otter ain't there next week we bout to throw down

I don’t think bringing a gun to campus is a good idea…

I’m not gonna hunt shit I don’t even own any guns. I was just curious

If you have a problem with Otter Sandman you have a problem with me, I suggest you let that one marinate.

i was just curious

I’m sayin ‼️

alrighty brother. I’m not Bear Grylls here

My brother hates that I go to Tech My brother hates that I go to Tech. First of all, he graduated from UVA and works at a law firm. Like him, I am also seeking a law degree, but I’m at VT now. He hates that I’m graduating soon and he thinks the entire foundation of legal rule and the sanctity of law will be tarnished once I become a lawyer. To quote him directly, me being in law school is like “a chimp with a machine gun.” During our family Thanksgiving dinner today, he threw a tantrum in front of my family because he wanted to be the only lawyer. He wants to be the pride of the family. “Virginia Tech, for Christ’s sake?” He yelled at me as I asked my mom to pass the mashed potatoes. “What a joke. I worked my ass off to get where I am! And you take these shortcuts and you think suddenly you're my peer?” I used to work in the mail room in his law firm. He said he was proud of me then and wishes I never turned my life around. Every day, I think about dropping out and going back to my old job just to make him happy…

Do you have a history of taking shits through car sunroofs?

UVA rn: I am not crazy! I know he swapped those scores! I knew it was 17-55, not 55-17. One after the Seven Years War. As if I could ever make such a mistake. Never. Never! I just – I just couldn't prove it. He – he covered his tracks, he got that idiot Brent Pry to lie for him. You think this is something? You think this is bad? This? This chicanery? He's done worse. 2016! Are you telling me that we just happen to lose by 42? No! He orchestrated it! Sands! He overadmitted and keeps doing it! And I saved him! And I shouldn't have. What was I thinking? He'll never change. He'll never change! Ever since he was 9, always the same! Couldn't keep his team off steroids! But not our Timmy! Couldn't be precious Timmy! And he gets to be a president!? What a sick joke! I should've stopped him when I had the chance! And you – you have to stop him! You-

10/10 troll

Chuck McGill ass brother.

First of all, he graduated from Harvard Law School and works at a law firm. Like him, I am also seeking a law degree, but I’m at UIUC now. He hates that I’m graduating soon and he thinks the entire foundation of legal rule and the sanctity of law will be tarnished once I become a lawyer. To quote him directly, me being in law school is like “a chimp with a machine gun.” During our family Thanksgiving dinner today, he threw a tantrum in front of my family because he wanted to be the only lawyer. He wants to be the pride of the family. “UIUC, for Christ’s sake?” He yelled at me as I asked my mom to pass the mashed potatoes. “What a joke. I worked my ass off to get where I am! And you take these shortcuts and you think suddenly you're my peer?” I used to work in the mail room in his law firm. He said he was proud of me then and wishes I never turned my life around. Every day, I think about dropping out and going back to my old job just to make him happy…

Just throw a cell phone battery at him.

Soon he will never leave his home and will wrap himself in a solar blanket just to get the mail.

Tech that bad? Even a degree from University of American Samoa produces competent lawyers.

your brother just fuckin sucks.

Keep him away from gas lamps

ur brother needs to untwist his panties

Typical UVA grad who’s miffed at those who choose something other than their “public Ivy League.” You just have to know how to handle them. Give him a martini, some Adderall, and a navy and orange striped bow tie. He’ll calm right down.

Even though it’s all good man, this is totally believable coming from a uva’er

Amazing troll im dying

Sounds like your brother is jealous or simply isn't being supportive. Pretty immature and rude. He's over his head with his ego. All of these are signs of a hoo lmao.

Bro, if anyone takes the rivalry that seriously, they are messed up in the head Don’t drop out man, he’s just your brother. Stand your ground, tell him to chill out, if he doesn’t then stop talking to him? Always remember, you hold the power

Lazy shit post as VT does not have a law school.

He’s just mad because he knew they were going to get thumped again. Show him up and put out your best. Cave to him n you will always regret it n be his biatch.

Your brother a lawyer? Yet he thinks law will be tarnished🤔

imagine being a grown ass man and having these kinds of childish allegiances.

Absolute chicanery

If someone is still bitter over college choices after graduating, that's a massive red flag.

You should remind your brother that all going to UVA did for him was inflate his grades and his ego.

Im sorry you had to experience this. You are on your own path, don’t let your brothers insecurities and narcissism ever make you feel that you have to do something a certain way. I would recommend you begin finding ways to communicate and enforce boundaries around this type of behavior for you’re own good.

Something is rotten in Denmark. Two different users with brothers that hate that they are going to a different school for the same profession. https://www.reddit.com/r/BostonU/comments/183atjb/my\_brother\_hates\_that\_i\_go\_to\_bu/

Dude your brother sounds like a snake ngl, you keep getting that law degree, he is going to have to face the fact that you are going after your own dreams, and if he finds that as competition then that is his problem, not yours. Please don’t drop out, a degree is very important in these days

Spam shit had same post on UCF sub today.

Tech was going to have a law school back in the day, but then ended up not having one. But they had started to collect the law books for the library so Tech has one of the largest law libraries in the country, but no law school.

Ask him how it feels knowing that Whooville is now Blacskburg North...

Isn't UVA a basketball school?

Oh god it’s jimmy

Ah crap here we go again with the pasta.

Tell him you have the school he goes to

does this keep getting reposted with different schools?

I’ve seen this exact post 2 times but with other schools. /yawn

Are you really just re posting this in a bunch of campus subs?

It would be a shame if mashed potatoes were accidentally dropped onto his head.

why have i heard this story before, except the colleges were RICE and UH...

Your brother doesn’t exist.

I’d just laugh in his face and say “this is ridiculous, counsel suggests you learn to control your emotions before you have a tantrum in the court room in front of the judge”.

Time to start attending classes in Minecraft (Album in comments)

Oh damn. Is this on a server?

[https://imgur.com/gallery/T8jCUJG](https://imgur.com/gallery/T8jCUJG)

This is awesome!!!

Maybe you can convince the administration to let us meet “in person” in the minecraft map.

can you still get expelled if you venture the steam tunnels in the Minecraft world?

We're really out here huh

If I use vr minecraft ill be able to go to school again 🤣

Good luck man this is one hell of a project. That terrain was probably an ass kicking in itself

I’m really new to Minecraft. Is this a server you can join? Or...? Sorry for such a noob question.

Yeah, I'm running a discord/server to build campus if you're interested in joining. [https://discord.gg/Zh8dEeb](https://discord.gg/Zh8dEeb)

Are the buildings interiors done? Would be interested in a virtual CS lounge with virtual desperation.

I teach at a different school now, but the only reason I'm not considering Minecraft more seriously for my classes is because I can't be guaranteed that all my students have a laptop that can run it and are interested in playing it. I don't want to exclude anyone.

Lol someones gotta build the steam tunnels first.

Lmaooo big brain

Thanks, there's this amazing modpack that does the general terrain, building outlines, and roads but there's still been a shit ton of terraforming corrections.

Thanks! Might post more as progress is made.

You’re all good! It’s a server I’m running and we’ve got a group discord for it. There should be a link for joining the discord in the comments but I can resend it if u can’t find it

Maybe when campus is done we can build the town too

You should look into the 1:1 world map people are building and request to do campus in that map.

So far Torg Bridge is the only interior that has been completed. Feel free to join the Discord and check it out and help work on it if you want though.

Oh I bet. I didnt know such a mod pack existed though that's pretty handy

I found the instructions, but I’m not sure if I am doing it right :/ Is this accessible from the iPad app?

That’s the plan, just takes time

This is what it’s for. No way I could have done the terrain and building outlines without the modpack lol

Would a 1:1 world map fit in the 12,000,000x12,000,000 minecraft world? I know it’s technically infinite but the farlands get kinda wonky in the code

Depends on what you mean by 1:1 scale. If you assume one block is 1m^2 and the 12,000,000 x 12,000,000 is just surface blocks, then yes. The surface area of Earth is 196.9 million mi^2 (according to Google). (12e6)^2 = 1.44e14 surface blocks. Converting to miles: 1.44e14 / 0.000621371 ≈ 8.9477e10 mi^2 . All with 89 billion blocks to spare! Edit: Mixed up meters and miles in my explanation. Too many units...

A group made a modpack for 1:1 mapping the Earth into a single world. That's what we're using to get the terrain and outlines. Here's a video on the project [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8\_bW3ab8YAk&t=513s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_bW3ab8YAk&t=513s)

I am too lazy to do the math, but you did pique my curiosity enough to google the surface area of the earth in square meters and it comes up in the 500 trillion~ish range. The farlands being roughly 12 and a half million blocks out, I really don’t think it’s possible to make a 1:1. HOWEVER, I just googled and the farlands is a bedrock edition only thing, so I suppose it’s irrelevant

The large surface area comes into play since surface area grows exponentially in relation to side lengths of squares and radii of spheres. The actual math does get kinda weird since the surface of spheres are non euclidean space, but locally euclidean geometry works well enough. Looking a little deeper, I think my math works for flat square Earth but not for spheres since sqrt(500,000,000,000,000) would give roughly a 22,000,000 x 22,000,000 square. You've also really piqued my interest so now I'm going to do the only logical thing. Spend the rest of my day trying to figure out if you can build a 1:1 scale of Earth in Minecraft.

This is fine because the earth is flat.

Well since farlands aren’t an issue in the Java version I would assume the minecraft world is infinite in that version but I’m not sure.

Me after an entire online semester of doing the absolute bare minimum

CC to the rescue my friend.

A semester of unproctored online tests? Do what 90% of the student body is doing and your GPA might even get a boost.

Organic Chemistry II online is currently raping me.

Pass/Fail fam. U good Edit: Uh why am I downvoted but the top comment is "CC to the rescue my friend"

CC is great and all but the lack of structure is killing my motivation to want to do anything that’s school related :(

Cries in grad student

And to think I used to be happy to have project-based classes :(

Same man same

Chegg is your best friend. Worth the 15 bucks if you can afford it. Also office hours with the TAs helped a lot.

Because those are two different grading options. If you take a class as pass/fail, you dont get credit towards your degree. (i.e you cant take any classes that go towards your degree as pass/fail, they have to be A-F, even CLEs) if you take a class as CC, that credit goes towards your degree. So essentially, I can take all my classes as CC (even my core classes) this semester and still get credit towards my degree without it effecting my GPA.

No I agree, I'm having the same issues as well. I am doing the bare minimum as well and its hard to want to do any more than that now. But just remember you shouldn't feel awful about not being your most productive self considering the circumstances right now, just keep doing what you can.

Take the gift semester my friend. Learn what you need to from your classes for your future classes/career and enjoy the easier semester. I'm in my final semester and am *struggling* to keep up with my senior engineering design stuff right now. I'm so burnt out that I want to give up on everything. Make sure this doesn't happen to you.

Alright I kind of assumed everyone knew I meant CC/CN

Sounds about right...

Its crazy seeing your fb status go full circle and get posted by someone else on twitter and then on reddit. What a time to be alive.

If it makes you feel better she did give you credit for the origin (when she was talking to me about it)

Thank you for the request, comrade. I have looked through profanitycounter's posting history and found 183 N-words, of which 42 were hard-Rs.

I attended VT from '98 to '03... My VT friends were mostly from NOVA and had friends that went to UVA so we always went to Charlottesville for the away games. I remember one year where we sat next to some UVA frat and all of them were shirtless with body paint. They fucking painted themselves with white dress shirts, blue blazers, and orange ties. Such quintessential UVA.

That's just UVA though. When you move to Charlottesville you're issued a cardigan.

For auld lang syne, they'll be having their Zima by enema. They prefer these chilled so they're still in the cooler.

Lurking on your school’s rival’s reddit screams unemployed lmfao

I make more money than all of my Hoo friends 🤷‍♂️

My brother was a Hoo from ‘09-‘13 and at his first football game he and a few friends got front row, were shirtless, and painted “HOOS!” with one letter on each chest. My brother was the exclamation point. My mother was appalled 😂😂😂

Idk why but it took me a solid minute to realize that’s only four years apart because it seems longer

My best friend is a Hoo, same years, me too. That ‘09 year they went like 2-9 😂

I totally do the same haha

Virgini[A] Tech logo

Why is the [A] in brackets like that?

That's cool. I don't like the newer logo with the dipsey doodle in between the letters.

Where did this come from? I like

This needs to be an animated wallpaper

It needs ESPN easing in from bottom right. Well done.

It’s a tag for animated, as opposed to a real life video I imagine.

This is the athletic logo, the one you refer to is the academic logo. They are separate entities. For some perspective, everyone hated the old academic logo when it came out, too. All the alumni chapters were co-opting the athletic logo anyway since it's so recognizable, but if you do that too much you lose your trademark. The school already struggles with some things they didn't trademark; for example "Hokies" is trademarked but "Hokie" is not, thus we got Hokie Honda and Hokie Hair. The HokieBird facing left is, facing right he is not. There is a lot of money to be made and lost in trademark law.

So true, they never should’ve changed it

Palestine encampment protest in front of the GLC

VT is probably going to get it removed by commencement.

What are the demands? Anyone get a picture of the bedsheet?

I hope Tech admin reacts a whole lot less stupidly than other schools'

Peaceful protests on college campuses are hardly a new phenomenon. It’s kind of what we expect and want college to be - think for yourself, pursue your passions, believe you can make a difference in the world. All power to them. Just keep it peaceful.

Don’t these people have finals to study for?

I mean our school is probably one of the most symbolic in the US to do this in given the school’s relationship with the military, but I still don’t see what having the encampment *here*, in the GLC lawn, does? It’s so out of the way. And the goal is divestment, does VT even have any investments in Israeli companies lmao? Do this shit in DC, inconvenience the mfs actually making the decisions if you want anything to change. Just sitting on the GLC lawn isn’t going to do anything.

This accomplishes what?

Hopefully the administration ignores them and does nothing to make them into martyrs.

I'm genuinely so confused why people pay so much attention to Palestine vs Israel when there are literally millions of Muslims being sent to Chinese concentration camps, a raging civil war in Myanmar, a war against democracy in Ukraine...I think it's very telling that people plant their flags at every opportunity there is to bash Israel and call me a Zionist for thinking that Israel has the right to exist. It's like it's the 1920s all over again. Fuck Hamas.

Super disappointing to see the comments being made about this on this Reddit. Then again I don’t know what I was expecting

Honestly super disappointed at a lot of the discourse in this thread. There are absolutely routes of discourse that can happen that don't involve backing the explicit war crimes of the Netanyahu admin or regurgitating Hamas propaganda.

Anyone saying Israel doesn't have the right to avenge what happened on October 7th is horribly wrong

hi everyone! this is gonna be long, but here’s some information: the demands for virginia tech administration are 1. Divest from Israel and provide endowment transparency, 2. Issue an official statement condemning Israel’s violence against Palestine and the genocidal loss of life, and 3. Define anti-Palestinian racism and acknowledge the suppression of Palestinian and allied students on campus. for those asking “why tents on a lawn,” the reason this was at the GLC and not the drillfield was to ensure the encampment would not be taken down as soon as it was erected. plus this design of protest is specifically organized to show solidarity with the thousands of palestinians who have been displaced into tent communities and lack safe and consistent access to basic necessities like food and water. for those asking “why virginia tech,” it is proven that nearly every drone used in gaza has a piece of VT hardware or software, VT has a close partnership with VIAB and therefore receives lots of funding from Israeli businesses/coalitions (thus proving significant bias), and VT has released statements supporting Israeli students (such as lighting burruss up in israel’s flag colors and promising to “always stand with israel”) yet has failed to reference or support its Palestinian students in any manner. additionally, the virginia tech foundation (as a 501c3 nonprofit) is NOT required to share where donations/endowment money goes, so although we know it sends funds to DoD, Boeing, Northrop, etc. we have no idea what %. also, for those saying this is just to look like martyrs/because other universities did it so VT students thought to join in, no dawg. VT has been peacefully protesting for palestine since october. this is nothing new, just a new escalation. also, yes, obviously, students have classes and finals - no one was trapped there. many people left for class and came back, did homework/studied at the camp, etc. because THIS is what the students care about. THIS is bigger than a finals season. lastly, stop spreading false rhetoric about these protests - there are no “death to israel” signs or anything antisemetic as part of the pro-palestinian group at VT, and if you claim there were, i’m sure i and everyone else would love to see the proof that doesn’t exist. anywho thanks for reading, free palestine 🇵🇸🍉

Must be nice not having any classes or finals to study for

Where were you all when the Uyghur of China, A Muslim Population, was being rounded up and murdered like the The Holocaust. If you are reading this, and protesting, and have never heard of the Uyghurs before. You should re-evaluate how easily manipulated you are.

all the zionist here defending israel…. get a life

Waste of time and space

the kids are alright👏👏

I’m sure this is helping the people in Gaza

How about they offer up their time and obviously vast knowledge and experience and voluntarily go to Gaza to assist the poor starving Palestinians. No? Easier to sit in America and complain about how evil the world is without the slightest idea of what it’s really like there? I’ve been to places in that part of the world that these whining “children” wouldn’t last 5 minutes in acting like they are here. But, I guess that’s the greatness of a democratic nation. You have the right to act like a complete bigot, racist fool with no fear of personal harm. Try that garbage in the Middle East (with one glaring exception) and see how long your little tent city lasts. Good luck world if these are the future leaders.

I'm glad to see Hokies on the right side of history.

As an alumni, how can I support these folks?

Thank you to my fellow Hokies!!! #FreePalestine🇵🇸

Barvo, but I have to get my diploma.

Are any of those clowns still out there or did they go home?

It's worth putting out there that divestment is not an effective strategy for affecting change because all the assets that get sold will be drive the price down, allowing someone who doesn't care about the issue to buy them for cheap and get a better return. Also, engineering alone has named professorships funded by NAVSEA, Norththrup, Raytheon, and Rolls Royce. I think anyone who is asking for VT to be anything less than totally on board with the military industrial complex is living in an alternate reality.

Future baristas coming to a Starbucks near you

Good on them! Free Palestine!!

These people are lame.

So if you don’t support our military and don’t like where the engineers from school and contracts are aligned, go to a liberal school. There are choices. You don’t get to demand an institution change its policies because you don’t like them. You are welcome to leave 👋🏻

Not surprised with the people here in the comments, no mention of Hamas instigating the war with October 7th kidnappings, OR Joe Biden giving Iran back access to money so they can fund not just the Red Sea Houthi terrorists but also Hamas. And who's suffering? Innocent civilians on both sides. Palestine was the name of an area of desert which was never an independent country but always under the control of empires/kingdoms/states (Persian, Macedonian, Phoenician, Roman, Egyptian, multiple different emirates/sultanates, crusader states LIKE THE KINGDOM OF JERUSALEM, etc.). So what did Israel do after they took what was a barren desert with no permanent settlements to create a civilization with infrastructure, give some of the land to the Arabic tribes that were there just so they could have it backfire. But hey, who am I to say the facts to people who don't think about the facts and are just going to start REEEEEING, down vote this, and type some short small sentence without any facts or basis like "that's not true because (just) X (not Y and/or Z)" or "you don't know what your talking about". Oh yea, also why isn't neighboring Arabic countries like Egypt or Arabia taking in and sending aid to the displaced Palestinians?

Remember when all those protests ended Vietnam. Me neither

These people need to get up out my way, it’s getting real old

Lot of folks sitting at that protest look like they are accidentally eating all the aid meant to be sent to Gaza.

Is it confirmed that the protestors are VT students, or are they outside agitators?

https://preview.redd.it/y8aqo5nb8cxc1.jpeg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2ca231bfc9e421ab03c60268bd752fa8a07d565e Dear useful friend…

Word is they're moving on it tonight?

Don't see why. This is no where near where commencement is held.

Can’t see the demands exactly, but very likely a call to divest from companies profiting off the war. That what many of the other student protests are calling for.

They certainly aren’t demanding a release of the hostages and Hamas’ unconditional surrender.

https://preview.redd.it/hdvwcmws7xwc1.jpeg?width=1125&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a474baa7d64d33092f43c11199eb350b336fc3e2

Getting rid of Israel. That’s usually what “Palestinian liberation,” “free Palestine,” and “From the River to the sea [Palestine will be free]” mean. Many don’t realize it, but that’s the origin and regional use of those slogans.

The students seemed to be pretty non confrontational and there were 2 cops there but they were just sitting like 20 feet away chilling which is a good start

Scared I’m being followed/ stalked So within this past week this boy came to my door and tried to open it and failed. I saw him through the peep hole and didn’t answer (keep in mind he did this 5 min after my bf left). Then a few days later a girl comes and does the same thing although this time I answer and she says wrong address but started to look around my place. Today the same guy comes back and does the same thing but my bf answers and he goes “sorry, I thought this was my place”. ALL WHILE LOOKING AROUND MY APT. I’m really freaked out so I filed a police report. Both are Asian, male 5’8 dark hair, slim build & woman is 5’5, Asian, slim build. Not sure what to think but really freaked out

I would suggest maybe purchasing a ring camera if it's in your budget

Yeah that’s suspicious activity for sure. I don’t think that you are being followed or stalked but it could be possible that they were looking around your apartment for valuables like others commented. Strange to continuously do it so there’s an underlying reason here so filing a report was a good idea just in case police get other calls for the same people.

In addition to what everyone else has suggested, tell your neighbors too. This is classic casing for burglary.

More likely they’re casing your apartment than anything else.

Tell the Blacksburg PD and the apartment manager. A maintenance man may have seen these people walking about. Your phones have cameras. If you have roomies, ask them to record. Keep doors and windows locked at all times. As someone else said, get a video doorbell.

This isn’t advice, so don’t take it as advice, but personally I would be direct. “Come back here again and we’ll have a problem.” I would want them to know I think they’re sus.

Lock doors and windows, keep valuables hidden when you are not there, and consider purchasing a self defense weapon

If you have a bottom floor apartment, get some sticks or dowels to shove in your window tracks so they can't be opened, and maybe consider getting a security stick like this one: [https://www.amazon.com/AceMining-Upgraded-Security-Adjustable-Apartment/dp/B0BKKTFWJK/ref=sr\_1\_1\_sspa?keywords=security+stick&qid=1698162007&sr=8-1-spons&sp\_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY&psc=1](https://www.amazon.com/AceMining-Upgraded-Security-Adjustable-Apartment/dp/B0BKKTFWJK/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?keywords=security+stick&qid=1698162007&sr=8-1-spons&sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY&psc=1)

That sounds like people targeting a house for theft. Sometimes people will use bogus reasons for a chance to look inside the house and see if there is anything valuable. Do not open the door to anyone you do not expect to come visit. Do not confront them under any circumstance. Again, do not open the door- call the police if they come again. File a police report. Make sure your landlord/building manager knows what is going on. Your neighbors too, they may be able to give you more information or support you if they return.

Do you have pepper spray, a baseball bat, a nightstick, or a birdie alarm? What could you grab in the worst-case-scenario, and decide where's the best place for it to be located

Get a blink doorbell or ring doorbell cam too

The property management may have cameras around, I'd ask them if they do can the pics / vids be checked for these two. And take a pic of them if you see them again, even if not at your door step.

report to blacksburg pd. always better to be safe than sorry

jesus never answer the door in that situation

My current roommate had people coming into her old townhouse. Her and her roommates didn't realize all the problems they were having weren't from each other leaving messes or stealing food, it was the people they caught breaking into their house while they were gone to class, dinner, etc. So best case scenario, they're new to the area and making a genuine mistake. Worst case scenario, get window and door jams and any other personal protection you feel comfortable with

Get a 12 gauge shotgun if possible and if you’re comfortable with firearms. Everything else will only slow an intruder down. A weapon for defense actually stops them.

Call the cops? They rightfully get a bad wrap...but they're there for this reason.

Probably not a stalker, especially because it’s two people of different genders. Sounds to me like they are casing your apartment. This is exactly why we have the 2A, don’t know why every young female doesn’t own one🤷🏼

Hey, all I'm saying is that I love this song. Has a great message. 😇 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0eDOlfQ-Jk&ab\_channel=MirandaLambert-Topic

Go to animal shelter and get a big dog.

Make sure you have something to protect yourself. I would suggest a firearm but doing so would be against university policy

Keep your damned door locked at all times. Period. When someone tries to open, yell out I'm armed and ready to kill !

Buy a shotgun and pump it when they next show up

You can't just shoot people. You will end up in prison, no water what the gun people tell you.

Be vigilant and ask friends/co workers/campus police for escorts around campus at night. Part of me thinks if they are both Asian, one male and one female and possibly foreign students, their friend who lives in same area might have given them the wrong address. This could happen if it is a large apartment complex. I have knocked on the wrong door before in this scenario.

It doesn't necessarily have to be ring either. Blink has them. They even have people cameras that you mount on the inside of your door

With that being said, make a report to Blacksburg PD.

“I have cameras, a police report on file, and will defend myself if necessary, do not come here again”

Maybe take a video of them when you open the door. That way they know you have proof to help ID them if anything happens. Edit: Record video from phone

classic reddit brainlet on display. "all cops are bad people BUT you should totally call them!!"

“Rightfully” is crazy Edit: It’s not fair to say that cops deserve the bad wrap they get because of the actions of few. Does there need to be reform? Yes absolutely. Anybody with a brain would agree with that. But you can’t make generalizations like that, it just isn’t fair. Tyrod Taylor’s doctor punctured his lung —> all doctors are bad

Because owning a gun makes you and others around you more likely to be killed by it. I just googled: “people who own firearms more likely to get shot with own gun burglar” and “gun owner shot with own gun” and got multiple results especially if the gun owner is scared and/or inexperienced

\>redditors upvoting comment saying all police are bad \>redditors downvoting comment saying to purchase a firearm which one is it? you either don't protect yourself (and have to rely on the big bad police) or you buy a gun

The downvotes don't make sense. People are afraid of this answer. Everyone hates guns until a criminal gets buck and you—a law-abiding citizen—have no way to defend yourself against *their* gun and ill intentions.

Are you trying to get offended by everything you see

Asian person here, how the fuck is this racist? OP was stating someway to identify the suspects that can not be easily changed like clothes worn. The suspects happen to be of Asian ethnicity, OP is simply warning people to be on the lookout with the information provided

maybe be careful posting about 9mm’s on the idk… Virginia Tech subreddit? lmao

Exactly this. Sounds like they are casing to possibly burglarize OP’s house when they’re not there. These types of thieves usually want to avoid confrontation at all costs because they aren’t “hard criminals”. Just you confronting them might be enough for them to write off the entire apartment complex as a whole. Of course, don’t do this when you’re by yourself; if it’s late at night or you’re alone I would just yell it through the door at them whenever they return.

I mean if the municipality and state are going to pay those goobers, you might as well get your money's worth.

Crazy how you get down voted for this

That’s why u shouldn’t be inexperienced. And I can cherry pick google searches too

This. I'm not right-wing, but people further down on the left seem to think so sometimes because 1) I don't think all cops are bad (they're not) and 2) I don't support being a defenseless sitting duck

this is primitive reasoning. wild. not understanding how someone might navigate a suspicious situation without a cop or gun

Because owning a gun makes you and others around you more likely to be killed by it. I just googled: “people who own firearms more likely to get shot with own gun burglar” and “gun owner shot with own gun” and got multiple results especially if the gun owner is scared and/or inexperienced

a pathetic basement-residing cretin such as yourself really should have no right to judge someone with a paying job, especially considering how unlikely it is you'll ever acquire one during your miserable existence

People don’t realize how good we have it in the US, and it’s really really sad.

The life of a Qdoba Line worker

Pro tip, we hook up people in line who we like, and right now that bar has been dropped to "can hear you order without straining"

It would be great if they'd turn down the music, I feel like that's 50% of the problem

I was ordering the other day and was literally shouting at the guy behind the line so he could hear me, like so loud people in line were looking at me funny. Idk what's up with that barrier but it seems like it's a whole lot harder for the line workers to hear the customers than vice versa. Also, I noticed the next person in line had the same person and was heard fine when using a slightly elevated talking voice so I kinda wonder if he didn't want to hear me, but I've worked the line before so ik the most random things can affect your ability to hear someone

Dude they closed the Qdoba down when I loved there. Did they open it back up?

This is every dining hall rn like pls speak up people, and/or use your finger to point at shit

Its hard with an entire plastic shield blocking the sound

I'm definitely one of the people you can't hear. My mask is super thick and the pitch of my voice doesn't carry.

My grandfather has finally been vindicated for always bugging me to enunciate when I was a kid.

We always do that for the regulars, too. I dunno if the triple steak and pork cadet still goes there. But if he does, don't you dare skimp out on the meat.

I miss not having masks because at least then I could try to lip read, but even that's impossible now

I agree, sadly I have no idea who has the aux

I’d much rather you yell at me than me struggle to hear. Also voice pitch can totally be a factor outside of volume

There is a Qdoba on campus, that never shut down. The Qdoba off campus is sadly still dead.

Yea we’re back open

5 minutes on mematic ftw

Yell at me for all I care I just want to get through the line lol

Please just yell at me for all I care

Speak up, clearly, and with confidence. Honestly you'll go very far in life off that alone.

The trick is to double their meat in the center and cover the double meat portion w/ queso

he graduated he’s out near VB now

[👁👄👁](https://i.imgur.com/M6VN32W.jpg)

I mean I don't mind yelling and I'm glad I was able to help, just putting it out there that it's not always people intentionally being quiet

Ah gotcha, I was a grad student and was never on campus. Thanks for the clarification.

What line 😳

I can't be the only person who's experienced this rollercoaster of emotions

I love our schools obnoxiously long legal name

Every time on handshake

Gotta love Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University lol

I've ran into this situation so many times, that it's mostly just sighing, then beginning to type every combination of names I know.

~~VT~~ VPI&SU

Thank T. Marshall Hahn. He built the school we know today. When he came to VPI it was almost entirely undergrad only, it was almost all engineering and agriculture with some applied sciences, and IIRC all males had to serve two years in the corps. This was before Pamplin even existed (formed during Hahn's tenure), and the Vet School wouldn't appear until 1978. His dream was to make it a "comprehensive university" rather than polytechnic, and to add a large graduate school. He also wanted to become a flagship campus of a multi-campus system absorbing VSU in Petersburg (the other land grant) and adding new campuses in rural areas. The new institution would be called Virginia State University, and mainly be modeled after Penn State and Ohio State. The Virginia General Assembly refused to allow this. A lot of UVA grads in the field who didn't like the idea of VT getting a large graduate school and becoming another flagship school. So they refused to allow the merger with VSU Petersburg. They couldn't stop the rest of the plan though, and in defiance, Hahn added "and State University" to the "Virginia Polytechnic Institute".

I like the data-compression ratio of “vt”. (Nearly as good as "L.A." compared to its [original full name](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles#History).)

Thing is if people don't know Virginia Tech's long name, it looks super sketchy. Like some unknown online for profit college.

L.A. is roughly a 3% abbreviation of El Pueblo de Nuestra Señora la Reina de los Ángeles de Porciúncula...also known as Los Angeles.

And how they insist on printing the whole thing on the bottom of everyone’s Hokie P

University of Maryland University College

Why on earth would they not print the actual name of the school?

UT Prosim is always the answer

Wreck it Wrona

This is definitely not true, I screw up most of the things I touch.

Please listen. Stay home.

Going insane at home and I'm not even 2 weeks in to the 24 it's gonna be

Actually this is the best time to go driving around! No one on the roads and low gas prices, hell yeah!!!!

People should avoid going to public when possible, but 67 cases in Virginia isn't enough to get me to stay at home. Will that number go up? yes. By a lot? Unlikely.

Enjoy it. Our parents are in their 70s and over a thousand miles away, so there's no quick or easy way for us to get to each other if anyone gets sick. Times like this make me really miss being closer to home.

^^^THIS. I love my family but there’s NO way I can stay here and do school and not go insane

Just don’t get out of the car

My roommate and I walked around Blacksburg. There is practically no one outside, so we are definitely social distancing still.

There isn’t even access to testing in Southwest VA yet. We have no idea how many cases are actually in VA.

March 9 the total USA cases were 546. It is 6500 at the beginning of today. You really don’t think it’s going to go up by a lot?

https://www.wdbj7.com/content/news/Southwest-VA-hospitals-prepare-for-coronavirus-568785831.html This says there are tests available, and the virginia deparment of health didn't report any positive cases in southwest va. Even if the number of cases went up to a a thousand and none of the infected people stay at home (which is very unlikely) there is a very small chance you'd run into them.

vdoh should update their numbers again by 12. But last time I checked they tested 500 more people with only 15 showing up positive, and it should be said that they are only testing people exhibiting symptoms

Testing is taking a while here. A professor on my floor goes to church with someone who returned from Europe and got sick, and he's been waiting for her test results so he can stop self-quarantining for over a week.

This is from a Facebook post made on Monday the 16th. I am not aquatinted with the original poster but I found this to sound accurate based on her other comments. The numbers of tests have changed since then but not greatly. “Okay, so I just made some calls because I was pretty curious about testing in our region. Here is what transpired. In each call, I asked, "if someone in my family has symptoms of coronavirus, can you test for it?" 1. Called Carilion Family Practice. Answer: "We can't do that." Me: "Where do we go, then?" Answer: "I honestly don't know. Maybe you should just stay home, since there is no treatment for it." 2. Called MedExpress. Answer: "We are referring people to the ER. We don't have the test kits here." Question: "Does the ER have the kits?" Answer: "I'm not sure, but we are referring people there." 3. Called New River Health District (phone number is very hard to find on the VA Dept of Health Web Page). Answer: "The ER can test for it, but they will only do so with a doctor's referral." Question: "So, I need to go to two medical facilities and potentially expose everyone at both?" Answer: "Our health department nursing staff might be able to refer you. Let me forward you." ... call was dropped... Okay -- last installment. I finally got through to the VA Dept of Health. I asked about testing availability. She said, "what part of the state?" I said, "Blacksburg, where Virginia Tech is". She said, "ohhhh... yeah, we don't have testing in that region at this time". She then proceeded to tell me that we could go to the ER, but the ER would probably not be able to test without getting in touch with the VA Health Dept. She said, "LabCorp should be able to test later this week, so maybe some of your healthcare facilities can test in a week or so" Virginia has tested 489 people as of today [03/16/20], in a state of 8.5 M people. Something is very, very wrong and we should be rising up to demand answers!”

This subreddit is a fucking hivemind. Respect on expressing your opinion and backing it up with facts. Anything that isn't typed by a soft, chubby 102 IQ redditor here will be downvoted. The raw truth is that we paid tuition and we're paying rent; to pay this enormous some to have to take classes and be at home is an enormous front on whatever it even means to have a college education. Moreover, it's also a Professor's duty to protect himself or herself; this idea of "we can't go outside because an old person might get it" is healing this massive social responsibility onto the young. Social distancing should be practiced, for sure, and the elderly should be protected, for sure - at the same time, if Johnny decides he wants to grab a pizza or go to the gym, it's not his duty to protect Lisa the 60 year old accountant. Lisa also has to stay at home, protect herself, order groceries from online, etc. We can't expect Johnny to avoid all contact with everyone and move home forever - there's a responsibility for both parties here!

1. Asymptomatic people are contagious. 2. First confirmed case in VA was barely 10 days ago. With incubation of 14 days and already a rise this quickly should tell you these numbers will go up. A lot.

It appears that the state health officials overstated how prepared they were, that being said, I feel like the post you mentioned might have had a different response if they had went through their insurer or said they were exhibiting symptoms. I understand that there are some people who are asymptomatic, but among the people who are exhibiting symptoms few of the tests come back positive. If by chance you do end up exhibiting symptoms its a matter of isolating yourself for a couple of days and treating it as you would a cold. I get why people are choosing to stay home, but if you plan on social distancing it shouldn't make a difference where.

Wanted to share my video of the final song at the Metallica concert Honestly the best concert I’ve been to so far, the crowd was amazing and I’m soooo glad I went

It was a fantastic show, and being in Lane for made it more incredible.

I live so close to Lane Stadium that I could hear it from my front porch. Pretty cool 😆

So cool! One of the few times recording is completely understandable lol

Everyone I know who went said they enjoyed it! I am glad you got to attend.

Incredible. Glad you got to experience it!

Amazing! Thanks for sharing! I've watched several versions of this today and am still enjoying every single one! :-D

Lmao I see myself in this footage https://preview.redd.it/r6flh9yqknze1.jpeg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=abf7f5a5ab1b01a401fd7b16316850bb88b46559

Epic for Metallica and the VT students and fans. 🤟🤟🤟

Epic ending to a concert!! One of the best I've experienced, and I've been going to shows for longer than I care to admit. 🤘😝🤘 My only wish was that somebody (James, Lars, Kirk, Robert ... one of them) would've given a much deserved shout-out to the Class of 2025.

So cool! Glad you posted it

I know that concert was stinky

I could hear it from a porch in Maple Ridge! So fun but hope yall wore hearing protection

As an audio guy I'm really really impressed at both the PA and the phone mic.

I didn’t think so at all, but I’ve been anime cons during a heatwave so I’ve been in worst scenarios 🫠

What’s crazy to me is they were not selling earplugs at any of the merch booths. It was insanely loud.

It wasn’t too bad. My kids got a kick out of it 🙂

I kinda forgot to even consider ear protection so my hearing was a bit weird at the end of the night but honestly still totally worth it to me

It wasn’t that bad comparatively to other concerts. Hearing protection still recommended obviously but it was so much better than other stuff I’ve been to.

I brought my own earplugs, but my friends who didn't managed to get some for free somewhere. We were on the field.

This show was pretty darn loud, I agree. But hey, if you ever do want loud-loud and haven't already, attend either a Def Leppard, Journey, or Dinosaur Jr. show. They'll blow your eardrums and leave your ears ringing for a few days!! 😄

Fall 2019, freshman year, happy times :)

I miss going to DX at 1am in the 30 degree weather

It seems just like yesterday, but also like 10 years ago.

Ah the before times

I hope we get a real fall this year. Last yeas seemed to last about 3 days and then it was cold

The trees on campus are on another level. Miss them.

I miss 2019

Great picture! Nothing like a VT fall to make you miss having seasons.

Feel for y’all. It’s a great place. Hopefully all of this is over soon.

Main egg <3 I lived there back when it was an all girls dorm

I used to love walking by Hanh and Davidson in that stretch of sidewalk. The trees kind of canopy in October and change colors before the leaves fall off. Good times.

I miss main egg! What was the date of this photo? Want to do one of the hikes when they all look like this

I don't miss being forced to wait outside DX at 3am after it closed in 7 degree weather because some idiot can't cook.

picture this: it’s 1:45 am on a brisk saturday morning. you’re baked out of your mind in your dorm. The munchies hit you. You look at the clock and say to yourself “fuck DX is closing soon”. You put on your jacket and walk hastily to DX to pick up corn dog nuggets, a pizza, and a peace tea. You get back to your dorm where your roommate is waiting for you with Super Smash Bro’s loaded on his switch. He says to you, “Wanna smash, bro?”. Life is good.

I do that all the time, currently a sophomore

I honestly read it as 2009, which was my freshman year, and definitely brought back some memories.

BC (Before Coronavirus)

Yeah that’s exactly what it felt like

Hopefully, we’ve had more rain this year compared to last year. That really makes a difference.

19th October !

You ever get 3 in one night?

~~Would you like to speak to the manager?~~

Trust me all it ever fucking does it rain

Oh sorry I wasn't referring to the DX people can't cook I meant someone in the dorms can't cook and caused a fire alarn.

DX is honestly better than they have any right to be. I miss the breakfast sandwiches

Ah ok, miscommunication. Happy to withdraw my sarcastic jab.

Breakfast sandwhiches at DX were litttt

I mean I would like to speak to an RA

Did anyone notice this? Is it related to magnetic storm?

This is indeed the Northern Lights, and is due to the solar storm.

[Could be Northern lights](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/maps-northern-lights-forecast-us-aurora-borealis/)

is it still happening?

That's so cool. Good luck to me in the middle of town trying to see anything.

Where are they visible?? I’m just visiting town for graduation, and can’t see them near my hotel…

For anyone that’s wanting to see the lights, you’ll have to get out of town proper and head away from the light pollution. Rain clouds are overhead for the next half hour or so. Hopefully they clear with enough time to still catch the tail end of the lights.

Hi. This is caused by charged particles from the sun called coronal mass ejections interacting with Earth’s magnetic field.

Yo, where this @? Trying to find places without light pollution rn is proving Hella difficult

Should be happening tonight to due to the crazy number of solar flares and cmes the past few days

Yes. I work on a space weather satellite for NOAA. The lead scientist that I work with told me the other day that it would likely be visible from many parts of the world (and it was).

Yes! I think they’ll keep going to a hour or so after midnight. You’ll want to be in a low light area, let your eyes adjust for a bit, and wait for any clouds to pass by. Also your phone will pick up more of the light than your eyes will.

You could go to the rear pavilions at heritage park, it gets pretty rural pretty quick, and it’s only 10ish minutes from campus. There weather isn’t great right now, but if it clears up I think you could find a good spot somewhere around there.

I was on a huge hill in Christiansburg and Blacksburg looks like a spotlight behind the mountain.

There’s a very unfortunate amount of cloud coverage right now, which is probably why you can’t see them. I’m going to stay up a few more hours and hope they pass. They were pretty cool when I got to see them around 10pm

You can use [this map](https://www.lightpollutionmap.info/#zoom=7.11&lat=37.6708&lon=-80.4555&state=eyJiYXNlbWFwIjoiTGF5ZXJCaW5nUm9hZCIsIm92ZXJsYXkiOiJ3YV8yMDE1Iiwib3ZlcmxheWNvbG9yIjpmYWxzZSwib3ZlcmxheW9wYWNpdHkiOjYwLCJmZWF0dXJlc29wYWNpdHkiOjg1fQ==) to help you find a darker area

where’d you find out it’d last till 1?

thanks! heading rn

campus seems terrible so i’m heading here

Also I was able to see them in a neighborhood with no street lights

https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/05/10/northern-lights-aurora-when-time/73638964007/ I’m definitely not an expert on this, I just got lucky that I looked outside at 10pm. It seems like the show is over now though, I can’t see anything anymore. I’ve seen some websites that said the lights might be visible Saturday night also, but idk. I’ll be looking tomorrow night, and if you didn’t get to see them tonight, I wish you luck

thanks man! I just arrived on foot just in case it’d start again, is it blue or is that just light pollution?

My guess is light pollution, it was green and magenta when I saw it. There was definitely a bit of light pollution where I was, but it was still able to shine through. I really hope you get to see it!

i think imma pack it up for tonight it’s spooky af out here, any idea when it starts tomorrow?

I’m not 100% sure it’ll happen again tomorrow, but I’m going to keep an eye out around 10, that’s when I was able to see them today

damn okay well lmk if it does

i just checked the 30 min forecasts and it seems like around 8 pm was by far the most visible time for us

Visited my freshman cadet son over the weekend... We saw Hokie football, Hokie hockey, and got a grand tour of the campus. I gotta say, VT has just a stunning campus. What a fantastic visit. We're from the Memphis area, but I will say that we are falling in love with the Blacksburg area. https://preview.redd.it/e0144e57ncxb1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=181ee9cdd3a99619f70cdf862ba61d2df9b7cdd2 https://preview.redd.it/uninub87ncxb1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=216f10d643020fa92d3bccf10ed85f958ab30bdd https://preview.redd.it/fg5mw397ncxb1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0446994a9961b7c7abfcfd00c0d1e2876c5ab28b https://preview.redd.it/x3hi4t27ncxb1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=97c8bcb763babf37a5fe16732da5cc7a9feff508 https://preview.redd.it/v1wcq737ncxb1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ed44c02511615f600ed645b48e401b1ee6f2de48 https://preview.redd.it/5ayjg667ncxb1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f0f411062a590061acd93e57694040c819ff0a87 https://preview.redd.it/ztfv9d27ncxb1.jpg?width=1816&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=76e2d5db9e976efe0d409ad94edfc6c88d41fd7f https://preview.redd.it/5s1n0797ncxb1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f58b3a5098c834168910c9ec732185a24f8f78d0 https://preview.redd.it/5ucct7a7ncxb1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0ed38aac8b6b150ca4684e31208468e80ae4ee48 https://preview.redd.it/3c6v9v47ncxb1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c3d89c04eb71d45ff6e60da7add178317cc7eb5a https://preview.redd.it/or8kjd67ncxb1.jpg?width=1816&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=aaeaaeade5479ad1651d755ab155a07bde5fcab8 https://preview.redd.it/i2eaqk57ncxb1.jpg?width=1816&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=da52b164f48527d2d604a90ea085d30485e3970e https://preview.redd.it/s0f71e97ncxb1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a5b8831516f2cc07f3312c48f79cb16e36c4e122 https://preview.redd.it/uzhy6067ncxb1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3e53d0c96a4ab29c5da818b17c58a596e7feaddc

Nice looking photos!

My last fall in Blacksburg was 6 years ago. This is making me miss it bad <3

Glad you enjoyed! As a former cadet myself, I can say your son will get a unique insight into VT and it's history as well as be a part of it.

As a current cadet, encourage your son to stick it out. I sent the emails to drop after New Cadet week, and my father drove 2.5 hours down out of the blue to encourage me to stay and stick out the year. So glad he did. Sticking with it is top 5 best decisions I’ve ever made

Fall is certainly the most beautiful time of year in Blacksburg.

Very nice photos!

Wow these photos are amazing!

Thanks for sharing these…..nice pics

It's not cloudy and raining. I don't believe you.

The campus has always looked so “majestic” to me …the fall colors come this time of year. It’s all so beautiful

As a cadet alumni, it makes me happy to see families sharing the same experience my family and I had. My folks had season tickets and drove from Pittsburgh for all the games. So many good times spent together.

Graduated May 2017, still miss it 💕 Great pics!

Where is the ice skating place?

hi fellow tennessean! i’m from the Nashville area :) it’s beautiful here

wait this made me miss it :(((( -class of 2021

Don’t forget Montgomery county being Lymes disease capital..

lol this isnt facebook

Me too. Then I remember it's followed by winter.... 🥶❄️

He's definitely in it for the long haul. Of course he rolls his eyes at the BS (both me and his mother are ex-USAF, so at least we have been able to provide some wisdom into the tactics of military training), but he doesn't hate it. Our biggest message is for him to remember that none of the yelling and punishments/revoking of privileges is personal...it's just part of the process. He's there on a full-ride USAF ROTC scholarship so he really can't quit, but he chose the Corps of Cadets and VT over every other school with a USAF ROTC program knowing full well that it would be challenging. I honestly think that's what he wanted: The challenge. And now that he's in White Phase, he still rolls his eyes at the BS, but at least he can left face while dragging in the dorms now, lol. We constantly encourage him and send him positive messages (and boxes of food and other assorted goodies.)

Good for you!

I wish...just a lowly Galaxy S21 with a clean lens.

Reddit moment

Glad to hear. As someone who is prior enlisted, I have so much more respect for someone who chooses an SMC like VT over some place like JMU. Most ROTCs just play Army dress up once a week, SMCs like here you willingly submit yourself to humiliation. The BS here is not much different from what enlisted go through at basic. Very glad to have him here. What company is he ratting?

He's Lima Company. And yeah, my wife and I are both prior enlisted (me: USAF 90-97, her: USAF 92-95) and some of the stuff he's told us they had him doing made us laugh - like, yep...sounds about right for BMT. We also told him that once he gets his commission, he'll be in a different world as far as how he is treated vs. enlisted folks.

Lol sometimes I miss freshmen year just cause of the crazy dumb stuff we had to do. Sucks in the moment but it forms great memories and lifelong friendships. Im in Charlie so will probably never run into him but will keep my eyes open

Obviously, this is being done so SB doesn't become a universal superspreader event. That being said - Just cancel SB and end the semester early. The scattered days off might work on paper but it's just an incredibly lame, tone-deaf reaction to public pressure. GO HOKIES!

Absolute bullshit and I’m not even a student at tech yet.

What if everyone protested or signed a petition or something

High quality meme here

Honestly, I'd rather just not have spring break and have classes end one week early or start one week late

That’s what I’m saying...it’s a decision we’ll see at colleges across the country for safety, but they’re trying to pretend that the five random days off are equivalent to one straight week off.

I don’t think they realize that most classes can be completed anywhere since they are mostly online. I know people who travel regularly between Bburg and other areas. Splitting it up so people don’t travel won’t do anything, people already travel.

You can still catch covid walking outside in Blacksburg, cancelling a week off won’t stop covid from existing

Don’t fall into the trap fam

http://chng.it/LMPdk4mGhB here’s the change.org petition

Yeah cus signing petitions always work... smh

It’s so stupid especially since teachers still feel the need to assign work due on those random days off

Guess the thought is people might not party for a solid week at a beach town if they have classes all week. Bad idea altogether.

I bet a ton of colleges will do this or just cancel SB all together.

Yeah. That’s not going to happen. Everyone has been cancelling spring break. Most aren’t giving the extra days off during semester at all. This is a covid thing not a “tech trying to intentionally piss people off” thing.

Let's stop posting change . Org bogus acting as if it has ever done anything at all lol

...and here's another: https://www.change.org/p/tim-sands-reinstate-spring-break-at-virginia-tech

plenty of colleges have already cancelled. Most are appending "spring break" to winter break or ending the semester early. Anyone who thought there would be a normal spring break this year was delusional.

Uh, are they ever trying to intentionally piss people off?

Even from a COVID perspective it’s a fucking stupid ass decision

Email the board of visitors secretary, BOV student reps, sands, and Shushok yourselves. That’s what I did. One student rep replied. Nobody else so far.

Nah. People just act like they’re doing it to intentionally hurt students. Was more meaning this is a circumstance of trying to do the most with a terrible situation. Have to do random 5 days because of things like labs because if you miss 5 mondays or fridays you’re missing like 5 weeks of some classes etc

Why is it stupid from a COVID perspective?

Every student who is willing to travel during a pandemic is going to do so regardless of a scheduled break or not, seeing as classes can be attended virtually from anywhere at the moment. Guarantee we’ll see plenty attending classes from a beach for a week during spring. And additionally, why the hell are half the days in the middle of the week? At LEAST make them on fridays so we get a long weekend. There’s ZERO reason to make those days in the middle of the fucking week. So no matter how you slice it, it’s stupid. Furthermore, and this is a personal reason, I need my spring break to help with spring harvest on my family’s farm. If I don’t we stand to lose the whole place, and thus I’d have to drop out of college. So again, stupid decision from every angle.

Because the more long weekends the more travel which is exactly what they're trying to prevent.

Props to the HOKIE fans representing in Seattle!!!!

Such a good team. Also gave me a heart attack when they got it to within one. I've been traumatized from watching VT FB and MBB

Congrats. Also they are lucky that they won’t encounter USC until the finals.

I think you mean USC is lucky they won’t have to face VT until the finals

This is hilarious, great meme.

So did my high school, and like UVA nobody cared except our principal who had the lights on 24/7

I don’t even know what that is

I mean I'm no Hoo but rotundas are pretty neat

It's a room with an elliptical (ovular) shape. The cool thing about it is that the elliptical shape makes it so if two people are standing on opposite sides of the room, person A can whisper and person B can still hear it. The bad thing about rotundas are that it's more examples when you have to study conics.

Zoom University Meme #479

Yep, class averages on quizzes have gotten suspiciously higher

Cheat with no possible way of getting caught or don't cheat and fail an exam. Hmmm

I like to call it “using your resources”

Deforms would be the absolute worst! Multiple choice A-J. 15 questions and I got J None of the Above for 7 of them

The same thing happened in one of my classes with 20% attendance quizzes at 8am which pissed me off cause it was an easy A type class. A lot of people got good grades by cheating but one person got honor coded after reentering the quiz. Not worth it IMO.

I get your point, but at the same time, so many professors make the exams harder to compensate for cheating. In that way they're almost encouraging it. The students are such between a rock and a hard place.

2 computers = 1 on the test, 1 on chegg

Test averages seem to be lower for my classes.

As a grad, know that it'll make a difference eventually. I know the capable and the honest around me. Stay strong.

A lot of the standard closed book midterms have now become open book so of course the avg is going to be higher.

I've long graduated, but I admire this mindset. I would rather fail with integrity than cheat my way through. &#x200B; It usually sucks, but it did pay off that one time when over half the class went to honor court because they copied the solutions manual verbatim and there was a mistake in the solution. The first class after this happened was crazy, it was a bloodbath, they moved the class to a smaller room.

People complain to professors (I am one... not at VT, but I'm an alum) about many things, but they really should complain about this.

You sound like an honest and respectable human with good morals; have you considered graduate school? Join us at /r/VTGrads

Hmmmmm, is it cheating or people devoting more time and effort into work because they are more motivated?

I took that last semester and it was hard enough in person. It sucks for everyone that has to take intro + other cs classes online.

Is lindah kotut the prof for that class?

My economics class taught me something about game theory... If only I had studied and could remember what it was...

respondus monitor though ?

Or I mean, do what you would normally do and study and don't fail. This is a weird dichotomy you made.

A big part of life is maximizing success while mitigating risk. You should try your best to learn the content because that's what you're at college for. That being said, if you've actually put an effort in and still don't understand, I see nothing wrong with using whatever resources you have at your disposal as long as there's no risk to it. I've never understood taking the moral high ground in OPs situation if there's only positive consequences to not. Clearly OP didn't understand the content. Failing with integrity isn't going to teach them anything. Warm and fuzzies are nice if you understand the content.

Sounds like a Hendricks test.

What’s reentering the quiz

Have you ever heard faculty share that sentiment? Just because the exam is hard to you, doesn't mean it's been made harder than in the past, and certainly doesn't mean the instructor is doing it to "compensate for cheating." This is a dangerous (convenient) false narrative.

Until you make a mistake with something on chegg. Prof slightly modifies a problem - or the prof plants a problem on chegg that is wrong. See you in honor court.

Curious, what happened with those who were honor courted? How do they handle that many students?

Yeah, we're not psychic. Many profs probably won't know that this is happening if we don't get told. It's really hard to know what happens on the student side. It's amazing how often I see the student side of canvas now and it's like, woah wait it looks like that? Where is X? Little things make differences, let alone secret cheating cabals.

Why not both?

The original post says "get a 24%", I was responding to that.

Well, getting yourself to a situation in the future where you can't do stuff, because you brute forced your way through earlier classes, that really sucks for everyone. I have students this semester in advanced CS classes who clearly can't do basic stuff (e.g., for loops, instantiating instances), and it's not fun. They got through earlier classes via hooks and crooks, and now they have to deal with failing my class. Sad as a teacher.

Thangjitham. I think he retired but he had to be one of the lowest rated professors in the engineering department. He used to be the department head for mechanics of materials. He wrote the final for decades but enough people petitioned to have all the professors share questions.

We had an attendance quiz with a password displayed til 8:01am

Clearly you check the numbers and if they’re off use the steps

I believe they all got an F for the course. This was like a 70 person class, they couldn’t exactly expel everyone.

“Press X to doubt”

Why not Zoidberg?

Yea I have her for 1114 too. That test was a nightmare haha. Can’t wait to rip em during the SPOT survey

What's your perspective on it as a professor? To me, it's just indicative they aren't cut out for a CS degree (or anything requiring it). It's their future on the line. They may just be kids, but they're old enough to decide to waste $80k+. Any company with a half-decent recruiting process will run the other way. There's a difference between students in, let's say Architecture, *using their resources* to pass a music theory class and students in Engineering *using their resources* to pass calculus. I don't personally partake in such things (my poor excuse of a degree is easy enough already), but I empathize with people who do.

I think you missed, friend

I’m not honestly not sure what you mean by that

Double the monitors, double the score!

Broooo 1114 was so hard in person GG

It's complicated, and half the time I think you need to look at the assessment as being garbage. Making exams is hard and most profs aren't trained for it. They just cobble something together the night before they administer it. Most of the time in industry, you can Google stuff and experiment and get advice from others. When students can achieve things with help, that isn't necessarily a bad thing. The problem with cheating is when you don't really know anything at the end of it and couldn't have solved it without hiring someone else. I guess my take is that my usual job is filtering out the students who truly don't get it after a semester, and otherwise to provide as many opportunities for them to practice and experiment and just put in hours with the material. Lotta evidence seems to suggest it takes a long time for people to "get" coding, and it's unlikely to land for most people after just a few months of rushed instruction. We need to manage our expectations and recognize that everyone's progressing in their own way and rate. I have more thoughts but I'm tired and haven't finished my project spec. The real story this semester is that as brutal as it is for students, it's been equally brutal for many of us faculty. I've pulled a lot of all nighters and it's still been a terrible learning experience for my students :/

I did. I deleted it. Meant to reply below you. But I agree with this comment wholeheartedly as well

They typed the password in after putting in once I believe.

If they're going to be entirely ignored, what's the point of having them? For the lone instructor or two that want feedback anyway?

My last one. This one goes out to all my fellow Hokies.

This makes me sad for all the great foods that I haven't had since I graduated :(

who else here miss Homeplace?…

This photo reminds me of a little fast food Italian place that was near/in Christiansburg back in the late 90s that served up endless breadsticks. I can’t remember the name but it was cheap and mediocre, so exactly what I needed as a college kid. I have vivid memories of being amazed and disgusted by how many times you could squeeze the same breadstick with a napkin and have it completely soaked in grease. Glad to see you guys have better eating options these days. 😊

Damn that actually kinda looks good where is that from

The younger people might now believe this, but in the 80s, the dining hall food sucked. They served this fish all the time called scrod, and it was gross like most things. I ate on Owens for two years. Glad to hear you all get good food now.👍🏼

Flush twice... It is (was) a long way to Schultz.

Someone eat a hokie club for me!

Nothing better than chicken parm day

GO CHOKIES!! lol...seriously...don't choke...looks tasty

Origami hibachi 😩

The giant fucking cheap salads at Leaf & Ladle - I still think about what a perfect lunch they were.

Maybe absence makes the heart grow fonder bc I’m ending my freshman year and hope to never eat this food again 😭😭

do you not go to restaurants? lmao

If you miss Homeplace and are still in the area, you should check out Blacksburg Tavern

Fazoli’s! Loved that place.

I moved there in 2008 from California and had never seen a Faziolis. I literally called home to tell them about the cheap portions of spaghetti and unlimited bread sticks. No one was impressed, but I was sold.

Fazoli’s was the bomb!

Fazolis is a national chain and is still around some parts

Its not good at all

Or “Manager’s Choice” on Friday’s, where they cleared out the freezers and made a horrible mashup. I confirmed this with my landlord, who was a manager/director at Dietrich in the 80’s and 90’s.

I remembered the turkey tetrazini that we used to call turkey tetrachloride.

We haven’t had the club for two years. Covid ruined that. Hopefully to bring it back next year.

Yes! That’s it!

They are opening one in Pulaski soon I think!

Owens wasn't serving anything like that 12 years ago.

Listen here you little shit /s

It’s not that bad tho

I saw that too. The former Shoney's building.

Yes it was. I lived in Newman in 2010 and the pasta place slapped every day, especially chick Parm day

They had those bomb burritos though

Def did I remember having to serve too many chicken parms lmao, they're still using the exact same DELICIOUS bread rolls HNNGH

It wasn't thirty years ago, that's for damn sure.

That was my senior year so I didn't eat on campus all that often, maybe they had stepped out up some. I was more of a west end guy.

I was a big special teams guy. But it’s unforgivable what they did to my boy: the flips spicy chicken sandwich

I think I ate like 50 of those per semester and I’m not ashamed of it.

The spicy chicken sandwich?

Oh yea. How could I not, when it had a separate line that was way shorter than anything else? Best thing to get when you were in a rush. Two of those was a lunch for kings.

Where's the staff collecting the penis tax?

I can smell this picture.

Purveyors of the Rail, of which I have only hazy memories.

Least used Pepsi machine in history

So did they change the entrance?

If those stairs could talk...

"More experienced" Hokies will remember that as Neily's Bookstore, a competitor to the on-campus bookstore (that was in the basement of Owen's until the new building was built).

That single parking meter is like a menacing harbinger of things to come.

ha showed this to my father '87 grad he had a good chuckle

Wow the paint scheme is so much better

Keep this going. I like this.

[TOTS wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_of_the_Stairs)

In the 80s a guy named Thor owned the bar. He looked a Thor. His thighs must have bee 30 inches in circumference.

It was “The Balcony” for a while in the late 80’s, early 90’s.

Where are you finding these?! Family photos?! 😎

OH THE BALCONY - was there 91-95 and yes spent every Friday there for some beers!!!!

Where's the railing that I've seen 10 people puke over?

But they charge everyone?

Where the railing I've seen 10 people puke over?

A potpurri of stale beer, moldy wood, and foot odor.

Those bathroom troughs......effervescent

No Rail that I recall back then....just beer on tap. And the drinking age was 18!

It almost looks to me like the stairs in this picture could be the stairs that are now on the inside that lead down into that pit area. I could be wrong though

Yeah the stairs go up the front to an entrance where that left window is in the pic.

Now, you are going way back! When was the on-campus bookstore built? My mom, class of '64, told me she lived in an apartment house that stood where the bookstore is now that they converted for use as a girls dorm when the population of women at VT outgrew Hillcrest.

Drove through Blacksburg in the 90s and it was The Balcony....but it was TOTS before and after.

OH THE BALCONY - was there 91-95 and yes spent every Friday there for some beers!!!!

Right, and the script lettering of the sign looked more like "Baloney"

Photo album my girlfriend made me before graduation. We met at the bottom of the stairs in TOTS. Ended marrying her. 🥰

These were days when Blacksburg and VT had way more hippies and ag student types. Totally different than the last 15 years!!!!

Entrance has changed since it opened. The viewpoint of this picture is from the courtyard across College Avenue by Squires Student Center.

Maybe. That doorway I think is the first door out to the deck and the back bar

The Extension Division Apartments (per an older campus map). The building was vacant in the early '70s and burned down. The new bookstore was built on the site and opened in the mid '70s.

OH THE BALCONY - was there 91-95 and yes spent every Friday there for some beers!!!!

Aww! Congratulations ☺️

Yeah the more I look at it I think that this staircase is probably gone and the deck is in its place now. The pit area is further back

I really have too much time on my hands without any classes...

You're too late! I already joined the facebook group "Storm R. Kelly, he can't pee on all of us!".

We townies stand ready to protect Blacksburg and its assets.

They literally did accept everyone woooooow

This needs to quickly become a thing. Let's flood the drill field and deploy ships there. With a strong navy in the heart of the school theyd be forced to surrender. I'd they decide to fight let's send reinforcements on land and air(drones courtesy amazon). Let's do this.

Yea! But go tech anyway!

What assets lmao - as a fellow townie

And as you stand on the drill field it will turn into a sink hole and you’ll all fall in because the drill field is slowly sinking

Been a pry defender, but it’s time for change

Yeah and Whit goes too… I don’t hate everything Whit did, bball and baseball/softball under his tenure have achieved a lot in school history. HOWEVER, football is king and absolutely no AD can hire a third football coached after the first two got fired. Let’s move on!

That Vanderbilt coach looks pretty good. He costs a million less a year too!

I've been willing to give Pry until JMU next year, but after tonight I think it's time.

1st year was a wash, whatever it's a new HC and a rebuilding season. When we went on a hot streak and finished our year beating UVA and Tulane in a bowl game I was pleasantly surprised and optimistic for the next year as 21/22 starters were returning. Then 6-7 was asinine for being a supposed CFP Dark Horse going into the season. This 0-2 start is fucking indefensible and Babcock and Pry need to be fired out of Skipper into the sun.

Was gonna say, maybe we can donate some Home Depot boxes for packing the office

VT football is dead. No matter what we do we will be relegated to the big 12 at best when the acc blows up in a few years. Its over. They will never be good again. Cherish the beamer years but we are done. The university doesn't take football seriously enough and will never invest enough to really be a contender. They squandered the success of the past and didn't build onto it. Fuente was a bust. Pry is a bust. The next moron to millionaire we hire will be a bust. Enjoy your lives, enjoy the campus, get your degree and make a good living. God bless and goodnight

I’m really hoping VT does what it’s fully capable of doing and destroys ODU next weekend. A loss there would be beyond embarrassing. So far I can’t blame people for being frustrated with the utter and complete stagnation but genuine backsliding I think would send a very clear message about the program and a need for some serious retooling.

I wanted him to work out so badly, he started when I started tech and it appears he’ll be leaving when I graduate…but I genuinely will be so happy the day he leaves

Same. I was a Pry supporter until about 10pm last night. I’ve met him and seems like a great guy. Just lacking in some fundamentals in football as a HC

Are there any other Beamers available for hire?

Beat ODU. Beat Wofford and NC State. If anything but 3-2 after Wolfpack. Buh bye

Gramblin just got paid ONE MILLION to lose 70-0 to Ohio State.. If we're gonna lose, get PAID

They should start looking at options but keep Pry until they find a good replacement.

Got your wish...Fired! Now what?

VT, where did all the money go?

Va Tech should offer the head football coaching job to Jimbo Fisher. His record is an amazing 128 & 48. Zero scandals. And he left A&M with $77 Million in his pocket. He is from West Va and loves the ACC. Va Tech boosters have raised $48 Million. If we need more money and office space, I would offer that of Whit Babcock, Tim Sands, Charles Phlegar, and Coach Pry. They have dug a big enough hole putting Va Tech at the bottom of the ACC in revenue even though the fans have packed Lane Stadium for years, and the boosters have done a wonderful job of fund raising. Finally, I would invite the Board of Visitors to visit somewhere else, but not ever in Blacksburg again. Follow this recipe, and I’ll see you at the top! Go Hokies!!!

As a taxpayer in Va I’m pissed off. Only Clemson & Fla State have larger college football stadiums in the ACC than Va Tech. And loyal Hokie fans have been packing Lane Stadium for years. The boosters are kicking in nearly $50 Million. Yet VT is at the bottom of the conference on spending for athletics. Where is our money going?

So Whit Babcocks’ last 2 mistakes; Fuente & Pry; is costing VT nearly $15 Million. And Babcock is still drawing a paycheck at VT? A number of heads should roll in Blacksburg. The VT fans deserve so much better than what they are getting from the high paid figureheads at VT. Also, the Board of Visitors are totally clueless.

I had been defending whit but yeah he’s gotta go

Yep, Whit has done absolutely nothing during his tenure to improve the state of the football program. And failed to even maintain the level it was when he first arrived, which wasn't a particularly high bar.

Beamer is the problem. If Frank had stepped aside for Shane 8 years ago none of this horror movie happens

Jerry Kill is the brains behind Vanderbilt.

Let’s poach him lol

We can’t risk that, jmu already thinks they are better

> Cherish the beamer years but we are done. The university doesn't take football seriously enough Seriously? This is the problem. We want Beamer. We don’t change Vt mentality today is the same as it was in 2010 and 2015 and 2025 We didn’t change. Its now been 15 years, VT on the edge of its 2nd National Championship game The 2011 season was the year it all showed on the field 20th-ranked Tigers scored 21 points in the third quarter to beat No. 3 Virginia Tech 38-10 to win their first ACC Championship in 20 years. * Virginia Tech has won seven consecutive games and Clemson has lost two in a row and three of its last four. * Spread: Virginia Tech -7 * Expect turnovers and pressure to be the difference. Clemson has only forced two turnovers in its last four games and none in its last three. Meanwhile, Virginia Tech has committed four turnovers since its last meeting with Clemson and is +7 in those games. Hokies Win If: They get pressure on Boyd and force turnovers. Tigers Win If: The team from the first eight games shows up. >“We’re a championship program and tonight we added to a great tradition,” Clemson Head Coach Dabo Swinney said. * Clemson football team since that game, has won two national championships (2016 and 2018) six ACC championships and appeared in four national championship games and a record-setting 12 consecutive seasons with at least 10 wins and, with additional title appearances in 2015 and 2019. We were better than Clemson, you can't say they had any advantage over us. Dabo did what Beamer did not do and changed a Program And we still want to see vt as Beamerball

This is so depressing 😞

As a husker fan I feel ya. We had 2 bad busts in a row from Mike Riley to Scott Frost- 8 years of losing football. We are just now scratching and clawing our way back to respectable football. Tech can and will do the same

Should we hope for an L if it will spur real change?

How's ODUs defensive line? Because we know our OL is in big trouble

Now we find a coach looking for a job, or poach one

Depends on what your goal is. You could argue the success of the Vick / Tyrod era boosted student interest and applicants and raised the general caliber of students.

Shane wasn’t ready to be a HC in P4. Plus he said he didn’t want it and be in his Dad’s shadow.

Kill is a football savant and incredibly underrated. Our football team collapsed when he left.

Ain’t no way we can poach him. We don’t have that swagger anymore

Thinks? They are better 😂😂

So…Beamer built a program, Dabo changed one. Big difference. Before Beamer there was really no fame with VTs football program. Even in Virginia, nothing more than like VMI.

Class of 01 here, my wife bought a VT flag and I begged her to keep it in the garage.

At least Nebraska is in a real conference.

If VT can’t handle a B-list Sunbelt team that even JMU typically beats the breaks off of we’re in some SERIOUS trouble. I did my undergrad at JMU and I remember beating them a lot. VT’s an ACC team that’s one of the big four conferences Sunbelt teams shouldn’t be a concern in the slightest.

Supposedly Fu and Kill had some kind of falling out that led to Kill leaving. If so yet another black mark in Fu’s record

Especially after what we saw tonight

Big swing and a miss 1962-1968 Total Record: 41-29-1 1969-1975 Total Record: 34-40-1 1976-1982 Total Record: 45-33-1 1983-1989 Total Record: 49-28-2 1990-1996 Total Record: 52-29-2 1997-2003 Total Record: 64-22-0 2004-2010 Total Record: 72-21-0 2011-2017 Total Record: 58-32-0 2018-2024 Total Record: 40-42-0 But way to stick to the script on VT, Still wanting to think of Beamer. Still don’t change That lack of change is the problem. Back around 2008 - 2012, Clemson Football and VT Football were equals to the Fans at VT. No one cared about being equals with UVA and ODU ----- * Thats half the issue the last 10 years We had the same fan base and revenue and size. Clemson changed to win

Just tired of sucking and mediocrity

You're new here. We've struggled with ODU. We're 3-2 in the last 5 matchups

Yea, winning fixes everything. When you're on a losing streak that coincides with the massive changes required to compete in today's NCAA it's no wonder you fall behind. I used to think VT was always ahead of the curve, but now I feel like we are doing nothing but reacting... too little, too late.

Yep. The problem is VT got bad at the worst possible time. Clemson and other programs got good at the right time and can ride winning into more winning under the new portal and NIL system.

In case you're wondering about housing

Don’t be ridiculous, the White House is way too far to commute to campus. You’d get stuck on 81S for hours!

Traci Cook’ed with that one ngl

If you could show that your felony is a misdemeanor past the statute of limitations and a mystery unproven other crime then you should be fine wherever.

do not go to Foxridge, they are outrageous, they told us for a 2 bedroom it would be 1500 without utilities and close to 1900 with utilities, me and my roommate went to "The Mill" in Blacksburg, its 1.5 miles off campus, right beside the good Kroger and we are paying 1130 a month with everything but electric ($100+/-) and internet ($25-$75 depending on student plan) so much nicer place and easy commute

FoxRidge is awful. Avoid.

All you can eat hamburders!

That comment is about as funny when Joe had a leaky leak from his bum.

With the new Amtrak coming, you should be fine.

Not that much further than Foxridge tbf

I see what you did there. Nicely done.

Omg I did the same thing. They told me 1300 plus utilities in the fall and then kept jacking the price up (at one point it got to like 2000) and then I started hearing how unresponsive they were to like everything and the office at the mill was so kind to me and accommodating and answered all my questions. I signed with them this week! Excited to move!

unfortunately every company that owns apartments around blacksburg blows, foxridge was at least one of the cheaper places for being sucky while i was in school

What problems have you had? Maybe it's just because this is my first apartment so I have nothing to compare it to, but I haven't had any issues other than maybe some maintenance requests taking a while

IS IT ACTUALLY

I had a random roommate in Pritchard. Nothing will phase me anymore

And just about as old as Foxridge too, a ghostly colonial child asked for my WiFi password back in the day.

I'm glad to see others going to the mill, i have one of the bottom rooms which is one of the best in my opinion

They were cheaper but the new owners started jacking up the rent

I’d ignore; people who say avoid (no explanation) have their personal demons to hash or are just unlucky.

Yeah, by 2035….

Yes - with the new plan to have the station in Cambria, the project will move much quicker with an anticipated completion date of 2027.

damn. i guess i got lucky since i was only around for a few months when they first bought it a year or so ago. cant say im surprised tho, they charged us for their own stuff breaking in our apartment when we left.

Or maybe I know more than you but want to keep my identity protected. There’s a wild thought.

That’s as lame as your initial comment. What’s wild is you making excuses.

These green containers are reusable by the way

noooooooo who tf looks at a hard plastic container like that and just thinks "this is single use waste". this was a hard fought battle to get them in dining halls! I know there's a gross pandemic rn but make the effort yall!!

Just bring them back to any of dining halls. You don't have to waste such a good sturdy plastic.

For goodness sake, why would people do this?

I was part of the student intern group that piloted to get these on campus. We did so many tabling events and meetings with administration to prove it could work. This actually kinda hurts to see....

Upvoting to spread awareness Also i’m pretty sure if you do the reusable option you save about $.25 per order which really adds up fast.

Who sees that trash can and just piles their own crap on it? Someone is going to have to try to empty that, and it's gonna suck. Just find another.

Fun fact from one of the turner managers: people collectively took a total of 22,000 of these containers last year and never returned them

They're literally called reusable to-go containers!

Don’t they charge your account if you don’t return them?

My Freshman yeah, one of my hallmates in Miles hall would get those green containers and stack them everywhere in his room because he didn't have a roommate. At the end of the year, he had about 40 of those things, and he put them in the ceiling of his room and the 2nd floor lounge. They're probably still there

This makes me mad.

This is incredibly disheartening

The word reusable is visible on top

This is terrible!!!

Honestly asking, why are they green?? If they were clear I they’d be so much more appetizing and not as obnoxious. Plus, they are so BIG. If they were smaller they would be easier to carry around. I think that’s the reason most students don’t keep them

similar note if you turn in a container full of mold you suck and also they're going to throw it away without opening it. turn it in before it grows a friend.

I remember when they got rid of the old styrofoam to-go trays, I got one of the new style paper boxes that they had started using, I had just orders something that had a lot of moisture that compromised the box and my food went everywhere. At that moment I decided to get a couple of the reusable containers and I used those for the rest of my time at VT. The only annoying thing was the token system that they had for keeping track of them.

And you get extra tokens in case you forget yours Edit: Don't up vote, it's a lie! The tokens are dead!

Or at least take them home and reuse them.....

Human moment

Convenience. It's become programmed into society's expectations for things to be convenient as a means of increasing our productivity while maximizing comfort. Any sustainability effort that doesn't give much consideration to convenience will be a hard sell for many people. This issue basically has to be addressed by behavioral psychologists, human factors engineers, and industrial/UX designers if you want to prevent things like this.

Hey, I'm sorry fam. As someone who graduated in 2019 and used those containers religiously in my four years on campus, thanks for working so hard to get them.

Right?! There are thrash cans like every 20 feet. That’s so lame to see.

Yeah... Seriously. That trash can is well past full

The fuck do you want them to do throw it on the ground because that's what most people would end up doing instead

Not anymore, it got too complicated to manage

Well now we know where 40 of the 20000 that went missing are.

They don't have token systems anymore. As far as I know there is no track of boxes and use of boxes is based on trust now. So last year a huge amount of boxes never made it back to dining halls. I recall seeing one in YMCA.

As far as I know they don’t have a token system anymore

They used to do it that way. Pay like .50 up front and then get it back when you return it. People wouldn’t get it because of the extra fee so they tried the other way. Now you see the negative

>The fuck do you want them to do throw it on the ground Good question. Let's see if my initial comment answered that, though. >Just find another. Asked and answered, I guess.

I don't see why they just don't connect it to the hokiepassport. Deposit your tray in the machine swipe your card and have it store a digital token on your account .

They lost over 80% of boxes in the first of not keeping track of it. Edit: 85% during FY 2018-19 which equals about 20000 containers

They do use a tracking system and it uses barcodes on the boxes that scan and attach to your hokie p. If you don't return them, you do get billed for it. You also now have to pay for extra ones and I don't know if they even give you a free one anymore.

How does it work now? I thought the coin system would work okay

People arent going to go out of their way to find a trash can if the one their right next to is full

I was on the dining committee last year and this topic was discussed pretty in depth Basically it came down to the fact that students want this to be an easy to use system and adding any extra steps make lines longer. Dining services had apparently tried something where they worked with a software company or something to keep track of the containers but that ended up failing. So at that point they were like y’all are paying for it so we are gonna let it play out and if it’s unsustainable because of students then they would probably end the program. I think that there is probably something they could do make it better but I agree with their sentiment that at the end of the day it’s our responsibility.

Based on trust...

Maybe I just know better people

Why can't people just not be assholes and return them? God I hate the people on this campus sometimes...

Sounds... Efficient...

It's not just campus. This whole pandemic could be all but over here except for the people who insist on being assholes. It is our modern culture of "fuck you, I got mine."

Virginia Tech, the ACC, and Even ODU Should be Furious at ESPN The game tonight was one of the worst produced broadcasts I’ve ever seen. Microphones were grainy, sound balancing was off, no first down/line of scrimmage overlays, poor camera work, very few instant replays, and just really bad commentating. Just seemingly amateur production quality. I get that ODU Vs VT isn’t a power match up, but this level of production was something I’d expect from the CW or MASN, not a multi-billion dollar sports media conglomerate.

The game was on CW last week and it was better

This reminded me of a small town tv station covering high school football. I didn’t pay $10.99 to watch a game with the same quality as a middle school AV class production

I have a pretty insane home theater- and the game was nails on glass…

Up until the first break it sounded like one of the commentators had his mic lodged behind a tonsil.

Pretty sure since ODU hosted, their conference's TV rights had the broadcast. Which is why it was solely on streaming. Previous two times we were down there, we were on CBS Sports Network and ESPNU (i think). Huge downgrade this time. Since it was only streaming, we had to rely on ODU's in house camera crew, in their high school stadium. Blame Whit for allowing this joke of a series to continue. It's as minor league as it gets when we have to play down in norfolk.

I listened to it on the (satellite) radio, just like I used to have to do 30 years ago....it's fun to have to draw up what is happening in your head. Sorry you had to pay for that.

I watched on youtube streaming - I thought the quality was bad b/c it was pirated, not poorly produced. I've seen 1980s games on VHS with better quality. [The quality was so bad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlaiuyvYw4k) that YT didn't even cut it off like they do most pirated streamed games. GO HOKIES!

I was watching on Streameast so I thought the quality issues were just that medium

Everyone should take advantage of being able to listen to Bill Roth and Mike Burnop. They have been calling VT games since the 1990s IIRC, and you will be hard pressed to get a better take on the game. You won't have to listen to the ESPN crews mispronouncing our players names, and you'll get a healthy dose of VT history and funny stories. And then at the end of the game, you get player/coach interviews. I always mute the TV, and use another device to play audio via Bill/Mike. Yes, it's a pain when the audio doesn't match up exactly with the broadcast, but IMO it's worth the quality commentary. (I know this won't fix the other issues people had, but it would address the audio/commentary issues.)

It was ESPN+, not real ESPN. ESPN+ games are typically games that otherwise just wouldn’t have been televised, but they’ll have some people (often affiliated with the home team) throw a broadcast together. It’s cheaply done, but that’s how you get a thousand different obscure games for $11/month.

Absolute shit. I blame the ACC more than anything. I was saying 15 years ago it was a mistake for our conference HQ to be in little ole Greensboro when we have schools in Boston, Atlanta and Miami. The ACC shit the bed countless times even when FSU, Clemson and VT were national brands in a better position for ACC marketing.

Reminded me of a high school football game and the crew were just the high schoolers in the TV/broadcast club

Honestly made me lose my respect for the Sun Belt.

Ngl, I liked the commentators lol. Felt like a couple of dudes in their garage and I dug it.

💯 was texting my buddy about the horrible sound, camera work, etc. embarrassing

It was actually really hard to watch. The audio balancing was really atrocious. One announcer was too loud, one was super quiet

As a side note I know ESPN+ streams NCAA lacrosse, baseball, and softball using the host schools talent (I think the talent is usually the schools Sports Information department.) It’s one of the things I like about college sports seeing the students running cameras and splicing video. In unrelated news most schools have camera crews assigned to their sports teams. At Tech the main camera guy is allowed to go places the rest of the media isn’t. For instance, they accompany the team from locker room to the tunnel to the field on gameday. They are also in the designated player space during games which is forbidden to all other media. Very cool to watch behind the scenes. Va Tech will then go through the pictures and create a series of photographs that they then sell to fans. It’s actually a pretty lucrative money stream.

Why were the TV timeouts so long yet no commercials on ESPN+?

Looked like 5 kids filming with blackberries while being 6 beers deep. Absurd

This was the first time the ESPN+ bundle I got with Disney+ did me any damn good. So I’m not complaining. Also, I did kinda chuckle when the one guy said they gave that kid enough field to grown corn in.

It was ODU vs. VT nobody gives a shit about that game except ODU and VT fans

I couldn’t find any way to watch it other than paying 10.99 to espn+. For the price I was disappointed in the quality Anyways, vt is going to have to up the level when they start playing other acc teams like Miami, GT etc

Agree. Watched our hs game Friday night and it was on par with the production of the VT game

I feel like it’s bad every year at ODU. This year was especially bad tho

This is why you don’t play road games against a G5 team. Completely embarrassing we would even schedule this game.

It was absolutely horrible. I've seen high school games recorded with better production than this. I'm glad I get the Disney bundle for free.

I could have done better with a few hours prep with an iPhone. Was TERRIBLE.

Y'all realize that Sunbelt Conference Network produced the broadcast, right? There is no one else to blame. The ACC network has had similar problems but nothing that bad. Failing to balance the mics for the entire broadcast is unforgivable and totally amateur. A couple of film students could have done better. It's not just on the sound engineer, any and all producers that allowed that to continue for the entire broadcast should be canned.

Don’t lose to Vandy and maybe someone on earth would care about a game with ODU. Vandy is currently getting their backs blown out by Georgia State

Because of cord cutting, people are not subscribing to cable as much. This means that fewer people are forced to pay for ESPN , even though they don't watch sports. ESPN is having to deal with a new reality world where only sports fans are paying for their service. They are having to face the reality that other companies face every day and it's hard. The cost of watching games will go up and the quality of the broadcast will go down.

I made a few CW jokes last week, but this week was next level awful.

I actually thought the CW broadcast wasn’t bad. This however, was like jarringly bad.

CW brought their own helicopter and actually had some really good camera work

I actually really enjoyed the CW broadcast. The ump cam and helicopter shots of Lane were really cool.

Agree. CW has great ACC-specific sideline commentators this year. Max Browne, etc.

Espn+ is scrub crews

As someone who has done middle school productions, I'm offended :)

lol I know, at least spitting on it

Hmm I didn’t realize any team had in-house camera crews in the era of network media rights for each conference

Sunbelt is a joke. I think playing ODU is fine but we shouldn't play down there. Go play at FedEx or Charlotte if you want spectacle to impress 757 recruits.

“Joke of a series” ok sure. This is VT’s first time beating ODU in Norfolk. The program isn’t what it used to be, I witnessed that firsthand (let’s go Braxton Burmeister am I right?). Sorry to say, but this is VT’s lower end competition nowadays, and they might beat us any given week.

Same, I love listening to the radio broadcast on hokiesports network or 105.7 the bear.

did the same - couldnt bear the tv audio kinda surreal listening to the same announcers (Roth and Burnopp) that were there 35+ years ago... GO HOKIES!

No it was the broadcast itself lol

Streameast was not keeping it up for me and would skip a lot. I missed a TD. 1% network on YouTube was better but the ESPN+ source was awful. It looked like a HS media project.

Sorry but who are these guys and where do u listen to them

I believe their first season together was in 1988. I know there were there 1989.

While we have a lot of blame the ACC for, this game’s media rights were held by the Sun Belt since it was an ODU home game.

sun belt produced it because its odu home game

That’s the bigger question….do we suck so bad that even the ACC network won’t air our games?

Please have some respect. I mean it literally says please do not touch. They had trash strewn all over it.

How about you walk over and politely educate them on the meaning of the memorial instead of posting pointlessly on Reddit?

You. Don’t. Touch. The. Cenotaph.

There’s literally a ledge for them to eat at about 10 feet around that thing. I will never understand people like that.

Ugh when I was a cadet I went over there all the time to shoo trash like that from the Cenotaph. It's really sad.

I’ve gotta say, the signs are not clear in the slightest. I didn’t even know there were signs until now, I still don’t know for sure I’m just taking the commenters in this thread at their word. I’ve actually been shooed off the little darker-grey platform by a polite cadet because we had club pictures over there and there is nothing, and I mean nothing that we saw at the time saying that even the platform surrounding the monument was off limits. In fact that’s what I thought the whole point of the platform was, to stand on to view the monument. I know now to never stand on the platform, but only because a cadet had to go out of their way to tell me. I’m glad the monument is there and a culture of respect and reverence has been built around it. But we have children visiting all the time, international parents, high school students, and freshmen; we can’t expect these people to automatically know the history and culture of respect surrounding this monument without telling them. No one is trying to be disrespectful, they just don’t know any better. There should absolutely be a museum-style sign or clearer engravings that signify what can be touched and what cannot be. I don’t think it’d take anything away, Arlington isn’t any lesser for having guardrails.

I've confronted people before about it.

Hey guys can someone explain me what's happening here?

I fucking hate children.

Not meaning to be offensive, but why did they design it like that? Surely they knew this would happen all the time

Ignorant fucks

Look at the babies that can’t read

As an Virginis Tech alumnus who has the name of a relative on that memorial, I can guarantee I wouldn’t be polite to these shitheads.

They probably have no idea it’s a memorial there’s a sign that says don’t touch but it’s tiny so I don’t blame them for not seeing it

So many people in the comments acting like it’s common knowledge. No it isn’t unless you’re a cadet. You might hear about it once but it may slip your mind especially if you don’t go to the pylons often. They most likely aren’t being disrespectful or dicks they just literally don’t know. As someone who ate here all the time, the signs aren’t that obvious. Yes this happens all the time but no it’s not because people don’t care it’s because THEY DONT KNOW. So explain it to them instead of coming to the comments on some reddit post and complaining about how you’d be a dick to them or whatever. When has that ever helped anyone

Did you say anything or just post it to the internet?

Notify Timmy sands put the man on 24h guard

It's not their fault that the school thought a giant brick was a good memorial statue.

Perhaps some barrier should be installed to prevent this

i like to lick that rock late at night

Why'd they make it table shaped

But that would require human interaction

Happened to me. A polite cadet explained the importance of the memorial that I was not familiar with when I first got to campus. Never made the mistake again and told others when they did.

My first thought. Literally just walk over and introduce yourself- educate people about the significance of the ground they walk on and 99% of the time they’ll switch things up. People really need to start being more confident.

Yeah me, a graduated VT student had no idea what this was about.

Virtue signaling

I'm sorry but I didn't feel in a confrontational mood today.

It’s an honor code violation, isn’t it?

General rule of thumb, if you’re calling it a monument, stay off it.

They’re leaning on a memorial called the cenotaph that’s remembering VT alumni that ~~died serving the country~~ received the Medal of Honor. It has signs saying do not touch and what they’re doing is extremely disrespectful

Those are adults

Get off my lawn!!

And I have former classmates on there, I am 100% with you on this.

A little much, eh?

i think that’s a little much my guy

, said the giant prick.

That would detract from the site, and there are already signs stating not to be on it.

Or people should just have common sense

You can be still be polite about it, i'm sure some people don't realize why they shouldn't be standing or chilling on it

I mean, when does anyone wake up and want to have a hard conversation with strangers? It sucks, but if you feel strongly enough to post about it, say something. If nothing else, it's worth getting the practice in.

You are allowed to be in a bad mood but you should've educated them to not do that. It would've saved your time by posting this my guy.

None of these people downvoting you would have said anything either

Why is this vote manipulated? I too like to avoid drama whenever possible.

Hey sorry you are getting downvoted, that’s not fair.

the problem with society... a complete unwillingness to do what's right (unless it's on the internet where I can hide behind my screen)

Definitely not. Nobody is getting expelled over this. It's just in poor taste. Edit: Why are people downvoting me? I'm 1000% right. The honor code is about your conduct in *academic* affairs. Rudely standing on the memorial has nothing at all to do with that.

I don't believe so

I don't want your money, I got this just for youuuu. Keep your money.

That’s precious, I chuckled lol

hi drew, drew here.

Still laughing at this.

Update to my attempt to get my dog in Hokie P photo

Dog tax kiddo

Literally 1984

[not a dystopia not a dystopia](https://en.meming.world/images/en/thumb/2/2d/Living_in_1984.jpg/600px-Living_in_1984.jpg)

Damn that's ruff

I wonder how far can you stretch the self portrait rule? What if I take it myself because I set up a camera timer, would that still count?

Show us the pic you tried to use

Picture of your face with a photoshop of your dog in the reflection of your eyes. They probably won't catch that one.

I’m sorry but we need to see the pic you submitted as well.

I mean what did you expect? Good try though!

Take 10,000 pictures of your dog and use them as pixels for a self-portrait. At that resolution, no one will be the wiser. Side note, they clearly do not know what “photoshop” means.

I need you to win please

Let us see the picture you tried to submit.

Come on OP, DELIVER

This may actually be the solution! One way or another my dog is getting onto my hokie P

Wouldn’t dream of it 🤝

ITS A DYSTOPIA

Self Portrait just means a photo of yourself.

Consider the dog tax [paid in full :)](https://www.reddit.com/r/VirginiaTech/comments/uxotej/in_case_you_wanted_to_see_this_is_my_dog_that_i/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

Or a painting of yourself

You're gonna go far, but not as far as this absolute unit of a pup

After giving it much thought, I don't think it means a painting of yourself.

You’re gonna go FAR, KID

What if it’s really good?

WITH A THOUSAND LIES AND S GOOD DISGUISE

This was my instinct but didn't want to call the poor guy kid twice haha

Unfortunately, I still don't think it'll work unless it's a hyperrealistic portrait.

Lmaooo. After commenting I literally had to go listen to the song, I couldn’t resist making the comment xD

I hate college

I dont even normally have classes on friday so all the spring break day did for me was cancel office hours

One day breaks aren’t breaks when you have 3 big assignments due the next week and have to work on them everyday or take the L 😢

I'm spring broken.

i have an exam monday, and i don’t have the courage or energy to ask for the teacher to move it up

10 years later and I don’t miss college. I like doing a workday and leaving work at work (but we don’t get long breaks...just holidays and paid leave). No homework or exams. Hang in there...it gets easier especially if you’re a STEM major.

Me doing my physics lab

Having been on the outside of college for a long time I can tell you that you have not begun to learn what hate is. Good luck on your class!

Major assignments due the day before Spring Day. Major assignments due a week after Spring Day. There's no winning here, lads.

Remember when spring breaks were a week long? Hokie bird remembers...

this one really hurts lol

I am in this post and I don’t like it

Lol some teachers had office hours

Is boss better than professor ?

Living in the unit operation lab and lounge for a summer was not fun

Depends.... hit or miss. You do have the freedom to find another position if it’s bad but at the same time there’s the luck that the job isn’t too stressful every day to dread it. Especially in government or government contracting (more money usually) its 40 hours standard a week which is a decent balance of work and life. I’m not a fan of working more hours unless you’re paid for it... there’s jobs that’ll underpay your market value and want you to work 50-60 hours a week. Depends on your studies though. Engineering and CS/BIT and IT are in high demand so you have more options.

It can be. The only thing I would stress is that b work is not acceptable. Take a little longer and produce correct work.

Yeah it’s not always fun and games but you can chill with your friends in the Cellar after and appreciate the fact that you are living in Blacksburg. ChemE’s do have it tough though. You have my sympathy there.

Gotcha!!! You are correct

Uhh no you can't? There's this thing called Covid-19....

can’t even do that easily with covid

I graduated in 15

Avoid Amazon though, just heard bad things about it back then 10 years ago in college and still recently today especially as they move into Northern Virginia. Underpaid, terrible culture/slave hours. Some tips: Don’t work more than you need to unless you’re being paid by the hour and can bill it. Or you just love the job which is rare. With salary, some employers want to squeeze you a bit more each week for free work. Criticize you for leaving at the end of your hours etc. they want you to stay till 7 vs leaving at 5 avoid those. Sometimes sure during crunch times it’s needed but not every week. I had that experience at a big 4 to know that’s not what I want. 1% or less last 10 years or longer in that business culture.

Thinking of all my fellow Hokies today. Never Forget. 🧡🦃

Can’t believe its been 13 years.

I wasn’t even a student ever but Jesus Christ my heart goes out to all involved.

neVer forgeT. I need to go ride a loop around the drillfield...maybe 32 loops... Edited after...In case anyone is curious, with very light traffic, 32 laps around the drillfield takes around 1.5 hours.

We will Prevail. We are Virginia Tech. 🧡

Love you all my fellow Hokies. I cannot believe it has been 13 years.

The emotion is still raw as ever.

I still remember being on lockdown in elementary school that day even though I was only 7 years old. I don't think I've ever seen more cops swarming that place than I did that day.

So true. I’ve been trying not to cry since I woke up.

I also remember being on lockdown, I was a freshman at the highschool at the time. I'll never forget the panic of the other student trying to get in touch with their families. Teachers wouldn't tell us what was happening or anything.

Same. I remember my teacher saying that there had "been some violence down at Tech." Understatement of the year, but obviously not good to panic kids.

I remember that I had plans to wake up early to work on my thesis, but overslept that day. I opened AIM and my friend told me not to come to campus; that a police officer had came through Cowgill Hall with a large firearm asking where Norris Hall was. I remember calling both of my parents at work to tell them that I was safe, both asking from what because they had not yet seen the news. I remember being relieved that I had reached them almost immediately, as cell towers became clogged and calls were unable to get out. I remember feeling utterly helpless and not knowing what to do. I remember basically staying at my friend’s apartment for the next week endlessly watching the news because I lived by myself and did not want to be alone. I remember going to hear Nikki Giovanni and President Bush speak at Cassell Coliseum. I remember the hundreds of news vans populating the drill field, and just wanting them to leave and go away. I remember countless volunteers setting up activities to keep us engaged as one Hokie family, providing distractions or condolences and hugs if we needed it. I remember calling my parents and telling them they had to drive down and see the walls of plywood on the drill field, painted and signed by students, faculty, and community members as a makeshift memorial. I remember my thesis professor asking if we wanted to finish out the rest of the academic year and offering that she would support either decision we made. I remember deciding not to give up, to stay the course, and remain Hokie strong. I remember the solemn speeches at commencement. And, I still remember to never forget. We will prevail. We are Virginia Tech.

I overslept that day too, otherwise I would have been in the CS lab in McBryde. I didn't go to Cassell or even to the candlelight vigil cause it was all so surreal and hadn't fully set in yet at the time and I still really regret not doing those things.

Hmm, I didn’t know the president came to campus. I was only 6 when it happened, but I grew up in the area and was supposed to be at Squires taking a cello lesson that day (my teacher was a student at Tech). I never heard many details about it until much later. No one really mentioned it for years.

I had a 10:10 AM class (Real time systems) in Randolph that day, but didn't end up going after hearing the news on Q99 while on my way in (was driving from out of state).

After tonight's game

Okay, Hokies… My husband and I love that y’all have so much fun on gamedays and other special occasions. We do not begrudge you any aspect of your fun as long as you’re kind to each other, locals, and the town. Toward that end, could you maybe find it in your hearts to look for trash cans as you walk through Blacksburg? We walk downtown along the Huckleberry, Draper, Main, and Preston, and we pick up SO. MUCH. TRASH. as we go—oftentimes just feet away from a trash can. The town is good enough to provide and maintain trash cans. Could you please use them? 🙏 #ThisIsHome

Common courtesy is a luxury nowadays. Completely agree with you.

Agreed. Unfortunately its always worse after game days. I feel like a majority of college campuses in the country also struggle with this problem which is disappointing. I will never forget working in dining services during game days. One day, some dudes from either PIKE or TKE completely trashed their table before getting up and leaving. Thankfully the women they were with stayed behind to help me clean everything up and apologized profusely on their behalf. They were three sheets to the wind but sometimes I wonder how they turned out after leaving Tech. Thank you for taking the time to make our home cleaner! Takes a village and its nice knowing there are others out there doing the work.

I started picking up cans and turning them in for cash since there’s so many around 😂

We came down from PA & did a tailgate in the lions lot last weekend. MY GOD! Look in college I did my share of crazy crap. Like Guardian Angel protected me crap. We were at UVa's midsummer's & midwinter's 4 solid years and probably responsible for over-stimulating a few frats there every visit in the 90s (just giving perspective since a friend went there, not trying to compare to UVa [they were lightweights anyway]). So I'd like to think I'm no stranger to a good party in my day. I've never seen an entire community more hammered. We were handing out food and water to whoever asked out of desperate drunkenness - or even didn't ask but you could tell needed it. Did our best to pick up the entire lot before going to the game but wow - y'all are hardcore. Total respect.

I think it’s super black out drunk college students that are dropping their trash. I love walking over puke on the huckleberry after game days. 😑

I agree that people should clean up after themselves. That said, Blacksburg and Tech do an awesome job of cleaning up within a day or so. You don’t see any signs of trash anywhere. It is a well established process. I am always amazed.

What's worse, in a way, is seeing trash along the beautiful trails out on Brush Mt and elsewhere. I mean, you go out in nature to enjoy it and just toss your wrappers and cans off the side of the trails?

I live right off of the Huck and have cleaned it up day after for years. TBH its gotten so much better in recent years with the invention of BORGs

Well, that’s discouraging. Just sick.

Not simply discouraging. That is outright disgusting. There is no room in this world for that mindset. I'm sorry you were subjected to that.

How do these people even get into VT in the first place? Disgusting

This was posted by the vice president of Equity & Inclusion at VT. This was not my dorm. I am an incoming black freshman :(

This is disgusting but it doesn't represent all Hokies or the residents of Blacksburg. The sentiment I have experienced here is inclusion. WOC/Asian.

Any cameras nearby?

I was class of 2010. While I was there something similar happened to the BSA office IIRC.

what the hell? why are so many people mad about diversity and inclusion these days? how is that a bad thing?

wtf that's awful. in my 4 years I didn't run into anyone that would do something like this. sad. hope they catch the POS

This is in CID (it's got the custom whiteboards next to the door). It's a damn shame.

Is this a dorm? There's gotta be security cameras. I feel like they could identify and hopefully expel the POS that did this, right?

In a school of over 40,000 students you will find a bunch of good, bad and ugly. Clearly, you caught the attention of someone in the later categories. I'm sorry you had to go through this. I hope the perpetrator(s) learn that not all friends HAVE to look, sound and be like their dream selves. I just finished reading an excellent book entitled The Violin Conspiracy. While I had difficulty imagining the types of situations and relationships in the book, I have to say, Ray's grandmother was a wise woman. Stand tall, be proud and work to prove who you are!

Fucking racists. Pathetic monsters. I hope they get the person responsible.

Hopefully this is just another modern day [hoax by some self serving individual](https://www.thecollegefix.com/here-are-50-campus-hate-crime-hoaxes-the-college-fix-has-covered-since-2012/) that is certain evil exists everywhere but in them.

I'm sorry you had to see this and that it will affect the lens you approach VT with. Despite this, we're delighted to have you, and I hope you have a memorable and productive 4 years.

C/O 97 Grad here, white male. I never saw anything like that in my time there. That's disgusting. I believe most of us on the hall would have taken the offender behind a woodshed for a beating if we caught said person. The RAs wouldn't have written us up either. If the offender is caught, said bigot needs to be expelled. For the black people reading this, I hope nothing like this ever happens again. It's a reflection of the person that did it more than anything else.

Bet $1000 it was done by a DEI advocate for clicks/clout, it will come out in a week or two

This is probably a hoax. Just ask Wilfred Reilly.

That’s awful

Just from seeing this play out before...I betting it's a hoax

Dude def made this up, Jussie Smollett wanna be

Wow!!! I hope there is camera’s!! Don’t let that low life get to you- he’s obviously jealous and ignorant.

Hashtag Notonmycampus That’s horrible. The overwhelming VT crowd supports and loves you

To the OP: Inclusion will always win. I’m the meantime, learn to take contemporaneous notes. When did you see the racist message, who was around you, and did you tell anyone? Write every interaction down. Snap pictures with your phone of your notes with time stamps. Alert school administrators. Please let them know, you have contemporaneous notes, and will record their responses. Upshot: all of this is emotionally taxing. People kindly say, don’t let it get to you, but it can! It should. Why are minorities dealing with this stuff STILL? So, work towards documenting the issue and suing if necessary (that’s what the notes are for).

Don’t let them get to you. The world will hate you, gotta fight back. I’m sorry that happened, but we are here for you

Well this just made me heart drop. Do better, Hokies. Disgraceful doesn’t even begin to describe this bullshit. Unacceptable.

From NoVa, never met as many open racists in one place until I started my freshman year. Edit *at VT

10$says the person did it themselves for attention....

That kid is so fucking cool! He was a officer of DECA. Met him in Texas. Dude literally took off his tie and gave it to a kid who didn't have one so he could go on stage to claim his award. That guy is literally going to be the next President of the United States.

People who do stuff like this just reinforce the need to push forward to make our society more equitable for all.

Re-thinking my acceptance now, this sucks

Wow. That is fucking unbelievable

Do you have any idea who it could have been? That’s so horrible. So sorry that happened. I can’t believe ignorance like this still exists. I hope these kids get what they deserve.

I refuse to believe this until the perpetrator is caught. Too many hoaxes, and campus is way too open-minded a place.

Okay, Jussie Smollett. Sure thing

You think thats bad i worked there for a week and i saw not 1 not 2 but 4 fucking molestation cases pop up in my email because employees get police related emails for the school itself absolutely disgusting students there are a damn joke

People are tired of DEI, this is probably just backlash for that.

This was posted by the vice prez of Equity & Inclusion. I’m an incoming black freshman, that’s why I say “discouraging”; it’s definitely beyond disgusting as well. Jesus

I hate to say it but, some people are really good at making themselves look good on paper and then just being awful in real life. I've met so many in my three years here. And they last far longer here than you'd expect. They're like roaches.

People also have friends come through that didn't get in and party, then do stupid shit in the dorms. My freshman year someone had a friend stay over and when they got back from a frat party he drew some Nazi shit on the walls of the hallway. Everyone snitched on who they thought did it real quick.

VT is competitive to get into, but that just adds to the sense of privilege and ego these kids have about themselves. Moreover, for some reason VT is the school of choice for rural Virginia that fosters this kind of hate and discrimination all the while keeping up the appearance of being studious and hard working which people equate with good character.

Don’t rule out campus faculty, staff, and general people from the community. Despite being in a progressive college town bubble, you’re still in the middle of SWVA. There’s still plenty of ignorance and hate in those parts.

In the 3 years I spent at VT as an African American undergrad, I never experienced a single instance of racism. Don’t worry! 🙂

I was at VT for 7 years (two undergrad degrees and two masters) and I'm Black, and this is the first time I've ever heard of racism at VT. No hyperbole. You're fine as a minority at VT. I made plenty of friends, went on plenty of dates, and never encountered any racism. VT is a pretty progressive place.

As the parent of an incoming AA freshman, I can tell you that racism is everywhere. Do not let that discourage you! We’ve been coming to VT for the last 6 years and the majority of Hokies will make you feel like family. I’ve gotten lost more times than I care to share and had Hokies young and old ask ME if I need help! I’ve had strangers offer to pay for a meal. A random person pay for my gas. I have felt comfortable leaving my son on campus whether he was 12 or 16. For the most part, the Hokie spirit transcends the foolish. 💕

Don’t fight racism with racism. Whatever imbecile tagged this office just made it harder to fight DEI. Playing right into their hands.

I'm glad you haven't had those experiences but, your experiences aren't universal. I had a some white guy who lived in my building call one of my poc residents the n-word in front of me. I have seen slurs written on whiteboards all over my hall. I hope I don't come off as invalidating, and I'm SO glad you've felt safe here, but not everyone does.

Eh Glad you feel this way but YMMV is not enough of a disclaimer. Especially if you are some shade of brown lol

When did they replace the maroon chairs and remove the stage?

Mannnnn I remember when everybody was throwing up chem class in there after the D2 party my freshman year

Can someone explain this?

Been like this photo since at least 2017

There definitely was a stage before, you’re not crazy.

If you know you know

https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/i-shoulda-never-smoke-that-shit?_gl=1

I can confirm it was this way since at least 2016. I definitely failed a physics final sitting in that third row.

There was a stage back in the dark ages in the 90's while my bio and chem professors used overheads to pretty much confuse the hell out of us.

No I don’t know, can you please explain what it means?

Please explain

Yes. I, too, was a student in those dark ages.

It's a big lecture hall on the first floor of McBryde. It does not have air conditioning

pretty sure it does. I had classes in there in the august and september heat and do not remember it being no AC like my dorm

UPDATE: I have successfully eaten at Black Salt! A few days ago [I posted on this sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/VirginiaTech/comments/um49he/has_anyone_successfully_eaten_at_black_salt/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) about wanting to eat at Black Salt before I graduate as they’ve never been open each time I’ve tried to eat there in the past. Well, the owner reached out to me on here and hooked me and my dad up with a free meal today and it was absolutely delicious. He even included a to-go meal for my mother which was so generous. This was a high note to wrap up graduation weekend and a reminder of what I will miss the most about Blacksburg—its incredibly kind, amazing people. My dad said it was the best burger he’s ever had and I have to agree. Please support this amazing local restaurant with such a kind owner!!!

This is the way...I too will be supporting this local establishment until I no longer call this town home

Black salt is the best chicken sandwich in Virginia

I'm honestly kinda embarrassed how often I order food here, it's the bomb

Went there for the first time last week. Everything was delicious. Super cool inside. Extremely friendly staff. 10/10 would recommend

if anyones looking for a part time gig and are reliable i’d hit him up for a job

Pior to this post I've never heard of Black Salt (I'm a parent). When I pick up my daughter, I will definitely check it out. Congrats to OP!

i found this place when i was at vt 3 years ago and everyone i ever talked to had not heard about it. its criminal how underrated and unknown their food is.

Went there for the first time last week and have been 3 times since. I am so sad that I just graduated because I barely even got a chance to go to this place. The owner is extremely generous and even gave me a free drink when I had to wait like 10 minutes (that’s nothing!) The food is absolutely amazing! 10/10 food 10/10 service. Younger people please go because I can’t!

Welcome to the club!

Well now i have to go before I leave town. Been here 3 years and never went.

Wait, where? I go by Taco Bell all the time, but never noticed this place next to Italiano's!

Yousef is amazing!!!

Anybody else?

This but with I am a Junior COVID-19 I'm an Engineer AHHHHHHHHHHH

At least you got to have a fully normal freshman year and will again have a fully normal senior year. Honestly those are the best two years

At least your last 3 semesters weren’t ruined by Covid. Not being able to jump in Lane one last time as a student under the lights really hit hard

Yah, spun me upside down and sideways

Sometimes I'm lowkey glad I have to stay an extra semester to make up for it a little

Freshman to Junior year for me. Hopefully i finally get to go to a party this year lol.

Graduating early, so for me it's "freshman year, AHHH SENIOR." I'm going to have spent equal amounts of time online as in person in my time here at Tech. This upcoming year, I will be a senior who has never really had a Spring semester and has *no* idea how college really works because freshman year is really all a blur.....

I’ll never know what a full freshman year feels like

I transferred in from community college to tech as a junior during covid. Only senior year for me

Yea but I’m graduating a year early so covid was half my experience

Yes!! I’m at a family reunion and people keep asking “how does it feel to be a senior??” And just this is my reaction.

Me but high school

Bro same. Im transferring from the vccs system and i feel like the entire last semester is a blur. Edit: misunderstood your comment lol. I'm an entering junior

Most of my friends graduated I feel like I'm starting from scratch this year 😭

Freshman > sophomore > senior >>> junior, in my experience

Get yourself some student tickets in East as close to the student section as you can with us alumni in denial

Freshman year was ass because of covid

Also transferring from vccs. Glad this happened while I was here, not at VT yet. Would’ve been big mad.

Is junior that bad?? I barely made it out of sophomore and was looking forward to junior year

No don’t scare me

Hey /u/GenderNeutralBot I want to let you know that you are being very obnoxious and everyone is annoyed by your presence. ^(I am a bot. Downvotes won't remove this comment. If you want more information on gender-neutral language, just know that nobody associates the "corrected" language with sexism.) _^(People who get offended by the pettiest things will only alienate themselves.)_

Oh sick. Engineering?

Junior year is bad so that senior year can be good

Mine was ass. Probably major and life event dependent

Wait was this person telling them to use fresh person or smth? Lmao

Environmental science, hah. Couldn’t stand the idea of going to GMU.

Yeah it was a bot

Zesty. Haha yeah I'm going to tech pretty much because its a beloved engineering school. I live like 1.5 hours away near LU. (But fuck LU tbh)

I’m probably 45 mins from GMU (which has a better env sci program supposedly) but GMU is dead I hear. Very dull commuter school. No thanks. Time to escape the nova area.

Lol yeah, Lynchburg is weird in that there are tons of people my age, but no way to socialize unless I go to Liberty. Which I aint gonna do lmao. Although I probably wont make any friends no matter where I go 🤷‍♂️

Instead of working on my Senior Design Project, I made this

As a space fan, Hokie grad that was admittedly not an aerospace engineer, any chance you have a version without the title. You are probably familiar with it but there is a whole book on NASA font and logo design that makes a rad coffee table book[link to NASA Standards Manual](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=nasa+logos+design+book&t=brave&ia=web)

Yoooo, this is dope. I know what my new wallpaper is gonna be

Amazing! Do you have a high res version without the engineer title by any chance? Would love to wallpaper this!

As someone who did AOE then went to work for NASA after graduating, I approve.

That's awesome. Got a high res version?

Incredible use of procrastination 👏🏼

VT AOE TO THE MOON **🚀** **🚀** **🚀**

Eyy, I’m in AOE, looks great!

That's beautiful

Lol I pretty much exactly did this 2 years ago when I was working on my ae senior design.

This would look cool on a T-shirt!

This is way better

Love it, but wish it wasn't so blurry looking.

We sure do love nuke bunkers

How’s senior project going? Like in this age of Zoom.

Isn't this the project? Should get an A hopefully :D That's lit bro

Make one for every major! Starting with CPE hehehe

That would be excellent.

Lies, they'rere going to profit off your idea.

Goddard alum, checking in!

**way better, this is.** *-Boring_Neighborhood* *** ^(Commands: 'opt out', 'opt in', 'delete')

Saint! Thanks so much and great work!

You should make and sell stickers of this (idk how the trademark/ copyright nonsense works but I'd buy one)

Thirded. Also paging u/rtphokie

AYYY! I was at Goddard too!

Hokies can be proud of their history with NASA. One of the most important was Christopher Kraft who architected the way mission control rooms are run around the world. [http://www.collectspace.com/news/news-041511a.html](http://www.collectspace.com/news/news-041511a.html)

Hence the Kraft Rd in Blacksburg CRC!

Blacksburg ain’t playing!

This has been up for over a month now. I feel like those people would have already showed up.

When the town posted a pic on their Facebook page, people complained about the expense of making those masks and disrespecting the art. Ugh.

Lol they put hats and scarves on them during the winter. Don’t hear them complaining about that

I feel like art is supposed to be commentary on our world. Seems fitting imo

Good luck on exams everyone!

Thank you wizard cat

I hope yall kill it!! 💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽 My best wishes to everyone!

Or don’t. Then drop out and the join the military like me!!! ......please send help

Where was this wizard cat last Friday... :(

Thanks bud I need it

And so it is.

Don’t we all?

CS Department sings baka mitai

I have never loved a post and simultaneously wanted to delete it as much as this. Well done.

Someone please show this to McQuain

I'll show this to McQuain seeing as how I'm the one "singing' above him. Well done, but I'm not going back & giving you a grade bump for it.

Wow. Dwight is still there. I had him as a teacher 30+ years ago.

THIS. POST. IS. THE. GOAT.

This is the quality shit i subbed for

Thanks, I hate it.

Upvote if Dr. Barnette just showed you this in CS 1944

Well you made it! Mcquain mentioned it during a staff meeting and we had a good laugh lmaooo

deepfake used for good

This is the greatest thing I’ve seen on here

Thank you, I needed that laugh

That's rad!

Please let us know what he says!

I know right? He has his doctorate now. Same w/ McQuain.

I had Dwight for freshman 1114 and he was a little cocky because he had been teaching for 30+ years but I actually really liked him. Just felt a little sad when he’d try to relate to us and then realize he was too old to do that and got visibly sad.

Same. Barnette for 1706 in 89 and McQuain for something, I think discrete math, in 90.

lmao no way

If that's a recent picture of Barnette, he looks the same as he did when I was in his class 17 years ago.

It's not, that picture is from his website, and it's at least 10 years old

Congratulations to Moose

What a good boy. Proud of you Dr. Moose.

He's got a dogturate

Pretty sure a dog receiving a college degree was a whole plot point in a Community episode.

He technically didn't graduate due to overdue library fees (Community reference)

Is this the dog that was almost put down because Tech didn’t want to pay its medical fees? I know students actually had to start a GoFundMe to help the dog I’m thinking about

Beat me to it!

I GOT IN! I’ll see you guys in the fall :)

Please keep all other comments in this post or the Megathread.

Congrats to those who got in! For those that didn't. If you are still interested in going to Virginia tech for engineering, I recommend looking into their community college relationships. I went to Virginia Western community college in Roanoke. At the time I went if you got a 3.0 or higher in their general engineering associates program which is all the physics, statics, Dynamics calc 1,2,3, diffy Q, English, chem, and everything else in-between, Virginia tech will high five you through the front door and all 66 credit hours (grade of C or better) will transfer. I went into tech as a junior right into their civil/transportation program (I know it's different now). I also paid $5k total for that degree (also take into account living expenses or whatever applies to you). It's a great option for those that don't get in or those who want to save a CRAP ton of money. Either way best of luck to all!

i got in for psychology yayyy

Congratulations! What does the "interest in Aerospace Engineering" thing mean? That wasn't there when I applied to GE in 2017. &#x200B; Also going on the common application has really changed things, I guess. Before that we had like a 70% acceptance rate.

don't give up on yourself after one tough semester where your grades aren't what you're used to getting. I've seen so many freshmen come with aspirations to be engineers, only to switch to psych or sociology after one bad semester. Its not like high school. Physics classes suuuuuuuck. You might get some 25's on tests. Just don't don't give up.

Congrats, me too for Marketing!

Congrats bro. Just got into gen engineering. Maybe I’ll see you there!

Welcome to the best 4 (or more) years of your life

Congratulations! I’m currently a senior at VT in Aerospace, if you have any questions feel free to message me!

I am a CS sophomore student at VT... If you guys need any help dm me. Welcome to the family hokies!

15% acceptance rate?!

Care to share your stats? Just want to compare to some people who I know are waitlisted. I know there are tons of variables...

Congratulations! Welcome to the family.

Awesome man. Now comes the hard part.

You will see everyone IF VT opens. From Sands’ last speech, it doesn’t sound like it. Not trying to ruin your day, but also don’t think it’s fair that VT won’t announce a plan for reopening like so many other schools in the country.

Interested in Aero? You should check out DBF when you get to Tech 😉

Congrats, always a great feeling when you get that acceptance letter

Congratulations to everyone who got in! I already graduated from VT and it truly is an awesome school to attend, Good luck!

Hey dude, congrats on getting in! As a junior in Aero, I can tell you that while it is a challenging major, it's extremely rewarding. Classes in your future like Thermo and Aerodynamics & Compressibility (fluids part 2) can seem scary from a distance, but as long as you take it one semester at a time, you'll be ready to meet each new challenge as it presents itself to you. The material gets harder, but the problems get more interesting at a faster rate than they get more difficult. Oh and pro tip, if you want to do the astronomy minor, start it soon. Trying to pick it up after your sophomore year can be unwieldy. Best of luck!

YAY!!! I logged into my portal last night once I saw the email and since I didn't see a "YAY!" or "CONGRATULATIONS!" once signing-in, I thought I was rejected... I'm accepted for National Security and Foreign Affairs!!!

I got in for computer science and im so excited

Congrats so happy for you! I'm hoping same happens for me, I applied few weeks ago as a transfer will hear back in a few months so fingers crossed!

Congrats man! If you have any questions on Aero, please DM me

I got in for Computer Science!!! Let's go!!!!!!!

Congratulations! Happy to see another Aero Hokie on board

Congrats! I’m about to finish my Master’s in aero and I had a really good experience here overall. They’ve got a really good program here, so make the most of it! Best of luck!!

Bruh I got waitlisted. It doesn’t matter though - U of M all the way

Congratulations, I'm an incoming Grad student too

Make sure you bring a fan

Congrats! I got in for graphic design. I'm so excited. 😁

Congrats! You’re absolutely going to love VT

Got in for Computer Science oos in MD :)

Who else got in for Electrical Engineering?

I’m just glad every kid isn’t posting their admission on here.

Did you get any merit money?

I got in today as well but do not see any merit or fafsa information. Where did you see yours? Also congratulations. It’s my dream school but I can’t afford 50k I’m coming from NJ so out of state tuition

Wooo congrats! You excited?

same here !!! congrats

So I applied under general engineering and when you apply it asks if you have an idea of what field you want to go into, I don’t think it actually means anything as of right now. And huh I wonder why this year it seemed to be a bit more strict?

Not completely sure that this is what you meant, but 6,675 seats in the class doesn’t mean they only accepted 6,675 students from the roughly 40,000 applications. The class of 2023 stats on the acceptance letter were similar, and the acceptance rate was still around 70%, because they likely accepted more like 25-30,000 students in anticipation of only 6,675 committing (and for 2023 they were very wrong in that estimate lol)

Thanks for the heads up! Yeah I’ve definitely gotten a taste of physics classes, I’m in APC this year which is the calculus integrated physics, and yeah I’ve definitely learned I have to accept failure a lot. Thanks for the heads up!

Good stuff man! Apparently this year it was pretty competitive

Damn I got waitlisted on marketing. Cannot believe it was this competitive this year

Hey congrats man! I probably will, there’s only so many gen engineering majors and only so many classes! You plan on joining galileo?

Thanks! I’m super excited

Sweet, thanks!

Thanks man ! :,)

if you’re missing a right shoe it’s outside of norris, and if you’re still in the tree you’re good at hiding

Imagine missing a shoe...and not coming back to get it 🤦🏿‍♂️

I have those same shoes and just checked my feet to make sure i was still wearing both of them 🤦🏻‍♂️

These are the exact vans I'm wearing right now! Fortunately, I have both on haha!

Who throws a shoe?! Honestly!

Awesome character development

Preview Post: “I’m pregnant with my professors baby. Do I have to marry him (after his divorce) to get reduced tuition for myself and for my baby 18 years from now?”

They must take Ut Proism quite seriously

It wouldn't surprise me if this is just this guy's fetish that he's fantasizing about by writing stories about it on Reddit

Better than GoT season 8 tbh

Not to be that guy but it cannot be that hard to figure out who this is. :/

I'm looking forward to the AMA

Man I wasted my years at school. If I had known all that porn I watchef could have been useful...

It's probably all fake tbh.

What are you doing Dr. Professor Step Sister?!

Damn keep us updated

r/characterarcs

Sorry, faculty and staff at Virginia Tech do not get any reduction in tuition. So, it doesn't matter.

[I mean...](https://ibb.co/LnXVxDg)

I had nothing to do with it!

It seems oddly specific to LARP on a college subreddit.

I hope that's all it is.

[Actually, we do](https://www.hr.vt.edu/benefits/discounts/continuing-education/tuition-assistance.html)

Watching in the corner still counts...

I audibly laughed at this comment

All you gotta do is find out what professor is running the human sexuality pornagraphic video study and boom u got em.

Also we know it's a her from post number one " her house"

Employees do, but not spouses or children. OP was referencing spouse tuition.

Aw, who told!?

Shhhh. Just pretend I'm not here.

Eh these are pretty serious allegations so I'd refrain from calling out any specific professors out unless there's hard evidence

One of her students?

I didn't alleged anything lol, I said this could possibly be someone who ran the study.

Well the implication is that the person who ran the study is the same professor that had an affair with the student

Your making some pretty large assumptions, for all we know the student mearly has a crush. I don't think anyone has said anything about an affair.

Considering the second post says "things escalated during a project" I think there's an implication

Mack From Atomic Pizza/Qdoba Wasup everybody?! Its Mack! I've never used Reddit before but I just wanted to tell you all I appreciate all tha love everyone has shown me and keep planning to return tha favor! I hope everybody has a great spring break with moments to remember and cherish! Just sayin hi for now but you may see more of me on this Reddit thing. Peace, Love N Positivity! See you all when you get back! ✌🏽

Have a great spring break, Mack!

Mack you brighten everyone’s day man!

Arguably the best part of VT right here

Mack you da man!

Wait is this the guy that fist bumps you when you pay?

You should an AMA (ask me anything!)

Wait are you the dude who fistbumps everyone? I love ya man! Thanks for making everyone’s day better!

Can someone fill me in on this? Is he a popular student or employee at turner?

The reason I keep getting Qdoba. total G

You’re the best, hope the eye gets better!

You a fellow logic fan bro?

You make my day every time I go to qdoba, keep being awesome dude!

Dude u are easily the reason I go to dobes so much

Yo Mack you are a legend within the tech community! We seriously appreciate everything you do 👊

Man, I graduated last year and I’m so glad to see you’re still the man. Highkey you were the main reason I went to atomic so often, just to get that little boost in my day. Stay golden Mack.

Yo, what happened to you moving to North Carolina with your mom? I thought you were leaving town! I graduated but I definitely thought I saw you a couple times when I was driving around.

Thts one of my goals! Trying to figure out how to carry out bigger goals!

I really do appreciate that. Thats big!

Preciate tha love! 💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽

Just make a post saying AMA? I could definitely do that!

This would be great lol

Thank you bro, Im always here for anybody!

Im just one of the cashiers at Qdoba.

Thank You! 💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽

I've only heard his debut album. Great album but I have been sleepin tho.

Thank You! N you are appreciated as well! 👊🏽💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽

Thank you bro much appreciated! 💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽

It definitely happened. Stayed for a while. I've been back in VA since late September.

Goddamn I love him he's the coolest

Yeah, for reference check out /r/IAMA

Thank you bro! Much love! 💪🏽💪🏽

Ok. I'll get on it after work

Hokie pup enjoying the game!

Very sad to not be in Lane tonight, but enjoying the game with 81’, 84’, 18’, and ‘19 grads!

I’m a simple man: I see a cute doggo, I updoot

Mine looks just like that. Big dumb and happy with a hokie scarf

Awww, so cute!

I’m going to have to get used to VA TECH aren’t I?

Stolen from Twitter but had to share

low effort high impact

Love the seamless audio. flawless.

tomato sauce recipe: 4 cans of whole or diced tomatoes (28 oz each can) 1 can of tomato paste (about 6 oz) 12 garlic cloves Salt - maybe 1 tablespoon + 3/4 cup of olive oil - divided A bunch of Basil - if you like 1. Peel and mince garlic 2. Heat 1/2 cup of olive oil and put the garlic in the hot oil. Heat until golden and fragrant - very important - do not overcook and so it turns brown, it becomes very, very bitter. This is the most important step, **do not overcook garlic.** 3. Add can of tomato paste and canned tomatoes. Cook until reduced by 1/4 of volume and thickens. 4. Add salt to taste, remaining 1/4 cup olive oil and chopped basil. thanks for enshitifying reddit all while selling my info. https://github.com/j0be/PowerDeleteSuite

I'd walk both ways uphill in 2 feet of snow before I'd let VT Parking Services have another dime.

F for me too.😥

U h8 2 c it

Lmao nooooo

Wow so hip! Haha I also like memes because they are funny haha!!

Wait, you seriously lost your job offer? I guess I didn't fully realize that's what was happening to a lot of people right now

I too like to hit that yeet! Hahahahahahahaha!

That’s pretty sweet. Congrats

Yep. Mid-level position at double my major's starting salary with a team I've been part-time with for a few years. Dream position. It genuinely broke their hearts, but a hiring freeze is a hiring freeze. Pretty much SOL until the economy bounces. Looking into graduate programs in the meantime.

Will you still have the offer when it does bounce back?

I imagine so, if the industry recovers quickly. But even my one of my friends/colleagues said she'd suggest I also look elsewhere with how unsure things are. I'm anticipating on a very, very, big world crash once everything catches up to us and the bandaids on the economy wear off. There was a bubble already waiting to pop. Once earnings reports come out, we'll have a real look at what a world running at 50% can do. I'm not really expecting things to be normal for a few years.

I’m about to enter Virginia Tech as an accounting major. Think I should switch majors to a trade-related major after my first semester?

Me driving home on 81

Waze is a beautiful app. I've always wanted to get a programmer to scrape a months worth of data from their live map to find common locations hidden cops are reported. You'll have to be strategic about it because they restrict the load size, and probably divide the US into squares and hand pick the ones along 81.

And an extended slow period for Botetourt County.

Grad from the mid-90’s here. If coming from Roanoke, I’d take that exit at the sad gas station/truck stop not far past Salem - I think it was N Fork Rd (looking at a map today). I could wiggle those little backroads and cut off the corner and come out right south of Bburg. Having a fun car to drive made it fun too!

They’re making it not as severe now if you’re caught over 80 mph... still when I go over NC border it’s like open road it seems, my max is 85 and there will still be that Maryland car going 90+ passing

So awesome to see others used to take the Ironto cuttoff route. Will tell a story you will appreciate... One late Sunday afternoon I was flogging my ‘89 Civic Si back to campus after a heavy rain. I exited one of the tight turns and the road was covered in water...flash flood water. At least three car lengths wide. I had no idea how deep, but would not have been able to stop before hitting it. I dropped a gear and used the old motorcycle adage “when in doubt GAS IT!”. I felt the car drift a little while skimming across it, but made it OK. About crapped my pants after I stopped and looked back at what I had just done. Learned to be more careful after that, but also that the old adage worked. :-)

I-81 is a strange road north of exit 150. You can be in a clog of traffic and a mile later it is all gone, only to reappear a few miles down the road. it is also a frustrating road because of some of the drivers -- you can pass someone going 5 miles under the speed limit and not far down the road they will blow past you, only to be passed again going slow.

I swear Harrisonburg is just one giant trap for cops. Everyone I've known going down 81 to and from NOVA who's gotten tickets get them from that one 3 mile stretch.

I love Waze for the warning about cops, but that app delivers bad directions and delivers them poorly.

You can report cops on Google maps too. The UI is better and it will give you an option to use an alternate faster route if there is slowdown.

You can always tell who has never met a small town cop by how much they respect that drop.

yup, the Ironto exit. And drive past the suspiciously-good Italian restaurant in the middle of nowhere.

There's also 311 -> Blacksburg Rd, but it only shaved time off if you were going somewhere on the north side of town like Pheasant Run. I doubt it saves time anymore though - 81 is wider, 460 has a bypass that shaves off half a million stoplights, and both highways have higher speed limits than they did when I was there; the back road's probably the same as it ever was. Which basically means if you're driving anything sportier than a van you'll be in the car for 10 minutes longer and you'll actually enjoy yourself for the last hour or so of your drive.

Was it actually any quicker? I go back and forth from Roanoke a lot and the trucks on 81 make me hate roads

My Grandma lives on North Fork, so I have a lot of experience on those roads. It is indeed some of the most fun and scenic driving around.

Mt Taber road? It's the only place I caught air driving an SUV. Wicked fun when it's not raining or snowing out.

> Honking at people if they go 5 under usually wakes them up. I find they flip you off and try to brake check you :P

There is a bill that will raise the reckless driving threshold to 85 mph where the posted speed limit is 70 mph. Last year, a similar bill was held up in the courts of justice subcommittee in the house of delegates by the following members: * Todd Gilbert R - Counties of Page, Rockingham (part), Shenandoah, and Warren (part) * Robert Bell R - Counties of Albemarle (part), Fluvanna (part), Greene, and Rockingham * Christopher Collins R - Counties of Frederick (part) and Warren (part); City of Winchester * Margaret Ransone R - Counties of Caroline (part), King George, Lancaster, Northumberland, Richmond, and Westmoreland * Michael Mullin D - Counties of James City (part) and York (part); Cities of Newport News Hopefully people who live in those districts could contact their representative and get them to allow the bill to get the floor of the house of delegates.

Doesn't Google Maps have that feature now?

Ironto exit with manual transmission. Impossible to fall asleep when driving home after exams.

I always wondered about that restaurant, it’s in a such a strange location

That is it! Thanks for the memory jog!

Yes, because you used to have to take N Franklin most of the way from I-81 to Campus. There was a short bypass from the car dealerships on 460 near the I-81 exit to the Sheetz on N Franklin. otherwise you were on 460 Business for the whole way until South Main and then 460 became a highway. When traffic was heavy, the Ironto exit was sometimes faster.

I think they have something similar but honestly IDK.

Yes but it's not nearly as fast.

The bypass of Christiansburg wasn't open to traffic until around 2004 or so. They didn't increase the speed limit from 55 to 65 mph until sometime in 2007, so there used to be several speed traps on the bypass. Now that the speed limit is 65 mph and most people don't go more than 5 mph over the speed limit, the speed traps have all but disappeared.

My Aerial Photo that VT Posted on all Platforms Today!

Relay really took a toll on the Drillfield this year.

Campus looks so much smaller than it actually is

Crazy to look at this photo.... I can still trace the little cut- throughs I used to use as a freshman when I had to bike over to my geology lab at 8:00am on Thursday’s. I can barely identify the window I used to sit at in Newman as a sophomore thinking “wow these engineering classes got tougher”. I remember using the book store lot and a quarter off the floor of my mountaineer and then racing to grab chick fil a when I lived off campus and needed something quick. I could stare at this for hours. This photo threw me for a loop and makes me realize how awesome this school was for me and how many memories I have wrapped around those hokie stones. Thank you

Campus looks so grassy and green, and I love it. Glad parking and driving are difficult versus campus being one big parking lot.

This is awesome!

Spot the desire paths

This photo is awesome. I was just looking at it on IG trying to zoom in and see all the detail. Didn’t realize there was a bigger and much better quality version here!

Did you get permission to use a drone or you just did it? Edit: Not really sure why I’m getting downvoted for asking a legitimate question but ok. I guess that’s reddit for you.

It really shows how fucking odd of a building Pritchard is lol

Apparently all of you care more about some grass that will grow back than fighting cancer

I can see my (old) house from here!

Does that org pay to restore the grass?

I wondered if they'd put in a track on the drill field since I was there last. Glad it's not permanent.

Relay for HUMAN life but relay for grass death.

Looks like that every year though

It looks like you could walk from Pritchard to McBryde in 5 minutes lol

Thats awesome! I live in one of those new buildings that have sprouted up so

I was a freshman back in '92. Back then the campus had so much more green space and looked so much nicer. Sadly the VT we knew and loved back then is long gone.

That’s amazing, Im glad I could spark those memories inside you :)

Thanks! Probably one of my highlights of freshman year lol

That looks higher than a drone is legally allowed to go.

Actually I was in an airplane flying into Blacksburg Executive Airport!!

I have to doubt that VT would repost his picture if it was taken illegally

Pritchard, Lee, AJ, and Oshag always reminded me of public housing projects.

When I was part of the club that puts on the event for three years, we used corporate sponsor funds to cover a reseeding fee that VT charged us each year for the Drillfield. It’s always worse when it rains right before.

I'd hope so

Fair, but people could have been told to walk on Drillfield Dr instead or it could have been moved to another weekend where it wasn't pouring down rain

Not THAT bad

VT still has a lot more green space than other campuses, large quads and it is all still built around the massive drill field.

Also I’m p sure you arent allowed to fly a drone on campus. Thats what the drone cage is for.

How and why were you flying into Blacksburg airport?🤔🤔

Yeah I informed them it was from an airplane so it's all good and legal!

Isn't there a track somewhere on campus where they could do it instead of the drill field?

Usually it's worse

So much of the new architecture at VT is uninspired, not to mention the incredibly tacky faux Hokie stone paint jobs they have slapped on red brick buildings. They have really taken the whole Hokie stone thing to far IMO. Last time I drove through Blacksburg I almost didn't recognize the place it looks so different now than it did when I was there with the barns and silos on Southgate gone, the University Club house gone, the traffic circles, parking decks, new buildings, etc. While I greatly enjoyed the seven years I spent there, it is just not the same place anymore.

Please check direct message from me. Thanks!

Who makes that rule?

You can, you just have to have a 107 cert and file the paperwork first.

My dad flew me back for the weekend, We own a couple planes and a flight school so might as well take advantage of it!

Ah, well thats good. I always thought we were restricted to just a certain area. Kind of what deterred me from bringing a drone to fly.

I asked them about the training program just last week. They said check back later lol. Hopefully they get their stuff together as it's important for us at VTTI.

Good question, I remember when I was visiting tech a few years ago I asked about it. Dont know exactly what the deal is, and I never ended up flying anything anyway. But iirc there is a designated spot to fly stuff.

It's probably because of the airport. I suspect you wouldn't be allowed to fly drones *period* without the cage.

When I first became to Blacksburg the sign was big block letters and for months the k and r were out so everyone called them Ogers.

noooooooooooo

I wonder how much $ they would save corporate-wide if they just went to a “K”. And if I worked there, I’d love it when a customer complained about something and I could just point and say “k”.

Did someone actually get murdered there?

You ever get around to sending that youtube channel?

I made that reference a few weeks ago with a fellow Hokie, about how I went to an actual ghetto Kroger the night before, you know the ones with armed security hovering at the entrance and the solar powered blue light cameras down in RVA… they should take those to Blacksburg’s Ghetto Kroger to really bring the atmosphere to the right place… 🤣 My friend really enjoyed the reference; took us both back about 11-8 years.

Ucci has a window wall behind the sign.

Nice hahaha

Nah I’m just joking around. I got the term from a buddy who used to live in Nashville by a Kroger where I believe someone did get murdered in or around it.

And Star Trek style letters last I drove by there

This freak is stealing your panties and spying on you Close your blinds, put out cameras

What the fuck. I remember a couple years ago women were complaining about having underwear stolen. Edit: dammit! He just got permabanned/deleted his account, I was gonna search his account for details, now it's all gone. He had a comment saying he "knew the Panty burglar."

Great, now I'm paranoid people will see me out for a run and think I'm a pervert

Hasn’t this been an issue for a few years now? I feel like I hear about this annually

I lived in foxridge about 2 years ago and caught a guy going through my roommates laundry late at night one night, he bolted out the other side door before I realized what was going on. Really gross behavior, emailed Foxridge about it but they didn’t care enough to respond 😕

I'd bet money the "massive" one is Collegiate Suites. I lived next to it back in the 00s and it was nothing but chaos and traffic. Probably easy to hide a predator in it. I bet if someone puts cameras in their laundry rooms they catch this dude.

Yea, I remember hearing about this a few years ago when I was a student. Total creep

the first screenshot gets cut off where it gets interesting—he’s *wearing* the panties he steals??

Omg the panty snatcher????? Bruh I remember hearing about this, my apartment was freaked out about it, bc we lived nearby. Some sleepless nights tbh. I feel so bad for the women who live in that area.

I'd start by taking a good look at OP. Someone who gets a thrill out of stealing underwear and watching people through their windows would certainly get off by posting about it, letting people know its being done, and making it more challenging for himself. Same reason why so many criminals are caught returning to the scene of the crime. They get off on the chaos. But I could be wrong.

For those wondering, he has been stealing them from Foxridge [https://web.archive.org/web/20230520091418/https://www.reddit.com/user/albonterz1/comments/12zqk6f/foxridge\_special/](https://web.archive.org/web/20230520091418/https://www.reddit.com/user/albonterz1/comments/12zqk6f/foxridge_special/)

i might not even go to this school, but y’all came up on my recommended. this is actually fucking creepy and i hope he ends up getting caught before he does anything worse

I remember us making a potato gun and leaving the window open at our friends apartment waiting for him when the email went out from Vtpd

dear ladies, y’all would be SHOCKED if you truly knew how perverted men can be

There was an issue with a peeping tom in Blacksburg during COVID wasn’t there? There’s always one.

He goes as a runner/jogger and has 9 complexes with open/accessible laundry rooms within two miles of where he lives. The large one that’s “like a maze” may be collegiate suits (according to another commenter here). That’s what we get from this screenshot. Combed his account and found that he’s a white male, dark body hair, medium build; not skinny, but not fat either. Never showed his face. Dick was pretty small too, for what it’s worth. Likely late 30’s. Someone needs to send this to the police, he already knows we’re onto him now. I’m gonna keep an eye out on the subreddits he frequented. There was also a woman who showed her face in one of his posts. I wish I had screenshotted it, but I remember what she looked like. Edit: the woman is u/ toomanydawncollins (space so I don’t @ her), she actually sells content so I doubt she’s in on it. Dude probably just reposted a picture of her cuz he’s a simp.

You can find archived versions of all Reddit accounts even if deleted. Furthermore there’s a lot of legal action that can be taken against this guy, I would highly suggest someone reporting this to the Montgomery county sheriffs office. This is a sex crime

Lol yeah I remember this and then the crazy winter storm, and actually he came by my gf’s place at collegiate suites we saw footprints in the snow at their roommates window the next morning

[A few years ago](https://wjla.com/amp/news/local/virginia-man-gets-year-for-stalking-women-stealing-underwear-leaving-semen)

As long as you’re not in a laundry room or hanging out around one I doubt it

It’s prolly like the Hokie Bird. Every year there’s a new one.

I recently had a weird incident at Foxridge in the laundry room recently. Someone opened my clothes from the dryer and searched through it and left it open. Didn’t take anything (I’m a guy) but I thought it was weird because the laundry room was empty. Do you know how the guy looked like by any chance?

Collegiate suites has laundry rooms in their own units

Anyone feel like waiting around and attempting to catch ‘em? Five people have upvoted this but I’m serious

I’m surprised if there aren’t security cameras already? If not, it’s 2023. There should be.

Yall weren’t sleeping because he was stealing your underwear?

I don’t think it’s OP, the original (now deleted) account already posted about it plenty. They didn’t need another to do it.

Majoring in vaginatech

I clicked on the link but couldn’t see the post. Recently at Foxridge I noticed that someone opened my clothes from my dryer like 15 min after I put it in. Came back and my clothes were all wet and looked like someone went through them. I’m a guy and nothing was stolen but I was just confused why someone would open my dryer midrun in a completely empty laundry room at night and nothing was stolen

It’s in the image. You have to open the full image

This isn’t normal “perverted” behavior my man. I seriously hope you don’t justify this shit as passing for normal male fantasies.

I remember in 2018 or sometime around then a man was arrested for jerking off on the door handles of women that lived on Center Street and some other creepy activities:

Late 30s? Wouldn't that make him very conspicuous in an undergrad dominated college apartment laundry room? I assumed this dude was an undergrad or at least passes for a student. The rest of this is a simple geography problem if someone can find a list of complexes with open laundry rooms. Though reddit has a very poor track record with ~~detective work~~ vigilantism.

Good details!

Absolutely agreed. I don't live in bburg anymore, but that definitely needs to be done.

Its been a while and I didn’t get a good look at his face, but he definitely looked kinda sus like a black hoodie and all black clothes, feel like he had some kind of bag like a fanny pack across his chest. My roommate at the time and I are also guys :/

I got a van, you got zipties?

Yes? It'd be different if there was a thief going around stealing all types of clothes from both men and women, but when it's someone specifically stealing women's underwear it's obviously sexually motivated. A perv is entering their living space to commit a sexually motivated crime, and it's reasonable to be wary and anxious of him getting more bold and going on to actually assault someone.

It's pretty traumatizing having a perv like that in your apartment block.

People that engage in this kind of behavior usually escalate

Lol def not me. I'm a Marine who doesn't even live in Virginia. Just thought y'all would like to know.

we are both aware of the atrocities men are capable of. i never said it was “normal”. you threw that word in there. what it really is, is “absolutely disgusting”. i said men can be extremely perverted and do nasty things. he is one of those nasty people, but at least he isn’t hurting anyone (that we know of)

Collegiate Suites doesn’t have laundry rooms. We each have our own private washer/dryer. Maybe Foxridge?

Him saying he recently moved to a college town and has been stealing panties for years makes me think he isn’t a student. I may be wrong though. I wish I could remember more about his account but I do get the vibe he’s older than college age, but he very well may pass as a student. And yeah, I don’t wanna dip into vigilantism either

Yeah this doesn’t seem to be the first time either so it’s seems this person is in the area or spends a lot of the time going around different laundry rooms. Is he tall short? Color of hair? Facial hair/glasses? This person has opened my clothes from the dryer multiple times and left my clothes cold before I needed to go to work so I’m pissed af lol

Observe and report, vigilantism is illegal. No matter how much I may *want* to rough ‘em up.

Now you're starting to sound like the hokiepanties guy

Happy early birthday!

Nothing says "Break" quite like a single due date being bumped to Thursday

One and a half months, we can do this

The 6 assignments I have due tomorrow gave me plenty of time today to ponder about my wellness.

Thank you Tim Sands, you ended covid single handedly

My professor has two lecture videos up that we have to watch for Thursday’s class on top of attending live lecture while knowing we had spring break. I also had an assignment due today for another class. It’s a joke. Love the school and engineering program though.

It’s worse than not having a day off, it’s a total distraction. I can either feel guilty for working on what is supposed to be a fun break day (and not get anything done) or feel guilty for not working because there is so much to do. It’s a lose lose. I’d rather have zero break days.

As an alum I am appalled at this decision, a single day does nothing, especially if the faculty continue to force work on days off.

This schools' faculty and administration can bite me at this point. None of them seem to care about setting reasonable boundaries and expectations with their students.

ikr, I have an assignment due at noon tomorrow. The people in my group chat hosted a zoom meeting to go over it as if it was a regular day.

This made me laugh very loudly out loud

Singlehandedly changed my life!

Don’t think it’s a Tim Sands thing. Afaik UVA is doing the same thing and VCU is doing some weird “minimester” deal.

Going through this rn. I didn’t do much work today and had a really relaxing day, BUT at the same time I’m now feeling behind and almost overwhelmed

I PASSED MY DEFENSE!!! WOOOOOOOOOO

Congratulations Dr.

Idk what that is but congrats!!!

way to go fam!!

Haha it's an MS degree but I appreciate it anyways!!

At the end of your graduate program, you must go in front of a panel/committee of faculty and defend your research and knowledge of the subject. Faculty can (and will) ask just about anything they want and then after you’re sent out of the room, will determine if you deserve the degree. It’s like a Jedi Council grilling you for a couple hours except whether you’re allowed to join the ranks is voted on only *after* you’ve done the years of training and work.

Hahaha, this is the best one yet!

r/beatmetoit

Lol I'm not a woman nor a doctor. Just finished my masters is all!

My celebration is eating ice cream in my room 😎

Bless and thanks for the reward. But you should probably spend your money on something else not me haha

Reddit and vidja games bby. Despite all my accomplishments, I still feel like a kid lol

So we address you as Master then?!? 🥴😂😂

You have achieved the rank of Master and you may now have a seat on the council.

Oh sorry master please don’t punish me.

Mmmmmmm. Yes Master.

good thing he didn't get Anakin'd

I wonder if it’s common to fail. I rarely hear stories of not passing. What happens then?

Masters students must defend their thesis. PhD students must defend their dissertation. Thesis defense proves you’re an expert in what the panel thinks you should be an expert in. Dissertation defense proves you’ve contributed an entirely new and worthy concept.

Thank you! And yes, to clarify it was for the MS degree!

*You are on the council, but we do not grant you the rank of master.*

I have a friend, surname Bates. No joke, got a masters. Then a PhD. I call them Master Bates, PhD.

My advisor told me they typically don't allow people to defend their thesis or dissertation unless they are fairly sure they will pass. I also haven't heard of anyone failing myself.

Yup that's exactly right, and this was a MS thesis! Appreciate all the congratulations!

I can confirm that they are both generally nerve-wracking experiences that are much better in hindsight.

Yea, I’m glad you passed but it begs the question, what’s the point of stressing If it’s almost a given one will pass either way? Sure it’s nerve racking to be on the spot, have sound knowledge and presentation but the worry of failing imo would be a lot worse and compounding. Back then people probably did fail defenses on the spot but idk. I called it quits after a bachelors degree but I may go back to grad school someday. Just not as much needed in the technology field. I would think if one did fail they’d get another shot. I think PhD is more rigorous

Coming from someone who has no credentials The massive amount of time and work still culminates to a single pass or fail moment, so regardless of the high success rate, it's gotta be super intimidating. Plus the human psyche is always trying to convince people that they could be part of the slim percentage that gets rejected. Fear of rejection can be crippling for stakes way lower that your recent life's work.

Ah ok, I’m just not that familiar. I’d think a defense is like the final test and is rigorous, you pass or fail. Kinda like the navy seals hell week or something. From what I understand it’s like you’re most likely to pass unless something bad happens and it’s just a formality.

Right it has to be otherwise one can BS their way through it. There needs to be a way to weed that out

I feel like that sorts itself out. You can't get to that point without putting in the work

Orange cup gang

The emporium is a nightmare for people who are bad at math. It’s bad enough that your bad at math, but teaching yourself instead of having someone who knows the material just makes things worse.

I mean, the math empo was there wayyy before Sands was appointed. It's not really his fault he inherited a university with an unpopular method of teaching math

TBF the empo was before Sands.

I really didn't mind the empo too much personally, but I definitely understand why a lot of people did. It was off campus, so you needed to take a bus, it didn't give any actual instruction, and if we're paying for a good education, you would think we would get actual professors to teach the classes. Part of the future is sadly going to be self-taught on computers.

>coMe oN itS NOt tHaT bAd, YOu guYS aRe jUsT wHinY FrEshMAn -- the idiots leaving 5 star reviews

Just saying, khan academy is a free program and it has so many more useful features for LEARNING. like when you get a practice problem wrong, wouldn't it be helpful to see exactly HOW to apply the lessons to that specific question?? Can't believe i'm paying tuition for this...

I used to tutor there from like 2011 to 2013. They used to pay minimum wage to math tutors back in the day lol.

Imagine paying tuition to attend college, just to end up teaching yourself.

I know this is an old discussion, but I feel like I should weigh in from what I heard from another math professor. I should also mention that I didn't have to take any classes at the empo. What the professor explained to me is that it's not feasible for the university to hire professors for the literally *thousands* of students that have to take 1000-level math courses each semester. Hell, it already seems pretty crammed as it is fitting everyone who needs diff eq, multi, linear algebra, etc. As far as I can see, there's no real easy solution. Even taking into account GTAs teaching courses, there's simply too much required man-hours to teach everyone. At some point, there gets to be so many people in class that it's almost the same as it is at the empo now, with almost no feedbackk.

You can be good at math and hate it too!

He's been around for 5 years, though. If he had any interest in bettering VT's method of teaching math, he could and surely would have done *something* by now.

The empo has been there for over two decades. I think it was Torgerson's idea.

Most of the people leaving 5 star reviews work there, most of the people leaving 1 star reviews aren't freshman. People who are leaving 5 stars are just out of touch with how bad it really is

Just because it’s not feasible doesn’t mean the math empo doesn’t suck

You’re describing CS majors. Edit: well, some CS majors.

Sands probably thinks it is great. Since VT opened the empo a bunch of other universities have adopted the emporium model for teaching math. [https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/at-virginia-tech-computers-help-solve-a-math-class-problem/2012/04/22/gIQAmAOmaT\_story.html?noredirect=on](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/at-virginia-tech-computers-help-solve-a-math-class-problem/2012/04/22/gIQAmAOmaT_story.html?noredirect=on)

Doesn't fit with the bottom line

minimum 1 star rating, after 5 years it's 5 stars, makes sense.

Im a bio major but love math, just not the BS that was the empo

I was a math major, so I never had to take anything at the empo. Was that really the only choice for those courses? I can definitely see that teaching yourself a subject you dislike can be frustrating, but I also know that my peers were mentors there and would happily explain any topics. While it was online, there were at least math majors available to help with the learning

For bio majors math 1025 and 1026, your required math courses were only at empo. It was yucky

1205, 1206, and 1224 had components that required us to go to the Empo. I heard they did away with that after I left, but can't confirm.

Yeah that sucks. I suspect it’s an issue with the size of the math department. They don’t have enough professors to offer every major required course in both the fall and spring, so I suppose they fill those needs over 1000 courses. I think it would benefit the courses to at least have video lectures available, if they don’t already.

It's the same for any architecture students. Math 1535 and 1536 are required and only offered at the empo

Fire Pry and Whit Babcock into the sun Absolutely disgusting second half performance. Pry has once again proven he has no reason to be coaching a P4 football team. Whit needs to go as well two back to back awful hires.

That second half was maybe the most pathetic shit I've ever seen watching this team and that's saying a ton. I've tried to see the vision with Pry but I can't do it after today. And Whit cannot be allowed to hire his replacement

It's just so sad when you know exactly how the season is going to go after 2 games. Sigh...

Whit will just keep extending it, because firing Pry will mean the end of his own career.

It’s not even that I’m mad anymore, it’s just a disappointed tedium. We’ve been watching the same low-quality football that could barely pass muster in a Group of 5 conference for years now. I did not watch the game at all tonight after what happened last week. I saw the same “lUnChPaiL” defense that has been more like a brown bag come the second half paired with an offense more flaccid than Larry King after eating prunes, resulting in a snooze fest that devolves into medical malpractice. I do not even know where we go from here.

21 yards and a fumble in the 2nd half, fire everybody

I’ve become so apathetic (I’m pissed) to this team - actually, no, this “program”. Whit Babcock and the several coaching staff he has trotted out onto the field have continuously worsened the VT football brand. They’ve turned it into a “fools gold” of sorts, where we tout our great traditions and act like this powerful program, when in reality this is not a well-run program. I think we all need to accept that Tech will never take that proverbial “next step” until the university cleans house of the football/athletic department. Yeah we lost to a probably better team, but this loss felt different. We had a lead against a good team, at home, with all the momentum. But everyone and their mother watching the game *knew* that the Hokies will not make adjustments after halftime. They will let whatever happens happen. Simply put, this team does not care, and that comes all the way from the top. I’m sure the players do care, but they have never, since the days of Beamer, been put in the best positions to succeed and that includes things like mentality and toughness, not solely talent. I’m not an athlete, coach, or whatever but I have watched lots of college football (I’m an expert /s) through the years, having been a fan of many other college programs mostly due to family ties. What I do know is that VT does NOT have a good football product. Plus, given the damage to the brand sustained over last decade, it may be several years until we are again. I love Tech, it’s an awesome school and I made my best memories there. Ultimately, football doesn’t matter, but it’s a damn shame that we have to be publicly humiliated like this every Saturday in the fall these past few years. So, to conclude: if the VT football program doesn’t care enough, then why the hell should I? TL;DR: I love Tech, but we SUCK and I’m angy bout it >:(

The disheartening thing is how Vandies' coaches went back at the half and disrupted our entire coaching plan. This might be the worst-coached game I have seen in years. It is tough to be a Tech fan, and every year my hope dies lately. Coach Pry needs to be fired immediately. When we hired him, I was reading an article that stated he had a defensive mindset and would easily provide some similarity to Bud; this has not been the case. Our defense is notorious for giving up big plays, and tonight I saw 7, the most I have ever seen in a single game. Sad....

I don’t think Pry has ever coached a game against a power 4 team where he actually controls the game down the stretch. We always look fine early and then end up playing reactive football after halftime. Every. Damn. Game. Quite literally he is worse than every power 4 coach he goes up against except maybe Tony Elliott.

I'm 31 years old. My dad is a VT grad. I am not, but I was raised a VT fan since I was a baby. This is BAD. This is REALLY REALLY BAD. Getting blown out by 34 points in the 2nd half is flat out embarrassing. Heads need to roll, and they need to start with Whit and Pry's. The fans, donors, students, etc. deserve so much better. In 10 years Whit has managed to kill off what was one of the ACC powerhouses and a team that had STRONG fan support.

Game 1: VT was down 2 against USC going into the 4th and lost by 13. Game 2: VT was down 3 going into the 4th and lost by 22. Virginia Tech has either been out-conditioned or out coached to an extreme level in the 4th quarter.

I'm sick of this shit. Hokie football is a joke.

Can’t wait to see the fucking lames defend this L. Had people saying it was ridiculous to call for Pry’s head last week because we “really held in there for 3 quarters against SCAR.” Shit is pathetic

This collapse is so bad that Pry absolutely HAS to be fired immediately for it. But the VT way will be to give him 2 more years and just completely waste more time.

Drones is not a college QB. The fact that Pry and Co were unable to see that after last year and leading into this season is enough indictment to clean house. Whit cannot be allowed to be involved in the hiring process. All must go and take the suck for a few years

I’m a 44 year old Blacksburg native. I’ve been going to games at Lane literally my entire life. This is the lowest point in my lifelong fandom. For a large chunk of my life VT football was one of the most important things in my life as ridiculous as that sounds. I can’t even bring myself to care anymore. When Vandy scored the go ahead TD early in the third I turned the game off and didn’t even check the score again until the final alert came across my phone. This program is dead to me.

> He's not being canned during the season unless a complete meltdown occurs. Even then it's not a sure thing. Also, no one expected the Hokies to be competitive against USC - it was a competitive game until the very end. A loss at home to Vandy would be damaging for sure. So. Still that?

All that money alumni donated for triumph nil and we get this shit show for our first home game

We don’t do that at tech. We actually have just offered them an extension again Signed, the hokie boosters

I hope. Whit gets fired first so his dumb ass doesn’t try to hire another coordinator with no head experience

Bench drones, fire whit and pry and this season is already over. We will be lucky to finish 6-6. New staff for spring ball, I’m already done w this team. Just beat uva ffs

Get them outta here. Whit tanked our basketball program too. SMFH

I hate to say this as a Hokie, but for real change to occur you need to just stop going to games. Which is awful for new students

We don’t have talented players. They’re small, slow and outmanned. I don’t know what it takes to attract talent in the NIL era (besides money) but we don’t have it

They keep asking me to donate. I keep saying no until they start winning fb games. With an S

I had been defending Whit for a while, but I’m solidly on the “fire them both” train.

Defense 490 yards allowed. Worst since oct 2022

In Pry’s defense, he is only making 4 million a year. That’s only 77K a week, the average yearly salary in Virginia. Poor thing, he might be hungry when he is working.

It’s the moonshine mafia. The good old boys network isn’t interested in winning. We will never be able to compete in the current CFB climate. Just have to hope the inevitable implosion happens sooner than later

Yes, please. This experiment has run its course.

The worst thing Whit has done to the program has made the fan base apathetic to these losses. It's no longer about the excitement of potentially winning these games. It's the mental prep we as a fan base and as alumni go through in anticipation of a loss. As a season ticket holder, they locked me in this year with my donation. So the best I can do is sell my tickets (which I have) or just not travel to drive down revenue at the stadium. They upsold us on the experience in the club house with over processed food and free non alcoholic beverages, but I'd gladly give all that up to put a winning team on the field. Feels like I'd be better off setting money on fire at this point. And for someone who made VT football a cornerstone of my life (traveling during the fall for games, centering other activities around a football schedule), I'm now finding myself looking for anything else to do other than watch the game. For my own mental health, because watching the same thing over and over again expecting a different result is pure insanity. Babcock and Pry need to go, and Sands and the BoV need to make an AD hire reflective of the changing landscape in college sports, as well as hire a transformative coach. Not so much an Xs and Os guys, but someone that can shift the program into the modern era. Shane Beamer may not be an Xs and Os guy, but he's created the culture and the fan base is drinking the kool-aid. I'm not saying Shane is the answer (and I doubt he'll come because he's getting paid SEC money and wants his own legacy), but that is what we need to make our program feel like we have a pulse again. Signed, A frustrated and defeated Hokie '99

We are a poverty program

I knew Pry wasn't head coaching material when he had one of his first interviews. After Beamer got forced to retire. His son or Bud Foster should have been Head coach. Virginia Tech is stuck on mediocrity. They are happy to just go to a bowl game. As I see it VT fans are cool with mediocrity because they show up to games in Blacksburg,and they travel well to away games

There's a point in the fourth quarter where the game is still in reach and there was a four man rush that looked like a twelve man blitz, and Drones was sacked for ten yards. The point it was over. Part of the problem is the NIL and transfer portal. How do you get players to be invested in a program and its fan base when they know, if make enough snaps and plays to make a decent game tape , Win or lose, they can transfer to the next stop the following year, getting paid all the while. Players have all the leverage. It's why you've seen alot of great coaches retire.

As a thirty year Hokie I remember the great times.. those were long ago. I still wear my gear with pride but it's been a hard to swallow decade or so. Fire Pry and put someone in who understands that it's a sixty minute game.

Anyone else worry this program just won’t have the ingredients for relevance without just getting unbelievably lucky on some unnoticed recruits or transfer portal guys? Feels dreadful.

Unless Tech is willing to invest $$ into the program this is the future. The players need better coaching and conditioning. The O-line folded numerous times. Drones was blind-sided numerous times. Tech is lucky Drones was not seriously injured. The D-line was manhandled and Vandy rushers could not be stopped. Absolutely horrible home opener.

Once people realize that’s it’s impossible to get back to our glory days, you’ll come to terms with this is the best it’s going to be. CFB as a whole sucks now. Good kids only want to go to the same 10 schools that will throw millions at them. We are not one of them. I really would like to know how you think we can improve.

Gotta call SpaceX up. “Can we launch a rocket with only two astronauts on board, no return trip?”

I don’t totally hate everything Whit did, bball and baseball under his tenure have achieved a lot in school history. HOWEVER, football is king and absolutely no AD can hire a third football coached after the first two got fired. Let’s move on!

Did they play sandman?

Nothing will change until Sands is gone. He hates VT.

The consistent inability of being able to play a full 60 is maddening. We almost lost to BC last year because we just abandoned the field in the 3rd quarter. If it wasn’t for Bhayshul Tuten absolutely putting the team on his back we would’ve been screwed. I think the TD vandy got after the half was bc our CB got absolutely cooked, but even then there was no safety help. 3rd down defense play calling was also criminal. Babs also needs to lowkey be arrested bc he extended Fuente in like 20-21 when we could’ve hired Shane. I’m also getting tired of this program just tarnishing the Beamer legacy every gameday. I’ve watched this team since Tyrod and Logan Thomas man, and it’s my dream come true that I get to be here. It just feels like I’ve got here when the party is long over.

Haha and it has only gotten worse! Down 28-0 at halftime to ODU. Whit has got to go. He has destroyed our revenue generating sports. It’s so bad.

Babcock and Pry gotta go…NOW!

Whit Babcock is the biggest idiot in the ACC! He is as bad as Fuente! They both killed VT football. In today’s times no player wants to play for VT! We had the 757 and the 336 until those two had shower time!

My name is Whit Babcock and I’m terrible at my job. Give me someone to fire so I can hide my ineffectiveness!!!

I’ll give you millions before I can even see if you can recruit. I’m just that dumb and did I mention I will give you millions in a going away present. Who wants to coach a dumpster fire!!!

0-3 VT's worst start since 1987! Babcock is a cancer on VT Football. If Pry goes, Babcock needs to go and let the rebuilding begin. Otherwise Pry will simply get replaced by another poor Babcock hire.

VT WON AT C'VILLE AS THE CLEAR UNDERDOG AND STILL OWNS UVA VT STILL OWNS UVA IN FOOTBALL. 21 of the last 23, 17 of the last 18. EVEN MICHIGAN HAS DONE BETTER AGAINST OHIO STATE. VT GOES BOWLING. GO HOKIES!!!!!!!!

JC PRICE LEGEND. UVA SAVIOR BRONCO 1-5 VS VT. STORMING THE FIELD ON THE ROAD INCREDIBLE SCENES Both 6-6 and they call it owning the state while we fire our coach lol

Hokies not only beat the Hoos but also beat our brain dead OC Cornelson. GO HOKIES!

I believe Fuente would have lost that game. His teams found a way to lose when they were winning half the game.

I thought that their UVA For all Virginia commercials were kinda funny, showing all kinds of agriculture scenes. The only time anyone from UVA came even remotely close to a farm is when one of their alumni was foreclosing on it.

I think Price deserves an interview for the permanent job after saving the season like that. He's a Beamer Boy and a Hokie through and through who knows what Virginia Tech football is about. Fuente wasn't, and that's part of why I think he never really gelled with the program. It was just a job for JF. There's no doubt in my mind he would have bolted as soon as a better offer came along. Imagine what Price could do with an OC that's actually worth a damn. &#x200B; Go Hokies!

I didn't know travelling fans could storm the field. That was so awesome. Also loved the response by our interim coach at the end. Dude was emotional.

Armstrong does not have the makings of a top collegiate athlete

I mean uva was a 7 point underdog

So is Tech going to the next rounds or is it done? I don’t really understand how football brackets work haha

That "*for all Virginia*" sticker on their helmets is arrogant af. Bitch you don't speak for us, or Norfolk or Harrisonburg or Williamsburg or Lynchburg (ugh). VT has more fans across the state, more fans in NoVA, more fans in Hampton Roads, comparable fans in Richmond. Should have been "*For cookie dough eating, ascot wearing weenie Virginia*.

My first time storming a field. Vibes were immaculate. 😮‍💨 #LANE STADIUM NORTH, MOTHERFUCKERS Edit: That’s MY stogie smoking head coach

UVA has always been the school of the landed gentry in Virginia. Plenty of UVA alumni are "gentleman farmers" who own farms but they usually hire VT CALS grads to do the actual farming while they are off banking, doctoring or lawyering. LOL

Yes, that's all

I'm for it, clearly the team is behind him....did you see what the American football coach did went he went and coached a pro soccer team in England? heart really is a huge factor.

Cheap 4 year contract as head coach, what do we have to lose at this point

It’s not allowed technically, but nobody can stop a crowd of our size and it makes more sense to let it happen than try to prevent it from a safety perspective

I met the guy on the field and spoke to him for 30 seconds and didn’t even know it was him until I saw pics of him on Twitter today. Was great

Respectfully disagree, he injured his ankle and still threw for 400+ yards.

I think as far as stats go, he was literally THE top collegiate QB. It was either him or the fella from Pitt. Will he make it in the NFL? Maybe. he might have to rely on being Ed Sheeran's stunt double as a backup career.

Thanks for the analysis Junior Soprano

Tell me your bookie who gave you UVA +7

Dude...you've been reading those odds upside down for how long!?

We get to play for a bowl game, which will be announced in a few weeks

They really fucked up an opportunity “For Ole Virginia” which would have been dope and fitting and way cooler than our “GRIT” one

Fuente would have found a way to give up a pick 6 on a kneeldown.

Yeah me and my dad saw people on the other end of the stadium just walking down the steps onto the field so we walked on too, I stopped and glanced at the security guys and they were just standing to the side letting everyone walk on

I think it's pretty embarrassing for the home team though. But an awesome for sure for traveling fans. I am trying to imagine if ND fans tried to rush our field last game. That would have been crazy.

He hurt his ankle and then didnt do anything. The biggest game of his career he let a rolled ankle own him. Toughness is a 2/10.

1 person got it! Lol

Never rule out the underdog.

ESPN: wait who played Florida State tonight?

5 turnovers later......

Pregame: Losing this game really hurts a team's chances of getting to the ACC championship. 4th Qtr: Losing this game doesn't reallly hurt FSU's chances of getting to the ACC championship. OMG.

ESPN's commentary is the worst. Halfway through the fourth, they were talking up Florida State's defense, giving them credit for keeping the game as close as it was. Umm, way? Their rush defense was cheesecloth all night.

Best use of this meme.. ever

... that’s not even a point a quarter... (Napoleon dynamite voice)

It was hilarious upsetting how quickly Herbdouche & Fowler backpedaled after the defense made FSU their bitch. Coming into the second half they were both saying that the D ONLY lost a couple of people and still had a lot of talent left over from last year whereas during pregame they kept going on about how the D had been gutted by losses.

Let’s not forget that they were showing the FSU runner down at the 2 for the next two quarters like it was some kind of conspiracy, and when they reviewed our rush *at the goal line* on fourth down to be sure, Herbstreit had the audacity to say “Oh I guess some goal line plays get to be reviewed and others don’t.”

This aged well

retroactive r/agedlikemilk

The pre-game show was pathetic. I thought FSU was playing FSU.

Good thing the ACC Championship is chosen by a set of record based rules instead of a shadow committee using the eye test from behind closed does so ESPN can make an hour long show about it

Herbstreit has always had it out for VT. If he says something good about us it's almost always followed up with a negative. They were waxing on about how the D had been gutted by the draft and that the D was going to be the weak spot for the team and then second half they were trying to make it sound like the D didn't lose anybody.

I was at the game so I didn’t hear, but our offense left points on the field. The FSU defense deserve some credit. But our defense needs to be talked about for about 3 quarters of game time.

Herbstreit’s a fucking asshat. But we all knew that.

Well FSU shouldn't have played hurry up. I think they were afraid it could have been a fumble if reviewed

This is what I was telling my fiancé. They spent about 10 seconds talking about us, and those 10 seconds were spent second guessing our team. I hate it but I love it at the same time!

You say that, but the committee has done an incredible job so far. Haven’t disagreed with a single CFP selection so far. Conversely, you can argue that rigid rules kept Alabama out of the SEC Championship game last year despite being the best team in the country. In really small sample sizes especially with unbalanced schedules, like a 12 game season or 8 game conference schedule, I think subjective opinion means more than objective results.

Was ranked correctly. They had no place in a 4 team playoff. Im all for expanding to 16 so teams like UCF can have a shot... but there’s no coherent argument to put them in a 4 team playoff just because they went undefeated in a shit conference

I just disagree. But that’s why there needs to be more than 4 teams like you said. So these sorts of arguments don’t need to happen.

I just disagree. But that’s why there needs to be more than 4 teams like you said. So these sorts of arguments don’t need to happen.

The only argument for UCF is if you think there’s something sacred about having 0 losses, ignoring all context of how they got to that record and what we know about every other team. I guess I just don’t buy that. Being undefeated is cool, but it’s not a trump card for me. Glad the committee felt the same way. The only thing impressive about UCF is that they didn’t happen to lose a game. But they’re schedule was a complete joke — week after week against teams that have never seen a 5 star recruit. At least in Alabama’s “weak” schedule they played against 5 star recruits and NFL talent every single game. Every team UCF played was full of rejects who weren’t recruited by major schools and will never see the NFL.

These arguments will always happen. The NFL playoffs leave teams out all the time and they’re record based. No matter how big the bracket there’s always going to be a team left out.

My thoughts on the matter:

The first thing I thought when I looked at it was that he was bowing to the Hokie Bird.

That UVA logo screams "nothing personnel kid."

To me it says “I so desperately want to be badass. I mean look at the swords. Look at the fedora, milady. If you don’t think I’m the coolest, darkest, edgiest ever then I challenge you to watch the video I just made in my basement doing this exact pose in full Cavalier cosplay. Yeah... didn’t think so.”

Honestly who are we to judge

Keep in mind that their changes apply to ALL of their athletic wear ... while our new “logo” is only for the academic side

True, but at least we won't have the swoosh on our uniforms

Our new logo is bad, but UVA pretty much hit us with the "hold my Zima."

Virginia Tech rolling out a new logo. What do you think?

I like it better than the real one.

Please Jesus let this all be a joke.

I'm using this as my desktop background.

I really liked this, so I made a wallpaper version with the "Invent the Future" tagline: https://i.redd.it/3nr7dtx52vf01.png The default image size is kinda tiny so I used the CRT effects to hide the pixels

Quality shitpost.

I'll take this embroidered on the back of a puffy jacket please!

Please tell me you have a higher resolution of this for my overcompensating monitor.

Quite grand!

[Yup.](http://i0.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/facebook/000/018/929/graphic_design_is_my_passion.jpg)

Better than the logo they revealed earlier today.

Are those palm trees, or palmetto trees? Either is an excellent choice.

Paging presidents Crockett and Tubbs!

I like that they're converging the look between the logo on academic stuff and the logo on athletic stuff, but I kinda think they could have just used the existing athletic logo everywhere and called it a day.

This is amazing, someone get this on a shirt

My God, it's glorrendous.

Alraight boooohhhhhyyy

There are so many reasons I miss Blacksburg and this is one of them.

I’m telling you son! This is it!

I've lived all over Virginia and in Texas, I've traveled all over the Eastern and Midwest, and when I moved here, I decided I was here to stay.

I went back to visit this past weekend and instantly felt at home.

Spotted flying over Charlottesville today…

That's fucking amazing

No amount of rubbing it in their face will ever be too much.

Holy shit, this detail makes it SO much more amazing (chef’s kiss). 🤣💀

I like to think that’s part of the reason

I love the CS department :)

Of 'corse' he will.

I swear CS 2505/2506/3214 was so annoying because of this. Assignments and due dates don't sync with canvas and the site looks like it was made in 1998

God Bless McQuain. Good to see some things never change. He acts like such a dick during lecture but is easily one of the most approachable professors outside of class. He was always helpful during office hours.

time to take a humanities class

He was a really good teacher when I had him...

It's frustrating that the due dates don't always sync and stuff but having access to the notes and stuff not tied to canvas I always found to be super helpful.

McQuain for life. Also, Systems does a similar system, though now because of covid it's now all on discord.

I never had McQuain as a professor, but he subbed one of my CS classes for a day. He spent at least 15 minutes talking about how self-driving cars will never be a thing because a car can't tell the difference between a little girl and a dog running into the street. Not only was this incredibly off-topic, but it aged horribly. This was only 3 years ago too.

Glad to see he’s still there. Had a few good courses with him 10 years ago.

McQuain was one of my favorite professors at VT. I remember on the first day of Computer Systems he walked in the classroom and said "Welcome to Hell"

And write the textbooks and make them required for the class

Anyone want to link a website?

only got one class of my four on canvas

> the site looks like it was made in 1998 I know right. It doesn't even need JS to render the page and doesn't result in the browser process allocating gigabytes of memory like a lot of websites from 2018 and onward do.

The entire Computer Science department and all of its programs are dogshit dinosaur technology. The course structure is outdated as well. Taking CS at this school completely killed my love for it, glad I transferred to a different field.

😂 did he mean that if it was a dog it’s not as important to stop lol? Either case if there’s an object in the road the car should stop. I think it’s still a little while longer until self driving cars is the norm. It’ll probably be something like autopilot where you would still have to be sober and awake just in case.

Self driving cars are still forever away. Don't know if you were trying to be serious with your commment or not.

https://courses.cs.vt.edu/cs3114/Spring21/ 3114 offering for this semester

Wait. Are you saying it's a dream come true?

> The entire Computer Science department and all of its programs are dogshit dinosaur technology. What technology are they covering that you consider obsolete and what technology should they be covering, but don't?

Made me realize I didn't want to do CS, I wanted software engineering. Go figure, puting software in the engineering department did not in fact result in a software engineering program.

His point was if the car doesn't have enough time to stop and has to choose between the dog and the child, it won't know to hit the dog. He must have not known about image recognition technology and even if the model/tech couldn't spit out a split-second decision now, it's silly to say it will never be able to in the future.

I am 100% serious. I don’t own a Tesla or anything so I’m unfamiliar with the extent of their capabilities but even my Honda drives itself (on the highway). Maybe the tech isn’t there right now but it’s silly for big M to say we’ll never get there because of one tough scenario.

I feel like I just jumped back a decade

That background texture is very 1990s. [https://web.archive.org/web/20210117105621/https://www.spacejam.com/](https://web.archive.org/web/20210117105621/https://www.spacejam.com/)

You misunderstand. I'm talking about WebCAT and the other various course sites. The course work that is outdated is the heavy bend towards making Computer Science a double major, or supplementary to other engineering majors. There's a heavy focus on Computer Engineering knowledge that is nearly useless to someone who wants to work purely within the realm of computer software development. It's evident in the relatively low credit count for an engineering major, as well as the heavy overlap between ECE and CS required courses. Most other schools offer CS outside of their engineering program for individuals looking for an education that is heavy in software development. I remember reading an article a few years ago about how students struggling in CS benefited more from technical writing tutoring than from mathematics tutoring, yet Virginia Tech still excessively emphasizes advanced mathematics that aren't necessary whatsoever for Computer Science (namely, the later Calculus classes). There's a lot about the curriculum that could and should be changed. Before the pandemic, there were *rumors* that CS was leaving the engineering college, which is a great first step, but IDK what those plans look like now.

Gotcha, well hopefully that’s a very rare scenario. A lot of times people have very little control over their cars if it’s at high speed regardless. Either scenario could dodge into the direction you swerve. ABS brakes are still the best bet.

I'm curious on where in the track line you switched fields. While I understand and see your view on a lot of the points you make, I'm not too sure if I necessarily agree. That being said, I'm am ignorant towards what other schools offer, but I can share a bit of my perspective. Advanced mathematics wasn't something I was necessarily the best at, but I can appreciate why we learn it. It's honestly probably done because VT wants their Engineering school to look prestigious, and every engineer has to take these classes. Yes, that sucks. Every school does it. Not that it's an excuse, but schools do want their degrees to hold value, and it's a benefit to us all in the end. It's a class you take as a Freshman to build skills in learning, studying, dilligence, etc. to use later on. I'm fine with it. Speaking on the systems part of CS we learn at Tech, I think the ECE department is more than what we just learn in 2505/2506/3214. ECE goes a LOT into the physics of it, while in CS, you don't deal with that. For me personally, I really enjoyed the Systems part of CS, and it's something I would have never been introduced to if it wasn't required. Is it something everyone will end up working in or enjoying? No. Not at all. But understanding how your computer works is something I feel an important part of CS, and it's not just worthless. There may be a couple of topics that you may never use again, but the class as a whole is ultimately a good learning experience. Lastly, I'll share a bit of my perspective on software dev jobs. To me, the biggest thing you learn from a VTCS degree is being able to learn a new code base and how to add on to it, or how to start a project from scratch only using the tools you know. While there's more too it, this is fundamentally what you have to do as every employer has their own code base, things they use, limitations, etc. Expanding your views on what's out there and what to keep in mind is apart of having a CS degree to me, and I do feel like just wanting to go straight into software dev isn't the right mindset, and there's already ways to do that without a degree.

I never used WebCAT that much when I was an undergrad in CS (close to 20 years ago now), but I never really had many problems with the Curator. But what's the specific issue about the course sites? The only thing I've seen mentioned are inconsistent due dates listed for course assignments, which is a problem that could easily be fixed.

> I had to fight to get OS course to use something other than CVS, in ~2015. When I took the equivalent in 2004, we didn't even use source control. Was it Dr. Back who was insisting on CVS? I remember him using it for a number of projects he was working on back in 2006 through 2009 which made some sense given the time frame. But most places that were using source control were using SVN by then. I didn't start using git until around 2010. I'm surprised that he hadn't transitioned to using that in 2015 though for a course. I could understand if he continued using it for source control for existing projects he maintained if the git cvsimport tool wasn't able to handle the repositories he uses for source control. But if you really want an example of old technology, when I took the compiler course in 2007, we had to use a virtual machine program called hypomac. When running the program, it would display a message with the year it was last updated (which, IIRC, was 1981). That professor, now retired, also insisted on us printing out the source code for assignments and turning them in in addition to uploading them to his ftp server. I managed to convince him to accept a pdf of the source code instead though :). But I think these instances come down to specific professors rather than the department as a whole. They certainly could do a better job in ensuring that various technologies are used (for instance, comparing a client-server VCS versus a distributed VCS) rather than sticking to technology that's out of date for certain courses. A big example of this is the primary language used to teach lower level courses. When I was there, it was C++, but they were transitioning to Java. I could still see evidence that they had finished transitioning off of Pascal when I first started though (in 2002).

Not that it's an excuse, but schools do want their degrees to hold value, and it's a benefit to us all in the end. I think this is an *incredibly* toxic viewpoint to have. Why should we force people to suffer just so that they get some useless "prestige" for having gone through a difficult program? There's zero net benefit to society. In fact, there's zero net benefit to you as an individual as well. [Research](https://www.npr.org/2020/06/20/880379282/the-mind-of-the-village-understanding-our-implicit-biases) shows that [the school you get your degree at doesn't matter](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/051915/university-prestige-really-important.asp) when it comes to earnings in either the short term (immediately after college) and long term (many years after completing your education). While having rigorous coursework [is statistically correlated with improved learning retention](https://www.edweek.org/leadership/studies-find-desirable-difficulties-help-students-learn/2011/04), that difficulty must serve a *purpose*. Having to grapple with a terrible, 40-year-old grading system, sitting in line for literally five hours waiting for a TA, etc is not purposeful. It doesn't teach you anything other than "getting a CS degree sucks". > I'm curious on where in the track line you switched fields. I switched into Political Science this semester, which is my second semester of Junior year. I held out all the way to 2506 and 3114 and at that point I started to completely flounder. Part of it was the pandemic making getting feedback on coding projects next to impossible. Part of it was a complete lack of interest in the course work on my part, mainly because most of everything in 2505 and 2506 (other than learning C) felt like a waste of time (I have no need nor desire to learn about how to build a circuit, and if the claim is that it teaches logical operators, Linear Algebra already does that and in a less convoluted and directly applicable way). I just felt like the curriculum was throwing shit at the wall and hoping it stuck. I didn't feel like I'd be able to more effectively apply my programming knowledge to new scenarios. In fact, I'd go so far as to say that my programming skills barely changed from high school to my second year of college. I didn't learn anything other than how to program in new languages, and how to use JUnit testing in Java. I didn't feel like I learned any useful problem solving or code development strategies. I didn't feel like I learned how to better think about edge cases, especially because in order to accommodate WebCAT's auto-grader, some edge cases were automatically excluded as possible inputs and others weren't, and this distinction was largely arbitrary. I won't put the blame solely on the course structure and content. The CS administration is also incompetent and lazy (the school had to *threaten* the *head* of the CS Department to update the server software for rLogin because it was decades out of date and possibly a FERPA violation). But it's a large combination of factors that make CS generally unpleasant to take at VT unless you're double majoring or minoring for engineering applications.

Exactly. The fact that, despite being one of the "best" schools for Computer Science in the state, we don't have practically *any* distinct **in-major** tracks in a field as diverse as CS is just a travesty.

WebCAT is a terrible grading system. It can't handle the load from the much, much larger CS population, its appearance is horribly outdated and difficult to navigate, and during a crucial time where meeting with a CS tutor, TA, or professor is harder than ever, they removed some of the site's feedback functionality, meaning you know next to nothing about why your code failed. Grading criteria is obscenely strict, to the point that TAs last semester were having to essentially tell people what edge cases they were missing or what was wrong with their code because too many people needed too much assistance. It also crashes frequently, or flags things incorrectly.

I think an Engineering degree *can* hold some benefit, but I don't think the trade off is worth it. I think having the option to take it in either is the best choice (this is what many institutions do) but since Virginia Tech's CS Department doesn't seem to want to diversify major tracks (CMDA and all these new CS-adjacent degrees don't even fall under the CS degree program) the best way to make a best-size-fits-all degree program for Computer Science is to house it in the liberal arts and sciences college.

Not only that, but with the suggestions made in the comment you're responding to, the bachelor's degree in CS would in no way prepare you to for a post graduate degree program in CS.

You might <think> that but not really no. In the work force a HUGE majority of programmers have no idea how their computers work or how most of the technologies that power a computer work. The majority just want cpus and ram to compile and want cpu's and ram for their apps to run on. Even with all the AWS and Azure and the rest of the virtual solutions out there, very few programmers, even newly graduated ones have an inkling of how they work, function or are delivered. There is NOTHING wrong with that. There are specialists that deal with that aspect. Having a broad based understand of computers and how they operate and how virtualization and bare metal systems work is a great add to your resume and may likely lead you towards a wider variety of job opportunities but not having that understanding won't hinder or limit them either. To further add, this is why the BIT program at VT is so successful. It is a blend that promotes a wider base of understanding of IT. If any CS major becomes frustrated they should seriously look to move to BIT as it provides a base in the business - accounting and the like as well as technology and programming. Edit for grammar and missing words...

Research shows that the school you get your degree at doesn't matter when it comes to earnings in either the short term (immediately after college) and long term (many years after completing your education). Appreciate your response. I didn't make this clear, but I do agree with your sentiment. Just moreso reasoned out why it exists. It's more of a "shit sucks but oh well" for me. Not like I could / it could likely change. Other than that, I agree with a lot of your experiences in CS. COVID didn't help either, and I can imagine taking those classes to be way harder if I did it during COVID. Learning more than Java is a big critique I have for the program as well, and it isn't til maybe your CS electives and Comparative Languages I feel you actually do something outside of that entire ecosystem. I have taken alot of CS electives though here at Tech, and I can say I've enjoyed them a lot. I'm glad to hear your enjoying your new major though, and I appreciate hearing your perspective. Best of luck!

Tooling changes over time, but having the abillty to learn how to learn new tools is what the degree program gives you. When I went through the degree program, git wasn't really used in industry yet. Now it's dominant. But because I had learned about graph theory, data structures, and file systems, I didn't have trouble understanding the documentation for git or how it works at a low level. Others are stuck having to copy and paste commands from stackoverflow because they don't have that background. That said, designing systems at a higher level (how do you integrate technologies like presentation, storage and networking) could be something that the CS program could do better, because that's something that industry needs, but new graduates don't have a good idea how to go about that without gaining experience in industry over time.

> Now I just wish there were better ways to get VCS into the hands of more "authors" (researcher, writers, hobbyist, chefs, etc) so they can have better tooling for sharing and collaborating A lot of these VCSs were designed for software development in mind. Most people who aren't into that are more interested in a system that keeps back ups with notes and can be accessed by multiple people to make changes. Something with the capabilities of git is overkill and they could use something like Google drive or etherpad instead. > And the department heads should have enough of a cohesive long term vision to help ensure that the curriculum flows. At least that's my opinion. When I was there, Dr. Kafura was the department head. Then he stepped down and they were searching for a new department head when Dr. Ryder took the position. I haven't kept up after that, but my guess is that they didn't try to enforce a coherent policy beyond the language used in the undergraduate cirriculum. But given what you're saying, they haven't really made much of an improvement since I graduated. > So yeah idk, mixed feelings about the CS program that's for sure lol. Free riding project partners is a well known issue in many settings unfortunately. I've had my fair share of experience with that in quite a fuew pairings and groups over the years.

> Appreciate your response. I didn't make this clear, but I do agree with your sentiment. Just moreso reasoned out why it exists. It's more of a "shit sucks but oh well" for me. Not like I could / it could likely change. Ah you did, I'm just burnt out from trying to distinguish syllabi from each other when every class has "Theory of Politics/Political Theory/etc" or some variation thereof in the title -_- I do wish I got some web development experience in CS before I left, as that's useful regardless of what field you're going into (especially HTML and CSS), but those aren't included in any of the core curricula for CS.

Web development, for a while was affected by the framework of the day issue. When I was there, they had a course called introduction to the internet that did teach you how to use HTML, CSS, and javascript to host simple webpages (though I took it before JS frameworks were a thing, even jquery). IIRC, the course also covered XHTML, XPath, and XSLT. Knowing basics like that would be useful, but having a course that specifically teaches frameworks like React or Vue would not be, because things change over time and while what's used in 2020 could be taught. By the time you're in industry 3 to 5 years later and work for a number of years, those frameworks may no longer be relevant and a completely different framework is considered industry standard. That said, even if you learn about technologies that are outdated, the degree program does prepare you to know how to learn a new language, framework, or whatever and not get stuck on what was in fashion at the time you were going through the program.

> Not the VT degree program where using anything but the pre-approved assignment tools is the standard. I also went through the VT CS program and now use a VCS, config management tool, container management tool, and languages that I didn't know when I graduated. What the CS program taught me was the importance of reading documentation and how to understand it. I now have to work with people who have no idea what the man command is for on any Linux or Debian distro. > There was and still is no encouragement of any VCS from the early classes. > > It's a critical tool, regardless of which one you choose that shouldn't be shoehorned into a 3rd year class, was my point. It's a very good point and I agree with you. When I went through the program, source control wasn't really given much thought because it wasn't thought of as a critical component 20 years ago. But there's no excuse not to treat is as one today. Assignments should be pushed to a git server and not only graded on whether the assignment works, but also the quality of the version control history (meaning one's grade would be reduced if they had commits like "now it works" and "fixed bug"). When I went through the lower courses, they evaluated programs by the quality of their inline documentatoin. If you were missing function documentation blocks, you would lose points. > But having taught classes to co-workers on both git and mercurial, I needed none of that to teach how to use the tool effectively. Because they were not going out and designing a new git workflows or git based tooling. They needed to just work on code, together. I'm not sure of the background of the co-workers you taught, but why would they need classes to learn how to use a VCS rather than just read through a getting started tutorial (create repository, commit code, push to remote, fetch from remote, etc)? In general, people need to learn how to take time to read through documentation. Otherwise, you never gain more than a superficial understanding of what you're working with. If it's something you use on a daily basis, then having that deep understanding proves to be very valuable. >> Others are stuck having to copy and paste commands from stackoverflow because they don't have that background. > That's a black and white fallacy. There is a huge swath between those extremes. That has been my experience. It really comes down to people who don't want to bother reading documentation and just want to copy and paste commands somewhere to get their changes into source control. Then when it comes time to review, I see several merge commits and 10 other commits to make 3 lines of changes. I had no idea what git was when I graduated. When we started using it at my workplace, it took me a couple of days to get up to speed. I also spent several weeks reading documentation and resources to become the subject matter expert. > think if VT better understood the utility of having a SE/SA track within the CS department then we would be cooking with gas. I'm not saying there isn't room for improvement in the program. At least when I went through it, I felt I was well prepared, and with years of industry experience, I never really had problems figuring things out over time. That said, you have more recent experience with the program compared to me (now being out of it for more than a decade), so some of the deficiences are more evident now than they were when I went through it.

All is well in the world again

Still, Fire Fluente

And suddenly, 2020 is no more

Give em the spanking 👋🤚

I prayed more for a win here than to pass my finals.

still fuente has to go

Doesn’t ignore the fact that major changes need to happen, still a losing season but finishing with a W is always nice.

but yes at least the cup is back in its rightful place

Kinky ETA: nvrmind did realize that was a kid in the pic oops

I’m not saying that there’s *causation*, but I am saying that UVA beat us last year and then someone decided to eat a bat. Could be a coincidence, but I think we were naive to chalk the 2019 loss up to “just a game” and not accept it for the terrible omen it clearly was. Also, we won this year and the vaccine got approved. Again, not saying there’s *causation* but maybe saying that someone put a curse on the cup and hell rains down on the earth whenever it’s not in Blacksburg. [because this is the Internet, I will clarify that all the above is said tongue in cheek]

Agreed. In a perfect world this woulda been his last season, however considering his outrageous buyout and Whit caving to “2020 excuses” he will be back a year IMO.... sadly!

Yes my brotha 🦃🙏🏼

Well obviously losing to them last year started the problems this year. So things are looking up lol

Fire Fuente and his boys and hire more legacy players is the “fix” in my mind. Imagine having Kam as a DB coach lol. Daryll Tapp has done great in his role!

Yep, looking forward to another 6-6 year

Even if Fuente gets a new OC, it would be great and more hopeful, but he won’t do anything. Should have happened last year.

Me waiting for my teachers to input my grades so I can graduate

Bonus points for when your professor is a cunt and accuses most of the class (of seniors) for cheating on an assignment two days before graduation. Yeet.

tbt when my buddy went to graduation and on his walk he got a letter saying he wasn't finished. Turns out his teammates all gave him a 0/5 on the design project final peer review which was like a third of the class grade. He spent the next month sorting it out and missed his trip to his home country. He claimed he got no feedback from his partners.

Me willing COVID-19 to die: COME ON SARS!

Anybody have a problem where research just suddenly is missing from your dars report?

Anyone else's dars say they need like 300 more credits to graduate? (CS major if that matters)

On the flip as someone who never cheated in college with an engineering degree it was very frustrating being surrounded by people cheating flippantly all the time. Tough luck to any cheaters (and I'm sure there are some), I worked too damn hard to have my curve shafted by folks who went out three+ times a week. Edit: woops made all the cheaters map

Oh wow, that sounds like a bad glitch

That's rough, buddy

Good thing you don't need the curve since u study so much!

Congrats on the 4.0.... must be flippin' amazing to be that smart!

> I worked too damn hard to have my curve shafted by folks who went out three+ times a week. >Edit: woops made all the cheaters map Since when is it a competition? You either learn the content or you don't. This isn't an ethical matter. You get a job based on what you know. The GPA just changes what doors are open to you. It's your fault for sacrificing a higher GPA for your *definition* of "integrity". You stunted yourself. Imagine if you had used your resources AND worked as hard as you did. You'd have had a perfect 4.0GPA and half the stress.

Or they’re just fuckin smarter than you

I assume it is. 3 of my other CS friends are having the same issue

I took between 19 and 21 credit hours and worked 25 hours a week. Always working and taking classes winter and summer too. Four years of borderline starvation and a motivation for a better life! In my hardest classes everybody used cheg. I’m not a student now but I could bet you a solid portion of the student population in a completely school from home environment will be cheating. Started with a 2.4 freshman year but built it up to a 3.2 Or so

It’s literally in the ethical code of the university and subject to the honor court? My major wasn’t very difficult just volume intensive.

Cheg is extremely common in engineering at least when I was in school.

It definitely is. Cs requires you to take 124 credits to graduate. 300 credits is impossible

No need to be defensive! I was complementing you! However, you highlight a good point. It is more effective to "work smarter, not harder."

Are you the kind of person who doesn't smoke pot or didn't drink before you were 21, simply because they're against the law? To each their own, but my worldview is that you can pick and choose what arbitrary rules you want to follow. If it doesn't hurt anyone or have ethical or moral implications, then it is fair game.

Cheats are fake and I laugh with glee at their expulsion.

No I’ve been doing drugs sense I was a kid. I partied in college but I spent more nights in McBride 100 doing assignments or studying for exams than I did having fun.

I wouldn't be so quick to hate. Would you agree that some tasks are repetitive or unnecessary if you already understand a topic? Additionally, it is common knowledge that grades (and GPA) do not correlate to understanding or knowledge (see curves). Therefor, it stands to reason that someone who desires knowledge would not want to waste time completing these meaningless assignments while still remaining competitive in the flawed gpa system.

It’s breaking the rule book (aka cheating) and punishable by extreme sanctions up to expulsion, it also breaks the curve. When I had a 3 week crash course in static’s with Hendricks with 2 Pearson homework’s a day each 2ish hours long you might imagine it s quite frustrating to stomach students joking casually while the professor is out of the room about using cheg.

Look im all for equality of opportunity, but it's your fault for not using resources available to you. Don't complain when you handicapped yourself... working with others and teaching yourself is fine as long as you understand the material. Maybe you need to re-evaluate what the goal you are working towards is?

I worked my ass off and it paid off it just sucks seeing all these cheaters not try at all and get cushy jobs paying twice the average graduation pay cause they got a frat hookup and cheated their way through college. I look down on those dogs. I couldn’t even afford cheg half the time cause I was too poor. Edit: it’s funny I just remembered a video I watched in marketing about how people always mentally justify cheating as just getting ahead like everybody else.

Math department be vibin

Bruh I had an A in multivariable calculus the whole semester up until I nearly failed the final. It’s like the common time is designed to make you fail, not test what you know.

*laughs in math empo*

The math empo is such a flawed way to teach. We pay thousands of dollars to attend one of the best schools in the country and you're forced to put solo cups on computers to get help

Granted this was over 15 years ago when I attended, but I still think about it some today. The math department hates you, and is awful at understanding the student's needs. They simply think you are a stupid piece of shit and they hate the thought that they should be there for you and not the other way around. It is a culture problem that from the sound of it has never been fixed.

Math empo is a disgrace. Almost every other school manages to actually teach classes, and decent calculus, matrix algebra instructors are relatively cheap.

Liking the carti leaks

They make the math classes way harder than they need to be. I don't know why they want students to fail...

One of my favourite characters

the multivar common time from last semester was painful

Taking MultiVar rn... keep me in prayers

The multivar common time always fucks, you just have to have a professor who doesn't care about it and grades based on his/her final instead.

I did the opposite, had a D up until the final, pulled of a 96 to get a C and not have to take it again. Professor was so bad at teaching, even with me sitting in the front every class, I only learned it when I pulled an all-nighter before the final and taught myself my own ways. So many times at tech I would wonder why i even payed for these math professors when I end up teaching myself...

Imagine getting A’s

Calling it “teaching” is generous.

Back in the olden days (2010) I was a math tutor there. Trust me when I say they spared no expense ($7.25/hr) when it came to the quality of the tutors.

VT BEAR 2020

My previous post still stands. Someone wrestle that damn bear by Sunday and you get a $200 DX shopping spree.

Back in my day, we had a horse on a treadmill

Somewhere in the distance is a jealous squirrel and duck couple

~~Hokies~~ Bears

Bear market confirmed

They’re really popular at the CRC. Trash cans are always flipped and people don’t really bat an eye at it anymore. Hopefully it’s not spreading to campus but I think that’s the only way Montgomery county will act up and do something about it

Wait there was a bear on campus?

Driving back on Sunday be like...

Pro tip: it adds some time and Google will never route you this way, BUT you'll stay moving and if it's really bad it can actually be a trip saver. If coming south you can take exit 141 and then turn left. Go to the round about and take the first exit onto Rt 311. Take a left onto Bradshaw. It's not far from the round about. That will turn into Rt 622. That takes you up and around on a 2 lane back road and eventually dumps out onto Rt 603. If you turn left here it takes you to exit 128 which is the exit it usually tries to get you off 81 and onto 460 to go up through Salem if going north. That will put you at the bottom of Christiansburg mountain and the 3 lane section of 81. It's basically taking you around on the north side of 81 instead of the south side where it's jammed packed with trucks and stop lights. Look on Maps and you'll see it make more sense. You can technically get all the way straight into downtown this route, but it may not be the best as far as time goes. https://imgur.com/a/NIexr6u

Blacksburg Rd always comes in clutch 💯

i saw this meme and now our eta is 20 mins shorter, thanks!

This happens every time students return from break. Every. Time.

Roanoke/Salem were hell earlier

Hey I’m from Salem and then lived in Roanoke for over a decade. I know it like the back of my hand 😂 But yeah, 81 has been really, really bad lately. I have to travel to Roanoke twice a month on Sundays and it’s gotten to the point I just take the backroads because there’s always something. There’s a neat little scenic drive down Ellett and then back into the country that then takes you to Catawba/back down to Salem. It takes about 10-ish more minutes than taking 81 on a non-backed up day and sometimes I prefer it.

I remember taking the express bus (NoVa/Vienna metro to campus) it was a good 4-5 hour ride like a jail bus or military recruits. Silent and ominous… once you get off the bus it’s back to torture/studies

*Me in Salem just hating the traffic and glad I don't have to go back until tomorrow*

i left the nashville area at 4:30 CST and got home at 1:30 EST. if you’re curious that’s 2 hours longer than it should’ve been

Expect the unexpected 😂

The people in charge of 81 in Salem should be publicly tried for being complete ass wipes.

God it was such a mess. That drive was miserable start to finish. It was 81 all the way from PA for me

Idk what it was called, but when we drove out of Blacksburg last week we took a 2-lane hilly backroad for about 30 minutes to end up right before Roanoke, and that was the most miserable I’ve ever been in a car lmao. I was staring daggers out of the front windshield and still getting motion sick. Felt like we were rally racing in Amish country.

I love Salem and Roanoke, no shit talking

^^^ I’m from Roanoke and this is how I go home on breaks because not as many people know about it

You can follow that back road all the way into downtown Blacksburg, but beware that during good weather, that road is full of bicyclists and there are a ton of blind hills/corners.

This is pretty much how I came in, even if it was a little longer staying moving makes it 100x better. Plus very pretty

It's pretty, too. My favorite way to go from here to ROA.

Shh don't tell them about it

This is why you should get to know people instead of assuming things about them from your windshield.

Northern urbanite try not to call a rural area with more than 1 tree a KKK stronghold challenge (impossible)

Whitehall NY is more Klan territory than Roanoke/Salem

Be being from that area 😐

>people in charge of 81 in Salem Who do you think is "in charge" of the interstate? What do you want them to do to make your life better? VDOT is spending lots of money to widen the highway to three lanes while maintaining traffic. It really wasn't possible to take down all the Jersey barriers or do anything else in the construction zone. Perhaps if "people in charge" of driving their own vehicles paid attention to driving and everyone else on the road instead of driving like they are the only one that matters, there wouldn't be as many wrecks.

Oh, it's definitely not the poor weather conditions route.

Oh, it's a lovely drive during daylight hours. It's a great stretch of road if you enjoy more enthusiastic driving also.

Just go to google maps to figure it out. No one that’s not real familiar with the area could do it without a map.

https://imgur.com/a/NIexr6u Probably because I got the adhd brain too. Here. Drew around the route numbers. The road doesn't do that.

Exactly my question…

Bc they/them is an ignorant sluss who equates rural with Klan. Would prob need an inhaler and therapy if they saw someone open carry.

Also one of the most segregated cities in the southern US. Edit: Okay y’all can downvote me if you want but try googling it first. Maybe “in the southern US” is a bit of hyperbole, but it is certainly up there in Virginia. Roanoke is historically, and continues to be, highly segregated by race and class. Though you could probably say that about many US cities.

Your reply is bullshit. When there are multiple crashes every day and people killed in accidents on a regular basis in one part of an interstate, it’s a problem with the road and the people n charge of it.

Yeah I was having a ton of fun with my stick shift car lol

What is the % of people that drive on that road and crash? (1) People unfamiliar with this area should not be driving the way they do on the stretch of i81. (2) That section has been getting slowly improved for over a decade - literally moving earth is not as easy as making a simple road. Here is the current expansion: https://www.virginiadot.org/projects/salem/interstate-81-widening-exit-137-to-141---roanoke-county-and-city-of-salem.asp - Almost $300 MILLION dollar project. There is usually a meeting every 1-2 years about expanding i81 but almost none of the VT population ever shows up to voice their opinion. Show up next time and maybe they’ll be more inclined to move these projects up in priority.

It’s amazing how people come on here and defend VDOT. Blows my mind. Are you one of the people working on this horrible administered project or what? It’s shouldn’t take 4 years and hundreds of accidents to expand one lane. It shouldn’t take 6 hours to take a 4 hour trip. It shouldn’t be dangerous other than normal dangers to drive to Blacksburg and back for a game.

> Are you one of the people working on this horrible administered project or what? Not everyone that disagrees with you works for the “other side”. > It’s shouldn’t take 4 years and hundreds of accidents to expand one lane. What are your qualifications on this? Did you show up to the VDOT public meeting and show us what it should actually cost and take. Obviously not. > It shouldn’t be dangerous other than normal dangers to drive to Blacksburg and back for a game. It isn’t. People are always driving too fast for i81’s conditions like it’s the same conditions as northern stretch, i495, or i77/74. Would you rather have the state increase patrols WAY up and ticket everyone for speeding and following too closely? That should help reduce accidents.

The highway was declared inadequate about 10 years ago. Several solutions were put forth to expand the number of lanes, including a plan that called for separate truck lanes. No one (politicians) wanted to pay for any of the work, so the plans were all shelved without any further development. Gov. Northam finally got things moving by pushing for an increase in the gas tax in counties that I-81 runs through to provide funds for additional lanes and other improvements. Some of the worst sections are getting attention now as money is available. Again, what do you think should be done right now to satisfy your rant? A lot of the problems come down to what ddshd said, "People unfamiliar with this area should not be driving the way they do" Actually, anyone driving on I-81 needs to drive with caution.

If I were Virginia Tech, I would simply set our testing to wumbo

I'm never giving a cent to VT when I'm out

I wumbo, you wumbo, he she me wumbo.

Is Tim Sands a "Dr" as in PhD?

My friend goes to Duke and I’m honestly sad to say that their covid response is another thing they’re beating us at.

I wonder if I see him on campus and be like “Hi Timmy” if it would A) piss him off, and B) get me in trouble

He needs to treat all the on-campus students to pizza and give some swag to these new students that feel like they are in prison and are getting "written up" for things like going to the bathroom down the hall or talking to a floormate in the hall or in their room.

I think the only donation I would consider would be towards the department that I am a graduate of.

I am out. And I’m not giving a cent either. Sands’ response to COVID is embarrassing. They should sack him.

Wumbo. Wumboing. Wumbology!?

PhD in Materials Science and Engineering from UC Berkeley.

Any yacht you can get while also buying a house isn't worth having. He's Tim Sands, not some measly VP.

Yes, you can choose where the funding is awarded!

This guy gets paid nearly half a million a year to disappoint me, week after week.

This dude gets more than most surgeons. Let that sink in. Dudes who spent 15 years in school, literally have lives in their hands every day, still paid less than some dude who could be replaced with the Ask Madden feature on Xbox.

god dammit, brad

Fire stinespring

I think that Whit should tell Fuente he has to replace Brad, if he refuses, then he can resign in protest and not get his buy out.

Quite a disappointment at Homecoming ! The great Cornholio needs to be flushed ! 💩

hes an absolutely terrible coach. he doesnt bring in good talent. he doesnt develop players. he doenst play to the teams strengths. oh yeah and his go to 3rd and short playcall is a fade.

He needs to go! He gets paid more than most of us will ever to do worse than a kid playing madden NFL

The OC, Fuente and AD all need to be run out of town for these piss poor games. #FireFuente

Half a million? What a ripoff, I could disappoint twice as many people for 1/4th the price.

If I had another shot at life, I'd honestly try to be a coach at a big school. No, seriously. That's the money right there 🥴. You make more than the US president, the school's president, the governor, lead heart surgeons... wild.

The fans are showing up and paying alot of money in the process - Whit has an obligation to HOKIE Nation to present a (much) better product than what Fuente and Corny are capable of. I think it would be counterproductive to release the coaching staff mid-season but if Fuente is coaching next spring it's on Whit at that point. GO HOKIES!

Watching our Hokie football team week in and week out is exhausting, frustrating and disappointing. We should be fielding a top 25 team every year and expect nothing less. Winning starts at the top and now is the time to find the leaders that will turn our program around. I feel bad for the student athletes who give it their all and leave it on the field every week. Let’s Go Hokies!

It's absurd without a doubt, but the only way to change it is to stop feeding the beast. And as much as people complain about VT football, they're still whipping out their credit cards without hesitation.

What a fuckin bum

Cornie is Fuente's Andy Richter; tho Fuente ain't no Conan neither... Both need to go at this point.

Welcome to Virginia Tech athletics.

Spend money on actual academics please. There are still buildings on campus without air conditioning.

my orgo class is tryna persuade dr.berg to replace him because historically, orgo professors make epic football coaches

To get rid of Cornelson, we have to get rid of Fuente. To get rid of Fuente, we have to get rid of Whit. They just extended Whit 5 more years. We're going to be bad for a long time.

Poor you. I don't get paid to hear all you whiners each week.

I tried swiping to see additional photos of coaching staff. I was disappointed again.

He gets paid 3.5 million a year and somehow he still sucks ass

Yep imagine 4 years of college, 4 years of medical school, x years of residency after which to start making the money and this dude makes more.

How does one become a college coach? Are they in demand? I need to become one sheesh! 4 million is not easy haha…

When folks in the stands can call what is about to happen, I know a visiting DC crew can too.

You should look at what Tim Sands, the top administrators and a bunch of professors at VT are getting paid. It is the same deal at other schools too. These academics and college coaches are the new robber barons. I think the highest paid employee of the Commonwealth of Virginia is the basketball coach at VCU. Edit: I was wrong the highest paid state employee is the FORMER president of ODU. https://www.bizjournals.com/washington/news/2021/09/06/virginia-state-salaries-2021.html

a loooooot of people get paid more than surgeons

my high school ran a more complex offense

Dammit Janet!

I remember those years 😂 last I heard he ended up at JMU somewhere

I agree but this should have been done after 2019… a good program would do that at least.

Ryan Willis

I think you mean 3rd and jet sweep?

I’ll defend the AD because he did give us our basketball coach and the AD when I was a student was much worse. At least we can look forward to basketball. When I was there it was football or zip. Occasionally we had an interesting basketball season.

AD? No. Most of our sports are doing fine outside of Football

Who should we replace Fuente with?

I'll write down the plays on slips of paper and pull them out of a hat for $50K/year That'll probably get better results, too. How would any opposing defense be able to prepare for a kindof-randomly generated gameplan?

And if you get canned you get a big buyout and then next year some other dumb school hires you and you start all over again.

Well… to be realistic it’s probably just as hard for a high school coach to make it to division 1 (let alone the NFL) as it is for a player. Small junior kid leagues it’s usually volunteer they don’t get paid 😂. Usually ex players become coaches but not always. Still boggles my mind though maybe some like Fuente accidentally enter the league… you’d think a strong high school coach gets hired for a college gig, then a better college team gig, then nfl or a stronger team etc. all we have on Fuente is a good record at Memphis

I'd just be born to rich parents. Much less work.

Can anyone print flyers and post around campus?

If we even had something resembling a competent offense we would be great. I mean we just held one of the best offenses in college football to just 4 scores. They are averaging 52 points a game. I hate watching the defense makes plays just for the offense to constantly shit the bed

I agree, I just feel blessed each year I was there during the BCS and ACC championship years. (2006-2012). We were used to at least being ranked… top 10 was common.

If I was this bad at my job, I'd be homeless 3 years ago.

Can't do that. If you give up or stop buying season tickets you lose your spot or location if they are good seats. They know this so they know for the most part people will keep buying the tickets regardless. It is a damn shame though that they have to extort people like that when the product is bad on the field.

Not me. Haven’t been in 6 years. If they play up at FedEx I’ll go usually since it’s in my backyard

Box fans at Walmart

Anyone who doesn’t get this joke doesn’t know the history of football

My graduation cap for tomorrow!

Kinda jealous you got to do the patent law minor. They started that my junior or senior yeah (can’t remember which). Enjoy and congrats!

Congratulations!

Congratulations!!!

Congratulations! Love the cap!

Go back to watching Yugioh nerd

I did the patent law minor, and I graduated in 13 (it was called science, engineering, and law when I was there) and I was the first graduating class for that minor. You going into patent law?

I've been a patent litigator for a little over two years. Feel free to PM me with any questions. Cool to talk to other Hokies getting into the field

to the girl crying in the bathroom at turners while i’m having explosive diarrhea: i’m sorry

Was she crying *because* you had such explosive diarrhea?

Should’ve slid her the number to cook counseling. She’s gonna need it after that

Tis the time of the semester for crying meltdowns. I know it happened to me every semester of grad school here. It's a far healthier way to handle the stress than other options. Nothing like uncontrollably sobbing while singing along to The Middle by Jimmy Eat World as you're driving some one and seven-eights lane (as opposed to two lane) back road thinking about everything you have to get done between now and hitting submit on finals. I wish I could say that exact scenario only happened once. The local alternative station programming has incredibly crappy timing. Good luck everyone!

Idk about you but this cheered me up.

Turners is one of the better places to have a breakdown. My biggest one happened in Hancock first semester freshman year

D2 will get ya!

I'm still trying to wrap my head around you crying while having explosive diarrhea.

Bruh, I don't know when this happened, but VT food has been disagreeing with me lately. Feel very gassy each week

It’s about that time isn’t it

This is the kinda shit I sub for

More and more people calling it "Turners" nowadays I'm losing faith in my fellow hokies

Drop the S It’s Turner

she just wanted a mercy flush

Towards the end of one of my last semesters, one night I couldn’t sleep, so I got up at 3am and drove for 2 like hours listening to Post Malone on literally full volume, driving around the back roads outside of the burg. It was exactly what I needed at the time, and I’ll never forget that spontaneous mid night drive.

Yeah if anything, this stopped me from crying

Personally my favorite was the bus ride home while staring out the window after classes

D2 slander smh this is clearly the work of Qdoba. The crime scene is turners.

Fr u don't wanna know how we make the shit

I think it's just the cold makin' us feel all up tight lately.

Maybe they’re starting to serve leftovers from the previous day …

Turner Place at Lavery Hall does not have a single S how come people still call it Turners

I was a part time BT driver, and finals was always the worst. I saw breakdowns every shift.

Mandela effect

From a current BT driver, thanks for the heads up.

WANTED: Justin Fuente

I just wanna not dread Saturdays anymore…

$4,000,000 reward

I think you mean unwanted lmao get rid of him

Can they cancel his return flight and leave him in Atlanta?

😂 10 million 💵💵💵 up front, take the cash and the coach …..please

Genuine question coming from a person who has only ever done individual sports that don't rely on a coach to do well. Why does the coach in football matter so much that we all hate Fuente when the team loses? In my personal experience it is the athlete that caused the loss not the coach. But I also know nothing about football.

F U C K U E N T E

I think you guys are forgetting that he’s human too and VT is more than football

If this is how VT coaches are treated, good luck finding a successor.

Hypothetically…. could we ourselves buy out his contract? Say we each donated $10-$20 …..

You need $10m to buy him out

What I think general consensus is (but I could easily be wrong this is the first season I’ve started paying attention to CFB) is that it’s ***mostly*** the recruitment, playmaking decisions, and offensive coordination causing it, not really lack of player skill. And even if the athletes are the reason for the losses, then the coach is at fault for recruiting them.

Football is the sport where tactics and game plan and management are the most important of any sport. It is not a fluid sport like soccer or basketball where the game pretty much doesn't stop. There is a strategy every down. The coaches are responsible for drawing up a strategy for the players to execute it based on strengths of the team, weakness of the other team, how many points are needed, how much time is left, etc. Fuente and co have basically blundered every fucking time going into half, going down to the last few minutes, and just generally are never clutch or can put away games. They also struggle to be consistent in any way possible because the offense can light it up one drive, then the coaches go back to their conservative playbook and get us 3-and-outed every time after. It is the same shit every fucking game and he needs to be fired.

I'm oversimplifying, but in football the coaching staff design a new strategy against each them they play. In that strategy they identify weak points in the other team (a slow runner, someone who can't catch, etc.) and assign players who can take advantage of those skill differences. While individual match ups are important, they don't represent the full scope of the strategy because individual talents can mesh together or detract from each other. For instance, one team may have an exceptional player who has to be guarded by two players on the other team. Doing so would mean that one other player (let's call him Steve) is unguarded. Coach 1 has to decide if leaving Steve unguarded is a good idea, but during the game the coach 2 will notice and try to get the ball to Steve knowing that he won't get huge gains, but he might get a lot of smaller gains. Or maybe the coach 1 will guard Steve and leave the coach 2 to use the exceptional player more. Those decisions during the game are called "play calling". A lot of people who are upset with Fuentes think he is not making good play calling decisions. So, the individual is important, but the coach is managing those skills on every down, across the entire team according to his understanding of the other team and the plan he made to manage their skills.

Lol no we aren’t. All anyone has said, or ever said, about Fuente is that tech should fire him. There aren’t masses of people wishing harm to come to him, he seems like he’s a well enough dude that no one would ever wish that. He’s just not good at his job and we need to find someone better

As someone who has graduated and has pretty much hated everything VT has been doing since graduation (ruining academic competitiveness, tearing down buildings for more dorms because of overacceptance, Tim Sands being the biggest dickhead ever, horrible covid response in 2020), I'd like it if VT didn't fuck football up too. The only thing I have really liked was Mike Young getting hired. He has been great.

Lol what? Doesn't matter he is getting paid millions to lose and do bad at your job. He will get paid millions if fired... this is the kinda stuff that makes fans nuts. Contracts need to include winning records, not losing to UVA and other factors before signing the next one. I have no concern if he is human or not....dude is going to clean house if he's kicked to the curve so think about that for a moment.

I wish I could have a job where I get paid 4 million to wreck the company 🤷‍♂️

Don’t worry they get paid lots of money

Beamer was 100% not treated this way. It's simply what happens when you replace a great coach, with a mediocre one.

Ik ‘twas a joke as that’s his salary

Makes sense but that's why I said in my personal experience. I have done gymnastics and rock climbing my whole life and very little was up to the coach in terms of how well I did. They were definitely an asset that helped me improve at times but I also spent long stretches of time without a coach in either sport and still got better and had wins and losses, good days and bad. But I can see you had an experience with coaching that was better than mine allowing you to rely on them in a way were they mattered. For me coaches were just knowledgeable and I needed to take in that knowledge while I could so that when they left I could still improve.

Agreed. Football is a great way to put a college on a map and provides a sense of pride in the alumni to come back. Think of the Alabama's, LSU's, Oklahoma's, Oregon's and A&M's of the world and how involved their alumni bases are because of the football programs. If you can't have amazing academics I want basketball or football to put us on the map.

> I have done gymnastics and rock climbing my whole life and very little was up to the coach in terms of how well I did. In the NFL, there's a general manager and a head coach. They kind of work together. Generally speaking, the GM hires the head coach and they work together to build the team. Different teams do it different ways and some head coaches have more say on what players they get. But the GM will pick the players and make sure they're paid and they stay under the salary cap,etc. When a team fails, sometimes the GM gets fired, sometimes the coach gets fired, sometimes both. If the owner thinks they players are good but they're not playing up to par, the coach might get fired and the GM stays since the GM picked decent players. If the team is losing because the players are just terrible, the GM might get fired and the owner may give the coach a second chance. But Fuente is the coach and GM in this case. He recruited/picked the players AND he's the head coach so he's responsible for coaching the players. Even if he's not directly coaching them, he chose the assistants, etc. It's all on him. He has no excuses. The players suck? He picked them. They're not playing well? He coached them. Bad game management? He's in charge. His first season was 2016 so his first team or 2 was comprised of Beamers recruits and those were his 2 best seasons. Since then, it seems like it's been going down hill and unfortunately for him, he's responsible no matter what. I think you have to qualify for the Olympics, but in gymnastic terms it would be like allowing the USA Gymnastics coach to pick his team for the Olympics. He'd ultimately be responsible since he's the coach and he's picking the players.

Thank you that makes sense, I did not realize that he had so much responsibility. I can also now see why it really is him who dropped the ball. PS. In gymnastics you have to qualify to the Olympics through winning/competing at world championships and Olympic trials the "coach" isn't really involved in picking the team it's purely based on placement. Also most Olympic gymnasts all have different coaches and the "coach" at the Olympics doesn't do much. It's a little different with girls gymnastics but that has also caused alot of despicable problems so I don't look fondly at the higher ups in the USAG women's program

Football is back

Just ended that whole man’s career

I miss shooting stars memes. I love this

This needs to go on the CFB thread

This is a meme of true quality and sophistication

Was that last background from ‘the core’??

yeeessss! Bravo.

Finally finished my Virginia Tech campus map

That is gorgeous! You should have no trouble selling those. I, for one, would love to have one, as I'm sure many alums would.

Thank you for using the old logo

Now do a game of thrones style intro video

Thank you u/gpasq, very cool!

Shut up and take my money.

shut up and take my money.

interesting. I'm in class browsing Reddit and I see what building I'm sitting in, wasting time. Cool.

This is a thing of beauty.

Wow! That is amazing! How long does it take you to make one of these?

I love the inclusion of Center/Houston street

Super cool, excellent work!

I’d spend money on this

Isn't the VT on the football field facing the wrong sideline?

What kind of laser cutter?

Man this looks good. Way to be creative with your skills!

How often will you update the map? We're changing it all the time. Rector has an addition, University Club is gone, etc. Soon Slusher will go and Randolph, too. And you should at least make Slusher out of a 2x6 or something.

Hey Gianni. Hope you’re doing well bud! Loving the routing work!!

This is so cool

Yeah, these should be for sale in the Bookstore. This is really awesome. Sadly, the Dairy Farm buildings.....didn't make....the cut. YEEEEEAAAAAHHHHH

ugh. i was exciting to think about buying one then saw the price. $379.99 ooof. to much for me.

Would you be willing to share the DXF files

I put my engineering degree to work and built a home made laser cutter. I traced a lot of satellite detail for the design.

Looks like a really good laser cut job to me

Thank you! I do have them for sale but I want to be conscious of the subreddits self promotion rules. Feel free to message me if you would like more information though.

That was an easy decision.

Take it, take all of it.

It takes about 6 hours to engrave the base. Cutting out and placing the buildings is probably another 1-2 hours.

Yep, I missed this on the first run. This one is staying with me and the ones I sell will be fixed.

Thanks Harrison!

That price is very fair. This is large, and beautifully made.

Damn some of those look so good it’s like a 3D render

What wattage laser did you go with, ~5 or ~40?

Awesome, seriously, this is amazing work!

It's a 50 Watt machine. I have some pictures of the machine in my post history.

I second this Harrison. Hope you guys are well!

Awesome, did you change out the firmware or controller? I hear those AliExpress 50w machines are p cool once you get them running.

I designed the machine from scratch and bought a Chinese controller from light object

Awesome, I need to get my 3d printer running again before I can justify a laser cutter or cnc to the SO lol

Since the Quarantine, the most tread paths on the Drillfield are regrowing grass

"wE aRe ThE vIrUs"

My dad was at VT when they paved the original 4(?) paths in the 70s. He said there were dirt paths there but people were really split on the issue and a lot of people fought the installation of paved paths. Apparently the corps was really against it, since they use that space for drills (hence the name drill field) and thought that 4 paths would ruin their ability to do so.

I hate to be "that guy" but that isn't one of the tread paths, it goes no where. Its the loop from Relay for Life that got torn up and replanted a while back.

Nature is healing.

/r/desirepaths

[Build the paths!!](https://www.facilities.vt.edu/planning-construction/campus-construction-projects/active-projects/drillfield-paths-project.html)

is that a path or is that where the grass is dead from thin soil cover over the creek’s shell?

These are desire paths. I lobed slipping in the mud the held through droughts. /s/

NATURE IS HEALING

Why is it called "Drillfield" does it have some relation to your corps of cadets?

But unironically

Man those paths would be trenches by now if they’d left them unpaved.

This seems a little too far west to be from Relay...

That would have been a year ago, and from the looks of things, this is taken from the section between west campus and the main loop. I agree that it goes nowhere, but it would not be that way from relay.

It’s part of the “new development” VT is planning. They’re going to put a walking and running loop around the drillfield so they mowed down a tentative track

Whatever happened to this? I remember them building those samples when I was a freshman. Nothings happened since.

I could be wrong, but I believe it was from 2-3 (maybe more) years ago it absolutely poured all night and really tore the grass up

the president wants the drillfield paths to be ADA accessible “without major changes to the drillfield topography.” which is essentially not possible to reach 1:12 slope or less in some places, so it’s all on hold until sorts of agreements between various parties can be made about how to go about them. it’s also why they held off re-paving them for so long to begin with, as well. source: was in meeting when the president and vp of planning talked about it

never heard any reason for not moving forward - probably $ related.

I think they went and changed plans to use a completely different material as part of some [grander re-imagining project](https://vtnews.vt.edu/articles/2017/04/adm-fssmartfieldshowcase.html) that also went nowhere for reasons I don't understand.

thank you for the helpful answer

Pours every year lol

new paths in this instance do not have to meet ADA since there are other accessible routes between accessible entrances in buildings, but it’s something that they want to do while somehow not changing topography (not possible)

Just fill it with dirt until it’s a flat as it used to be.

All too true

Imagine having to hide beer This post brought to you by the off-campus gang

I love all the memes that come out at the beginning of fall of freshman trying to act like big ballers

If you think RAs don't know what's going on then you're mistaken my dude.

To be fair, a lot of RA’s would rather just not deal with it than give out CR’s and do a bunch of paperwork. Unless you’re being stupid about it, which pretty much forces them to do something.

Back in the 90s when I was a freshman everyone on campus had desktop computers because back then laptops cost as much as a decent used car. Dell computers came in one huge box containing the enormous monitor and the enormous tower. We quickly figured out that you could put a couple of cases of beer into one of those Dell computer boxes to smuggle it into the dorm.

ok but natty light is disgusting but then again they r freshmen source: was a freshman last year so now i can make fun of them

Imagine needing a fake ID. This post brought to you by the over 21 and allowed to drink in my dorm gang.

Can confirm. Back when I was an RA I let things slide as long as you were discreet

You have expensive tastes for a college kid.

But it takes way more natural light for me to feel it than for whiskey. Plus, less calories, so no beer gut

Bro I lived in PY back in 2009 and we had “AC” except they turned on the furnace the first week of September. Slept with the windows open in February lest we roast.

We are so popular. We have so many fans.

Wild that there’s no ac in some

hoge moment

Walmart was my friend back when I went. Had to get one right away first day or earlier or bring them from home they sell out quick. Also an additional bunk fan…. I had to sleep on wet towels a few times when I didn’t have fans in an 88F dorm.

I just have one, I call it my OnlyFan.

Lol how is it wild

Bars all around

Because if they can spend 50 million building a new campus in NOVA and millions more renovating a bus terminal they can put some ac in the dorms for their students.

Ac today is so common place. I understand that you can probably get by without it, but the earth is getting warmer.

Retrofitting AC in a concrete/stone building is insanely expensive. It would probably be more cost effective to tear it down and build a new building.

Bro you’re BIT ‘05 99% of dorms were def no ac then too

They've already installed AC in a few dorms. I started at VT the year after they finished remodeling the AJs. AC was added during said remodel.

It was like 80%. West aj, whatever they call it now was open. Doesn't change the fact that ac should be standard today.

Yes and I could smoke in my dorm room, and the rails were 32OZ!

Thats good. I guess it will just take time until they get it installed in all of them.

Preach - west aj was a damn furnace - especially when they turned on the furnace too early.

I left my window open most winters, it was terrible.

Heat control in my dorm room at Lee hall didn't do shit. We had to regulate our room temperature based on how far the window was open.

Modern problems need modern solutions.

How professors should be during a time like this ❤️💯 #respect

Now imagine you’re taking a midterm with lockdown browser and camera enabled and your calculator batteries die, so you scramble looking for charged ones in your room, just to have warnings pop up that you might be trying to cheat. Kill me.

One thing I love about tech are my professors here. On such notice I had to pack my clothes and abandon stuff in my dorm because my home country announced flights to bring citizens home. As I was stressed and panicking, I emailed my professors about the situation and all of them made life much easier for me. They were kind enough to care and postpone everything for me so that I can make it home and do everything in quarantine. Our professors (or the good ones at least) are very under appreciated❤️

That's real nice! AE professors on the other hand be like, "how can I end this kids whole career through canvas assignments/exams/lab reports" 🙃😢☠🤬

Dr. Fu is by far the best professor I've ever had for lab, and quite possibly in general since I've been at Tech. She's insanely smart and great at helping you learn things in neuro lab.

I had Dr. Fu and she is one of the sweetest human beings.

I opted for just ditching the whole final exam. The idea of a lockdown browser gives me hives. Best of luck to y'all who have to deal with that!

Yo this professor is super legit 👌

She is a very nice professor

I love Dr. Fu

I don’t understand why they don’t change assignments to projects where you both learn more and it’s harder to cheat

meanwhile kurt neidigh isn’t answering my emails

I literally stopped taking a class due to a professor being a jerk. Lockdown browser... cameras... only posting the lecture slides that she took from the textbooks website..

can i steal your prof for a sec?

i had a final exam for my college it was open book too 63 questions IT course

There are two types of professors in this world

Tbf in the exam room if your batteries die you’re fucked.

Do it, I dare ya!

Honestly, I don't know why some teachers are still bring so strict about classes. All of mine have been super accomadating whereas my friends have some teachers who rename their lack of accommodation to just "keeping structure". Seriously, most of us cut professors leniency when it comes to changing office hours and big events in life and we are the ones paying for the education. Considering the majority of our tuition was wasted because we are paying in person rates to take online classes the least a professor could do is make it as flexible as online too. Stack this on top of teachers who are complaining about people coming back to blacksburg so they can focus more on schoolwork and there is a lot of conflicting arguments. I geuss basically if you are a professor reading this just remmeber our school Moto is "Ut Prosim" and in this case that means being more accomadating. All you do by making it harder is make students enjoy it less and stress out more.

Please do! I’m hoping you’re one of my professors even if the odds are against me 😐

They would love you. That’s not an exaggeration like you would probably make some of the students day if they got that announcement

What major are you? All of my engineering professors have made my life hell! One of them won't respond to me asking him to post solutions to our homework so we can learn for the final! I've sent him 5 emails, and am now about to go to my advisor! Ridiculous. They don't seem to give a shit about any of their students.

I have had the same experience. Unfortunately, there are some professors who haven't done the same as ours.

From what I heard from friends, that's on par with AOE degree. It's a lot of fine details that you have to master. Don't forget that's the major people need for rocket science.

Gotta love AE my dude

You should reach out to another chemistry professor if u need help. I would recommend reaching out to Candace Wall. She is extremely helpful 👌🏽

Decent humans and power-tripping assholes?

Same class someone didn’t have a calculator TA gave them theirs

I double dog dare ya!

Environmental science (for now). I’m sorry that your having it difficult :( I hope your advisor finds a solution and all your problems are solved.

Wow I'd be really frustrated if my professor wasn't emailing me back about something like this

Candace is the best! She's even here on Reddit if you search her name.

Yes and they hid their power-trip tendencies until they got tenure so they probably can't be fired no matter how bad of a SPOT survey you fill out.

Of course, it's a TA who is probably also a student.

At the SAT the exam director said he’ll no.

Approximation is not your friend in cost estimating — even though the name sounds like it would be

Keep doing this! As long as you have that mindset then you are doing the right thing. Sometimes you can only do so much and that is okay!

I understand where you're coming from but the education system that we are in really doesn't favor either student or professor over test scores. If I have to memorize answers for a test then that says very little about your actual teaching. Skills based testing and activities reflect more on a student's knowledge of the content and the professor's ability to teach and if those are open book and the test is well written an open book test isn't going to affect scores as much. Most students are undergoing more stress than normal which means traditional testing, if it already wasn't bad enough, will become harder. Why not let tests be open book? We already know next semester's classes are going to be affected by this semester and theres no way to save that. Hopefully your colleges can understand that not only do we have to adapt this semester, but in the semesters to come.

Gotcha. Yeah it sucks because engineering professors often just don't really care about their students, and we have to pick up their slack. It pains me when tech boasts their "top tier engineering program". The students make it that way, not the professors or much of what the school does.

This couldn't be more accurate. My experience has been a continual lack of respect for the students and professors and faculty straight up ignoring when they make a mistake / conduct violation. VT governs itself so according to them they're never wrong and the student is always to blame. Ut Prosim amirite?

Okay, I see your side of it. I just have a hard time believing that giving a final will help the students more than not. Your attitude of fishing through the students to find the best ones comes off as pretty lazy. Maybe you are portraying yourself wrong, so I'm going to hope your attitude when teaching students is to help them as much as possible not to sort through the ones not worth helping. Guess what? We basically paid for a service we didn't get. By all means, it is totally worth it in the grand scheme of things, it was the right thing to do. Just an idea, you could tell your students what you just told us. You could tell them it is really important for them to know the material well and help them out by giving them resources for learning it. Making sure they are successful under the circumstances we are in goes far beyond just giving an open notes final trying to weed out students. Offering them additional notes or video lectures could easily replace or outdo the effects of a take-home final.

Just thought of sharing something which is not COVID-related.

The outermost part of the suns atmosphere is called the corona. Tsk tsk

aw man this is beautiful, i really miss campus

One of my favorite frisbee spots for years. Definitely went fishing a few times in the lumenhaus pond...

I miss this place every single day, enjoy it while you’re there

Yikes, didn't know this would get this much of appreciation! Thank you so much! I agree with everyone here, enjoy the campus while you're here... it's gorgeous! Playing Pokemon Go has it's perks, makes me walk around campus 😁 Win-win situation for me!

These views on the way to NCB was something I should’ve never taken for granted.

Every Time VT Posts a New Update

Oof, 100 people upvoted and have nothing to say on the matter. Not even one person in those hundred thought to come into the comments and try to defend the school. Everyone is just like "yup" and they move on. That's how you know you've fucked up.

Incoming freshman here & I love how the hokie spirit has now become more of just mocking the motto of Ut Prosim because admin has overused it to explain and do away with accepting responsibility of everything.

This is the type of stuff that's making me averse to going back this semester

Ut Prosim means "That I may serve." How the fuck are their covid updates in the spirit of Ut Prosim? They don't know what the fuck it means.

what happened? i graduated this may and so i’m out of the loop

It was already something we ignored/went along with, but now they’re trying to act like a bunch of horny alcoholic and irresponsible college kids give a shit.

Admin is not invested in the culture of the school, but they do see it as something they can exploit for PR brownie points. So they act like corporate douches that don't give a shit about anyone, then slap *me* on their policy decrees and expect the students and faculty to just go along with it. It reminds me of the Chotchkies' boss from Office Space. > *You dooooo want to express your ut prosim spirit don't you?*

School is begging people determined to be irresponsible to try to act responsible, and the only carrot they have is the motto. It's all for naught; we're out of here by mid-September.

If they cared about “ut protism” school would be 100% online from your home.

it’s that time of year

Bible fight at tots

Are they still doing that? I started in 1989 and they were there. My best friend was Chinese and if they bugged him he would just start babbling in Chinese. I was jealous.

Some churches proselytize by giving away (or annoying people into taking) little bibles on college campuses. The Gideons are well known for it. Some people collect them for fun, like what OP mentioned in the title. I used to use them for rolling paper. It worked pretty well; probably wasn't good for me though.

In all my years at tech, nothing beat the fog I experienced during the fall exams my freshman year. I had a 7:45am chemistry exam in McBryde. Getting to the drill field, you could barely see 20ft around you. All you saw were helpless souls going in and out of the fog, most heading in the same direction, their heads held low.

The Village “upgraded” our appliances. We now have a mini fridge for 4 people. Don’t live here

That's gotta be a joke right

This made my day, but I'm so sorry haha

They're super overpriced with the new rent, the trash issues, the maintenance issues, & them scheduling renovations during midterms or finals.

They think they’re funny

No way they did this to everyone??? WTF

I'm heading back Friday and I hope to god they haven't changed ours yet

Foxridge be lookin nice now.

Their maintenance was so bad when I was there. My closet door was completely broken on move-in. Still broken 1 year, 8 work repair requests, and 1 move-out later. And then they had the gall to try and charge me for it.

Wow. It's unfortunate that isn't criminal. It should be.

When I was a student, the student union retained a lawyer full-time, with an office in Squires. Check whether that service is still available. Also, you are a resident of Blacksburg and Montgomery County. Email the housing authority and your elected representatives, and see if anyone responds.

It’s likely that’s the only fridge they could source due to supply chain issues. I’m remodeling my kitchen and the fridge and ice maker will come in a year because manufacturers don’t have the insulation. You can’t even buy display models.

They updated mine too and I got a full sized fridge same size as the last one. I’m also in a 4 person so not sure why you got this small one

r/NotMyJob : Installed the new fridge boss

Mushroom light above the toaster kinda tough tho

Don’t live there anymore but I remember being annoyed that we never got the appliance upgrades they promised us- that’s a cold take now I guess lol

Even 1 regular fridge is too fucking small for 4 people. What management company works with the Village now?

The village gonna village. They’ve been doing this shit since at least 2008.

My friend and I saw this exact fridge at Sam's club and on the box the kitchen was full size looking, but with the size of the box it was obvious how small the fridge was. We laughed for a good 5 minutes imagining someone buying the entire set of tiny appliances.

Awe, it's sorta cute doh

That's just plain wrong.

Damn I lived there back in 2018. I thought it was serviceable then, but since then they've done nothing but raise rents and fuck up management.

I remember when Stonegate “upgraded” our laundry rooms by halving the number of washer/drier pairs from two to one, leaving 12 2br/3br units with one washer and drier to share. To top it off, the new machines no longer took change or card and instead forced us to use an app that literally wouldn’t work half the time. So we had to go to different buildings, meaning 24 or more units shared one set of machines. The app also required you deposit at least $12 into the account to use it. Fuck Stonegate.

I mean honestly techs meal plan is so delicious it really is just a beer fridge

Consider yourself lucky you got one right now. There are people in homes that can't even find one. If it goes out you are up the creek because the manufactures are having issues finding companies to work on them due to all kinds of reasons but mostly because nobody wants to work anymore...free gov hand outs and well during 2020 people found better jobs or jobs with less stress even if it paid less.

Every lawyer has a policy of the first 30 minutes is free, call about 5 and see what they say, I swear VT landlords are the worst and I believe do many things illegal under the radar because they think the students won’t confront them on anything.

Wtf I live at the village east and we got a fridge bigger than that

They pulled a fast one while we were away over break. Would not have let them take our old full sized fridge

tomato sauce recipe: 4 cans of whole or diced tomatoes (28 oz each can) 1 can of tomato paste (about 6 oz) 12 garlic cloves Salt - maybe 1 tablespoon + 3/4 cup of olive oil - divided A bunch of Basil - if you like 1. Peel and mince garlic 2. Heat 1/2 cup of olive oil and put the garlic in the hot oil. Heat until golden and fragrant - very important - do not overcook and so it turns brown, it becomes very, very bitter. This is the most important step, **do not overcook garlic.** 3. Add can of tomato paste and canned tomatoes. Cook until reduced by 1/4 of volume and thickens. 4. Add salt to taste, remaining 1/4 cup olive oil and chopped basil. thanks for enshitifying reddit all while selling my info. https://github.com/j0be/PowerDeleteSuite

Yeah after that much BS definitely not recommending them to anyone

For the entire last week during finals my window was completely blocked the boxes for the new fridge and other stuff. I had 0 sunlight in my room

Why would they even replace them if they’re just going to put the correct ones in. With this way you have used fridges to return and annoyed residents.

I laugh just looking at them.

They didn’t. I have a normal size fridge in my apartment at the Village East. I think only some apartments got the fucked up shipment

lounging in my foxridge manor giggling atm

Yep, go on the tech website and search Student Legal Services. In squires across from the ATMs

Totally. But the old fridge still worked. We want it back

you’re an idiot lmao

Alright extreme gamer

I don't think they consider themselves lucky to have their functioning full size fridge replaced with a mini fridge.

Let me tell you "extreme gamer", they paid with their own money to live there. They have the right to demand good service. "consider yourselves lucky"? Yeah, you can say that if you let them stay there for free lol.

I would talk to management with that one. I can't imagine them doing that to every apartment in the complex and you being the only one to complain. When you signed your lease it was for a real fridge, not that beer cooler. If you guys push back I feel that's something they will have no choice but to fix

Same thing happened to us. We talked to management and they said that it was supposed to be a normal size fridge and the shipment got fucked. They said they would fix it but idk how long that will take cause they were 6 months late with the new appliances to begin with

Lmaooooooo I'm going to guess they saw the high prices on the secondary market for full size fridges (due to supply chain) and decided to flip them for a profit and downgrade the units. Wouldn't surprise me at all.

Press them at the minimum for rent concessions.

So why did they not just leave the full size fridge in place until the correct fridges were received?

Just wanted to share this cool sunset and tell you that you’re doing your best.

true but, Ever heard of nCaA Tv CoNtRaCt MoNeY

Doesn’t pay for the unis tho

It also isnt "NCAA TV CONTRACT MONEY" at least for the vast majority of things. They only negotiate for the NCAAT money. And the CFP Committee negotiates for the NY6 and Playoff games for football. Its the ACC that negotiates the big deals for the vast majority of times we are on tv, and another reason launching the ACC Network in August is so big in conjunction with ESPN to see even a modest amount of money from Olympic sports, and being on TV is never really a bad thing.

lmao $100M is $100M

Because UVA isn’t good at football so VT should of beat them… 😂 if VT didn’t 😂 I don’t know why VT celebrates when UVA sucks at football to begin with and they lost to a not so good football team last week 😂

Dude is insanely confident.

He should start the bowl game. IMO he’s the future; give him the experience.

I genuinely don’t understand how you could watch Pop tonight and come away thinking he shouldn’t be the starter moving forward. If you REALLY watched him, he did EVERY little thing right. He made every correct option read to a point it was extremely noticeable when compared to what Drones does. He had pocket awareness that not many college QBs show, let alone any VT QB in the last decade. He put legitimate touch on all his passes and probably should have had at least 1-2 more “big” plays in the passing game if the receivers played better. I’m not trying to overreact and say he’s gonna win a Heisman or anything, and I know it was “just UVA.” But he genuinely showed more promise than most VT QB’s ever have in the last decade+. If he wasn’t a major priority for the coaches to keep entering tonight, he needs to be now. If keeping him comes at a cost of showing Drones the door due to NIL budget, I think that’s an easy decision at this point.

What did his whiteboard say?

He clearly understands football better than our other QBs. That makes up for talent and size.

Pry and Babcock can still go

Verified, no longer a rivalry.

Tech Tech VPI!

No matter how bad or good the year, beating uva is the highlight of my year

Yep. We can enjoy the UVA win but it changes nothing. Get rid of Babcock, shake up this coaching staff

This guy reminds me of somebody else who was a national championship contending dog fighter that played for tech in the late 90s, his last name started with a V. I can’t think of his name though. But I’ll take it.

I assume he will. He’s showing he deserves the opportunity. Exciting potential!

Let him play in the bowl but let's Save him for next season - the less tape out there the less other teams will be ready for him. He played a nearly flawless game- of course, you have to consider the competition, but to have no 'rookie' mistakes and making smart plays from start to finish was great to see - long time since we've seen this at the QB position for the HOKIES.

Two plays really cemented it for me: the throw into the stands just before halftime to stop the clock, and when he surrendered himself rather than take a sack and risk losing the ball deep in our own half. Just smart smart smart football.

I thought he played great, but let’s put it in context. This was UVA who had very little pressure. Pop had a lot of time and lanes to escape. Drones would have done great here too. That long TD pass was smart and thrown in a way that there was no way it could be intercepted. Showed some great poise.

I’m sure somebody somewhere if faulting him for something. But I agree, he looked like our best quarterback we have

Ball Game!!!

No, please dont kill the last remnants of CFB. Rivalries are about regionality and history. Not about competitiveness. Although that does make it more exciting.

Sola-Rex, Sola Rah

No. Its the truth 🤣.

I can see the Vick comparison, but honestly I think the closest comp is Bryce Young (Bama version). Calm and cool in the pocket while being undersized who can turn on the jets when he needs to.

I...don't see it really haha. Vick was se fast it was shocking. Pop looks quick, a slitle shifty, but not the burner that Vick was.

Speaking of Vick, have you seen Haynes King at Georgia Tech? He’s a monster too. Even Kirby said he was the equivalent of 4 car wrecks.

0 Nattys. That’s sad

I fully agree with y’all on this. Let him play and practice first team reps the whole time

It was truly refreshing seeing him move around in the pocket, make correct reads and check down, and the visible football IQ fixing busted plays

A game of experience is a much more important positive than a game of film is as a negative. These players only get a few dozen games at VT at best. Limiting that would be detrimental.

The context is critical - He played last week and no one was screaming for him to start this week.

"Stick it in!" could be heard just before the end of the game on TV... loving it!

This was the first game I got to watch after graduating basic training!!!! First game of the year for me. God I miss Lane stadium, for those of y’all still there, go to every single game if you can. Your time there is going to fly by.

What a game

I couldn't watch because I don't have the channel. I was trying to follow on the ESPN Game cast. It had both teams missing FG in OT twice, but then it had us winning by 2? What happened?

Stick It In won that game

LMAO “Winning on three quarterbacks? In 6OT? SMACK A HOOKER WITH MY WILLIS CAUSE AWE LAWD QUINCY PATTERSON IS COMIN” - u/PPatBoyd CFB https://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/dkbpvl/postgame_thread_virginia_tech_defeats_north/f4cgj80/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

Even with Ryan Willis doing his best to ruin the game for us!

So sad couldn’t watch, alum in CO... I hate this whole acc network system as a cord cutter, hard to see the games.

And Stick It In came back! https://youtu.be/UTWmFpyPZnE

Thoughts on QP?

We are literally the BEST

I knew we had it

More comments here than there are students in the NEZ

Now THIS is the game where someone really needs to post their heart rate logs. Not just the meme.

I did not notice that they retired it a few years after I matriculated. #BringItBack

Thank you for your service, Hokie!

In the 5th overtime they just go straight to two point conversions. VT missed one, UNC tried one and got tackled in the backfield, UNC tried another one, then VT made one and won.

So much dude. Missed fgs, a fg block, us missing like 20 chances to win. Using 3 QBs. It was wild

Get hulu live- game changer for me since in Denver now

FYI - you can use reddit streams to watch the game. That’s what we did

sportsurge.net If you have internet, you can watch all the CFB you want.

Watching at a bar in Cary, NC. We went home to watch on Sling, but it was blacked out. We were able to listen via the 105.3 The Bear ™ website. We were climbing the walls trying to find a way to watch the last part of the game and one of us remembered that we could use the website to listen in. Totally thankful for that audio feed. Had more fun listening at home than we did at the bar.

Big, powerful, strong runner. Adds a lot to the offense. For whatever reason it seems like the coaches don't want him throwing much, but he looked pretty accurate and he had an incredible TD pass to Hazelton in the 2nd (?) OT. Still, assuming Hooker is healthy in 2 weeks I'd keep rolling with him.

Seriously... glad to get the win in a great game, but the NEZ has been pathetic all year. I remember the days where the energy in the NEZ would bring the whole stadium up. C’mon students, show up and support the team!

I had to sit down several times I could feel my heart about to give.

Almost a repeat https://i.imgur.com/bkZz9T3.jpg

I'm in the band, we were told we were not allowed to play it a few years back, afaik we were never given the green light to play it again but we did anyway, twice

Totally! I did my ED to Tech and I haven't been this excited about an academic thing in my life, so here's hoping!

Thank you for your support, Hokie!

For whatever reason, the ESPN game cast kept saying missed field goals when really it was missed 2 point attempts. I guess they forgot to update their play by play software.

Damn RSN's I hate them. I have the basic TV package. Sling. I pay for MLB TV + DNS Unlocator. I don't want to pay any more for TV than that.

I’ve tried both and YoutubeTV is infinitely better. The interface works better, the dvr actually remembers your location, and you can actually skip ads but more importantly, the stream is much more reliable without as much buffering.

Is there any way I can watch this game after the fact???

Even with the game on TV it is better to listen to the VT radio broadcast. Word is that the TV guys were favoring UNC even up to the end. Even though Jon Laaser and Mike Burnop are home-team broadcasters, they will point out Hokie mistakes and give a balanced view of the game.

I've been having issues getting the games too, but /r/cfbstreams has a link to a site where you can stream any football. I think it's sportsurge or something. Just make sure to enable an adblocker.

Video of Hooker's injury looks really bad, do we have any idea what kind of damage was done?

Fuente said after the game the only reason he didn’t throw more is because he just didn’t have the reps to know the offense. Said the TD pass in OT was a day one install that he had a ton of reps on.

They're not letting people sit in North without a North ticket now. They're being really strict with wristbands now. If all your friend group can't sit in North, they just go to East. Plus North is always empty after halftime for Homecoming games.

I saw this on someone's snap story today and it nearly brought me to tears. Good luck on finals!

This is awesome. Reminds me of the feelings I had visiting the memorial every 4/16 when I went to Tech, and walking through Norris Hall on 4/16 my senior year. I typed out what it says - mostly because it's hard to see the punctuation, partly to keep reading it over and over: >In 2009 I found this room during finals week. I sat with kids in this room who had witnessed the screams, the cries of the shooting. They were a close group of friends - just trying to get through. One was even in Norris Hall that day. >I graduated in 2013 and came back for a masters degree in 2016. I just finished my masters degree 5 minutes ago in this room that's meant so much to me -- I came to this room in 2011 when I found out my sister was dying, to cry so my roomates wouldn't hear. I came here in 2012 w/ my best friends to wait until faculty left to sneak onto the balcony upstairs and drink beer on a warm fall night. And I came here every finals week with my ex-GF whose smile could light Lane Stadium. I avoided this room the past 2-yrs in grad school until tonight, because I miss how simple, how pure, and how honest that time was. I know a lot of numbers and equations go on in this room - and one day, you'll forget them - but you'll never forget the moments and the people of your 4-yrs at Virginia Tech.

Off topic: what balcony is there to sneak on and where?

This is beautiful.

I'm not crying, you're crying

Where is it?

Excuse me, imma go cry...probably in this room.

The real MVP

You missed a part, after until tonight it says "because I miss how simple, how pure and how honest that time was "

I wanna say Smythe? It's the only building I can think of that has a "balcony", which is just a fire escape.

Womens bball beats Louisville to win their first ACC tournament. Enters NCAA tournament with a 27-4 record.

This counts as back to back Honestly I don't watch the women's game outside of VT enough to know how good the other top teams are but to be this hot and dominate the tournament for one of the better leagues in the country I have to think this team can realistically be considered a national contender, looking forward to see what they can do

Let’s fucking go, amazing to see the strides that VT basketball has made

Fun game to watch. So we're going to get some games played in Cassell, right? Did I hear the commentators correctly? If so, that's awesome. I plan to be there.

Hell of a team.

Hokies have been blessed by some great teams lately. Softball, baseball, Wrestling, even the mens basketball team last year but this womens team may be our best chance at a National Title. NCAA tourney is so random and unfair, but I think this team can do it

Let’s go!!!

So did anything happen to the thug from Louisville for her blatant (and uncalled) foul near the end of the game? The hard shove that sent a Tech player off the end of the court and into the photographers? The "ref" was right there and there was no call and the babbling commentator talked right over it.

We are easily a #2 seed in the tournament, and with losses by UConn or Stanford I think we can sneak in to a #1 seed

Best team at VT

yes we get to host during the ncaa tournament

Honestly that game drove me nuts even though I loved the outcome (officiating really…made me think of the old men’s BBall games in the Big East) Happy for them, particularly when 2 of the heavy hitters didn’t have the greatest game that the depth and defense performed.

The higher seed hosts until the final four. If we get a one seed (still questionable) we could potentially host four games in Cassell. Sweet 16 and Elite 8 games are always tough. It'd be great to have home court advantage. Edit: Home games are only first two rounds, see below.

That would be phenomenal however, I just feel we’re gonna get screwed by the NCAA and get a four seed and have to play South Carolina in the round of 16

Should be a sweet 16 Final 4 would be awesome!

I looked into it more - I don't think it's accurate that the 2nd weekend is also at top seed's home. It looks like the 2nd weekend (16 teams to 4) is either in Greenville or Seattle. But Blacksburg should still host 2 rounds. Correct me if I'm reading this wrong: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_NCAA_Division_I_women%27s_basketball_tournament

Gotta hope they get taken out before we get there

I think 2-seed is most likely unless Iowa or UConn loses.

Nah there's no way we're a 4 seed. We were a 2 in the last rankings preview (from the NCAA) and we've only won since then

https://media.tenor.com/h0rrZawSsnwAAAAM/rick-flair-wooo.gif

plus on a 9 game win streak

We’re currently projected a #1 seed

Yeah but you said it with more conviction.

Haha definitely the better attitude, I believe!

It's actually an 11 game win streak!

Thought you guys might enjoy this clay Hokie Bird I made :)

Sharp Top trail this morning 5/23

looks amazing! how long did it take you to hike that?

Lot of folks up there on the trail? I want to get back out on the trails, but not looking to throw myself out to the crowds lol

[Context ](https://www.reddit.com/r/VirginiaTech/comments/gomi7v/any_hiking_spots_to_catch_the_sunrise/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

Sharp top is a great hike with a very rewarding view. Nicely done. One time I hiked it and it began to thunderstorm once we reached the peak, your arm hairs stood up from the static electricity in the air, it was crazy.

You should pan the video slower. It may seem like you are taking your time when you make the video, but its too fast when watching.

Florida Hokie here...what are the temps, cold enough to wear a jacket? Hot as Hades down here in Jacksonville.

Beautiful, thanks for sharing.

Looks like an awesome hike!

This might be my favorite hike in the area. I love climbing on top of that little house up there

I started the hike (with my brother) at 5am and got to the peak at around 6:20am. It was a tough hike - we had to stop few times to take break as I was experiencing nausea :(

On our way down (around 6:40am), more people started coming in. There were about 7 cars parked.

The way up was around low 60 degrees Fahrenheit. When we got to the peak, it was around 50 degrees. I wore a hoodie and one extra layer when it got cold and windy.

No, we were the second to arrive when it was still dark (at 5am).

Awesome...sounds great.

Please shower Please shower yall, people are starting to smell like a CS classroom on legs out here and it's only Wednesday. Remember, the waters only deemed unsafe for drinking, not showering.

Just make sure if yall have any open wounds (blisters, cuts, whatever) PLEASE wear waterproof bandaids on them. Bacteria can and will get into your body through any wounds.

Hey, just to clear some stuff up here. What's happened is that the Montgomery County water authority can't get the ultra-fine silt particles to settle out of the water fast enough so there's silt in the water. BECAUSE there's silt in the water, they can't PROMISE you that there isn't bacteria in the water. This is distinct from "we have detected bacteria in the water" which has NOT happened. So out of an overabundance of caution, everyone is being advised to boil their water JUST IN CASE there's bacteria in it (even though, again, no one has detected any). This water is perfectly fine for showering, washing dishes, and anything else that doesn't involve you drinking it. Honestly, it's probably fine for you to drink TOO but we're being cautious. But yes, there are ultrafine silt particles in it. If you filled a 10 gallon aquarium with this water and let it settle out you'd get about enough dirt on the bottom to fill a teaspoon. And that's what it would be -- dirt. An ultra-fine, sandy soil. I know, because I've spent the last week cleaning up flood damage and multiple inches of that stuff is EVERYWHERE. But it's perfectly safe to bathe with.

Just don’t get it in your eyes, nose, or mouth. Also, don’t have any open cuts or wounds.

Or just use a big pot of boiled water. Towel-baths are not hard, like at all

Did they ever renovate the CS lounge? It always smelled awful and hard to work in. I preferred the emporium.

How can so many people at a university not look shit up???

sorry m8 water's yellow

[From VDH: ](https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/drinking-water/boil-water-faqs/) **There is no need to boil water for bathing or showering**. Adults, teens, and older children, can shower or bathe, though they should avoid getting water in the mouth or swallowing the water. Infants and toddlers should be sponge bathed. No special soaps are necessary. However, care should be taken to prevent water from getting into **deep open or post-surgical wounds**. Consult your physician or health care provider for wound care instructions.

Boy smell!!! >:3

Every hall smells like a boy dorm. Just wet Axe smell.

I dunno man. Showering in poop water sounds pretty gross. Baby wipes are the key.

I ain't risking it

My eczema is starting to flare up a bit and im pretty sure its because of the water quality, so Im just royally screwed till they can fix this shit

Thanks so much for this info seriously

Thank you! This is what I've been telling people - the testing was over the limit for turbidity (clarity), not coliform or something. Also - this water comes from the New River where people swim every day in the summer! Sure it's got some extra runoff, but it's not like our drinking water is coming from sewage.

100%. They are permitted to adequately treat, with certainty through testing, X amount of gallons/minute. Flow has increased beyond that. So it doesn’t mean it’s bad, it just can’t be guaranteed to be good.

Thank you for explaining this 🙏

What about using water for brushing your teeth?

I don’t know how people can go more than a few days without showering. I would feel nasty

That’s sediment. From the ground. Where the water comes from. Y’all act like you have to bathe in the Ganges or something. USE SOAP YOU’LL BE FINE.

It’s not poop water, it’s sediment and standing water.

I’d recommend a southeast Asian style shower! It may be harder if you’re in the dorms, but you’re able to you can boil a large pot of water, let it cool, and use a cup to pour it over yourself. That way you can still get clean but you don’t have to make your skin worse.

It could be so many reasons other than that

i’ve experienced the same thing. it’s been improving but has worsened in the past two days.

Yes, but, they were fishing porta-potties and propane tanks out of the lake earlier this week which is just upstream of the intake. The amount of manure in the new river on a normal day means people with wounds shouldn’t get in the water, it is not what I would call sewage but it’s not as far from that as people would like to think.

They recommend boiling for that or just using bottled. Someone should ask an epidemiologist but I suspect that recommendation is just to avoid the cognitive whiplash of "but I put that water in my mouth when I brush my teeth, why can't I drink it?"

I believe it has been said you should not use the water for brushing your teeth

it smells too!

I got downvoted for a joke, tough crowd

Yeah ik but ive been fine till this week and i know its definitely not stress or food so far

Yep, once you start to smell yourself…it’s bad 😂

It’s flood water—been standing. Use FANCY soap or try an old fashioned whore bath (pits, t*ts, and naughty bits).

PROVE YOU DONT STINK NOW!

This happens with my acne when I go down to Florida, different minerals my skin just hates

right, people can clean themselves without showering in yellow smelly water

I took a shower last night, my eyes itch

Imma blow your mind here, but yes—they totally can. Do it all over the world, in fact. You’ve just been fortunate enough to not know of another way of living.

There are people 15 minutes from you with NOTHING but the clothes on their backs. Please be a trooper right now for those who are starting over from zero.

girl why are you so heated? i made a joke ab not wanting to shower. this is not my first boil water notice. i promise my life isn't as easy as you've assumed 😂

I have perfume too😭

For curiosity, where is this 15 minutes away place

Then why did you say what you did? Don’t type something and say you didn’t mean what you typed. I’m not “heated, girl,” I’m just tired of sheltered children complaining about inconveniences without any empathy for people who are really suffering right in their area. If you didn’t mean it, cool. But read the room, man.

if this isn’t your first notice then you would wash your disgusting ass. i come from a town that had them MONTHLY. yall are disgusting for not cleaning yourselves because you don’t have the brain capacity to do a quick google search on if it’s safe to or not. who gives a single fuck if the water is a tad yellow? it’s not piss, so wash yourself for gods sake.

This is so wholesome. Bless u.

Boone is the best companion, change my mind

Arcade till I die

I think we all need a drink after that game

So, umm, is this the point where we stop assuming we're going to win every year just because UVA bad?

UVA losses their best QB since 2003 their top 2 wide receivers and plenty of other starters. We return 21/22 and are replacing that starter with a 5 star recruit. UVA is gonna get an ass whoopin next year in Lane.

Honestly this game just determines whose ass is gonna get clapped by Clemson

Cornelsen is a 🤡

At least we have better food than UVA!

UVA played quite well. Both teams played tough tough football. Neither rolled over for the other. This is what a true rivalry looks like and based on what Bronco is doing there yall better get used to this. Our team is so young and will improve for next year. That was only hookers 7th start. That really showed at times today but he will only get better. Hopefully coaches do a good job of forming the disappointment into fuel for the bowl game and next season. The only real way this loss hurts is in making recruiting a bit tougher in state. Of course we have a lot more control over how that goes.

UVa thought this was going to be a cakewalk after our game with duke. We responded by wining 6/8 to finish the season, with both losses being close, tough games. We have 21/22 starters returning. Whit and Fuente need a new OC and hit a home run on the DC and we can win the coastal next season.

[2:12](https://youtu.be/Wga5A6R9BJg)

What hurts to me isn't even the loss by itself, but that Bud didn't win it. It seemed so poetic to me to have 2 shutouts and then keep a streak alive against our rival in Buds last year. It hurts that Buds last game ever of college ball is us losing to our rival. The man deserves better than to go out on that :(

More like induced alcoholism

What was the score? Who won?

This is the reset button! The rivalry is a real rivalry again instead of a yearly stomping. I've been so stressed every year for this game just because I didnt want the streak to break but now I'm excited for next years game!

who’s the 5 star?! I didn’t know we picked up a 5 star

This is the only thing that matters from here on forward

and who goes to the orange bowl

This program in general has become soft. I hate to admit it.

Not a popular opinion but 30 points should’ve been enough to win. Let’s not forget the 3 straight drives they had a wide open receiver

Have you been in the dining halls lately? Over-enrollment killed them. Frank's Deli is trash now and West End is always so packed you can't get food anyway.

A man of culture, I see

We're going to go to a bowl game. That'll be his last game

This made me feel so much better! Thank you!

Exactly! It sucks we lost for sure. But to have a good rivalry back is pretty cool. Remember we didn’t think we were going to make anything out of this season. Good on UVA. Good on those ascot wearing, Zima drinking, cookie dough (Herd’n it) dickheads. It just makes it more real next year. And...if you want a revenge soon...they’re playing Clemson next. And I doubt Clemson has a “you have to donate $100 to our athletics program” if you’re a rival. It’s great you won UVA, but we don’t have to extort the competition to not show up...they had to pay for a home field advantage.

Devon Hunter he’s currently Reggie Floyd’s backup. He was the third ranked safety in the country and was a 5 star by most recruiting websites.

And whose ass is gonna get clapped by UGA or Penn State.

The last two minutes were excruciating to watch. I saw the O-line make some HS football level mistakes. Guys missing their blocks, the left guard pretty obviously missing his assigned block so the LT had to pick up the interior blitzed instead of the exterior blitzes, etc. those last two minutes they played like an entirely different team and it was sickening. What was it, four sacks in the last two minutes of game time?

Yep, I miss the pre 2013 years when BCS bowl appearances and a peak at the top 10 was the norm/expectation. Man this program has fallen. 2006-2012 was quite a good time in comparison when I was a student. They were even better before then after 1999. Programs should progress not regress, Clemson did it..

Have you eaten at UVA before? Their food is atrocious and the garbage cans at DX are higher quality than anything they serve

No, I’m so sick of long lines. I just discovered Uber eats so I’m going to be satisfied for a while. Some places I’ve never eaten at before because of the long lines.

You'd be right. I think I meant last game ever against UVA, but typed it out wrong.

This is fools good for uva fans. Their qb is graduating and therefore 95 percent of their offense. We started nothing but freshman and sophomores. We beet them by 30 next year. Enjoy yourselves uva fans. Sway all over the place. We will start another streak next year.

Sorry that we lost on your cakeday

ohh I thought we got a new 5 star. he’s a 4 star anyways according to 247 I believe but very solid player nonetheless

i dont disagree was just pointing out that there is more to it than just the ACCG

> They were even better before then after 1999. You missed the best parts. Man, some of those teams were truly elite. Never quite made it, but man they destroyed some excellent teams. Everything in 2005 prior to Miami was a slaughter. Went to top 25 WVU, smoked them at home, easily beat a top 15 BC, put 50+ on a good top 25 GT. Man that was a team. > Programs should progress not regress, Clemson did it.. Clemson was mideore for 30 years. They also won the lottery with Dabo. That was pure luck. Clemson doesn't have that much bigger an athletic department than VT does. Certianly it is no comparison to the big dogs like Bama, OSU, Texas, etc. It is extremely unlikely that we can repeat that kind of success without blue-blood money.

I agree with everything you said, but my point remains

Oh no I've eaten there, it's about D2 quality I'd say.

I've only ever been to the wrap place in West End and only because it's the cheapest meal on campus (I live in Lee Hall). $3.50 for a wrap the size of my forearm. Other than that I eat at Tazon and ABP. That's it. With my food sensitivities I can't risk eating anywhere else.

Well, that just sucks worse now doesn't it!?

Hunter is a player without a position. He needs to figure it out in the spring.

Yea I guess, people say it’s recruiting and it’s declined a lot the last 10 years but VT used to be a school 4 star and some 5 star football players wanted to go to. How did Clemson turn around their recruiting? They aren’t in an attractive area like FSU or Miami either. At least our basketball program, looks to be on a good track. I feel we’re regressing in football, this year was better than last year win wise but just slightly. 2 of our wins were FCS opponents and the UVA loss kinda spoiled the season. So it’s just as bad as last year in my view. I guess good programs do regress. Look at WVU, USC, Tennessee, Nebraska, Michigan etc.

D2 has food that is better than most of their food, their food averages to D2 but D2 has a lot of both better and worse food

I feel like Gray could find a position for him if he comes back

It was a tough loss, crush one with the boys and let’s call it

VT administration handing us their only solution like:

Little sad to see this. I’ve had some excellent classes and memories there.

No way it's finally being torn down!

What's going to happen to the wind tunnel?

So many mixed feelings watching this!

Can they do Whittemore next?

Yes!! Burn Randolph Burn!!! Too many awful tests in there!

this is like therapy but better

Goodbye, you hell pit. It was 90 degrees in those top floor, window-side classrooms in August & May.

Bittersweet memories. A lot of hours spent in that decrepit old building!

My Intro to Engineering classes were there back in the day. Still remember this old curmudgeon engineering professor who was ancient telling the whole class that “women shouldn’t be engineers”…. Smh….

VT has a construction live stream. [https://app.truelook.cloud/dashboard/17762/21666/live?code=f11wk3vyfp5l4g6m5v0gpqj27](https://app.truelook.cloud/dashboard/17762/21666/live?code=f11wk3vyfp5l4g6m5v0gpqj27) Button to watch live is on the upper right.

I got to see it when I did a college tour of the MechE department back in august, my grandpa came with and learned there while studying ChemE, he was bummed to hear it was being torn down.

RIP that’s where my first meetings with an academic counselor were when I started at Tech lol. 90 degrees in summer and the stairs were wonky. Also spooky bathrooms

God, I had so many classes in that building and I've taught so many classes in that building. I only hated it more the more time I spent in it. Anyone who's ever been in the third-floor men's bathroom...yeah. Damn I'm going to miss Randolph Hall.

Class of ‘91 and an Aerospace Engineering grad. Spent most of my last 2 years here and sad to see it go regardless of how old (or dangerous) it was….

*angels singing from above*

Goodbye, stinky 🫡

EF memories 😩

That’s where I did my masters defense. Lots of good memories, but glad to see it go. It was past its prime decades ago.

Sad. Very sad!

My friends and I were aero majors talking about this. Suffering in Randolph was almost like a rite of passage. Now that it’s gone, feels like we were never there

Oh wow, didn't know they were tearing that down. I guess I should not be surprised since they seem to tear everything down.

This is more likely to simply to keep dust down, as is standard in demolitions. They’ve been doing asbestos remediation since December, so I’d hope that they would have gotten rid of the asbestos

Please keep adding photos if you have more updates! I’m sure I’m not the only long distance alumni sad to see it go

I’ll miss the weird normal-ass house they tacked onto it. Building was like the physical equivalent of legacy software.

Zero nostalgia here. Tear that soul-crushing place down.

Thanks, appreciate the updates!

Damn literally the worst first impression of Tech academic buildings lol

Those bathrooms were so old and had never been updated, they actually still had the old powdered hand soap dispensers. They had to have been original to the building based on that type of hand soap era.

Yes. Same. I was also Aerospace and ‘91.

Gosh... I spent a ton of hours studying there. Coming full circle - a few years ago (just before covid) we visited campus. I had my 1.5 yr old son with me and ended up changing his diaper in the same study hall, ha!

Compared to the old dorms? About the same lol.

Current Junior in Aero, had one class in that building and I learned what an indoor rain gutter was. Instead of fixing the leak in the roof they built a gutter inside the classroom with a drain out the window. During rainy days it would leak onto students.

I remember walking past the building when the wind tunnel was running… talk about loud…

Let’s go Hokies! Represent!

I will never not enjoy this video

I will forever upvote this. Every time!

A friend of mine that went to Miami sent this to me when it first started making the rounds and said "is this your team?" As in "does this represent your college experience?" I said "Hell yeah! We don't give a FUCK. If the football team sucks, we'll become a basketball school. Go sports"

Flair: >Sports

757 representing

I love that my friend is still making the rounds in this video.

This will live on forever

Super cringe

Love sports, love broccoli, go hokies

Looks like a bunch of people having fun, I pity that guy if it didn’t represent his college experience.

What class?

Every other 5 of your comments in this sub reference whip/nae nae.... you’re the super cringe here.

It was a girl and she was definitely jelly

She was I think a year under me, so 2015. I know her from a club, not from classes.

What are you talking about

You've got -99 karma at time of writing. Low key impressed. 😂

My parents got married 29 years ago today at War!

Congratulations to them both! Thanks for sharing.

Love your dad’s mullet

Hey I know them! Went to HS with your mom

I love that building, but I've never thought very highly of it as a wedding venue (it's the lighting). Good organ and acoustics though.

Thanks! Cool to walk past it every day

I love you both

Oh hahaha that's awesome! Go Bees

Y'all made it on NBC Nightly News

LET'S GOOOOOO

Well that photo explains why all the rescue vehicles arrived ....

Nice mask that guy on the right has on

At least it appears the majority of folks were masked. We represented ourselves nationally much better than our friend up I-81. *ahem* *cough... Liberty... cough*

For the lazy: https://youtu.be/yBF2LU2qfKE?t=1084

It's a precaution. They know to expect an injury or two from a bunch of college students in a massive snowball fight. Better to be on standby than too late.

you all are depressing lmao just let people have fun without mask shaming

It's as simple as readjusting the mask

Love sitting on the pylons

Bernie Sanders is Fucking 27 feet tall allegedly

It's a good thing he sat down for the picture, or else he wouldn't fit for the picture.

Your username 🤢

What was it

messi_neymar_suarez lol

Gf told me this photo was too cool not to share. Here’s what Joe’s Diner looks like at 3am :)

It used to be open 24 hours and would be chock full of people at 3am...it was the only place for late night food downtown. I think I've eaten there twice and neither time was before midnight.

Riverdale vibes

Hmm, I’ve never been there. Where’s it located?

Wow I miss that place 🥺

If it closes I riot

Planning on it :D

Yoooo this is one of the coolest subs I’ve ever seen. Definitely going to cross post thanks for the recommendation :)

Looks very scary!

Where is that!? I’d love to go there!

It used to be open 24/7 *sometimes* 3am on a Tuesday: Open 9am on a Saturday: Closed No rhyme or reason. But that was part of the charm

It's on main between Moe's and DP Dough

It's on main street near Moe's

Oof can anyone confirm? I’ve spoken with him a few times and he seems alright and I’ve considered working for him

Really? I thought Travis owned it, he always seemed like a nice guy from the patron's point of view.

Oh wow, that's super depressing to hear. I hope he gets his life together for himself and his employees. I used to love going to Joe's during undergrad and grad school.

266 Yards - Bhayshul Tuten Breaks Virginia Tech’s Single Game Rushing Record

Brother carried us on his back tonight along with APR

I bet all those fans who left at half time regret not staying to watch the rest of the game.

Reminds me of Khalil Herbert. Near generational back single handedly carrying the team to an average final record.

O line deserves credit too- he didn't even get touched on his 2 huge runs. GO HOKIES!

Keep feeding that chili with beans

And all the students missed it

Insane game. Loved watching it with my family. While it’s disappointing some folks left early, I am beyond stoked at the starting turnout. Lane stadium is meant to be filled to the brim. That kind of energy helped feed into our first quarter without a doubt.

We have to be able to hold and keep a lead!! We could have beaten Rutgers, Miami and the game almost got away from us again in the 3rd. If we give the ball up 2 and 3 times a game against Georgia, Cuse or Clemson it’s gonna be a mess. But it was nice to see 21 pts before the half!! Tutens really good!!!

Right! And you can’t rely on Tuten to put up 266 yards and bail us out. We just have to play better for all 4 quarters . But boy when we look good, we look real good.

APR played out of his mind tonight, it felt like every key play that we converted on defense ended with a Powell-Ryland sack.

It was really disappointing to see so many fans leave

I think this was my first Thursday night game. I was surprised to see that many people leave that early. I was thinking they’ll be back, but nope. That third quarter was brutal though.

I have a bone to pick with ESPN. Look I’m sure that some fans left early. But they rolled some footage of some Hokie fans downtown lined up outside a restaurant and the commentators were talking about them leaving early, they’ll be surprised to see the score, etc. The bumper footage they run isn’t live. They send crews out ahead of games to film random stuff around campus and town, and then they save that video for years. I know because I’ve been in a bumper years after I left Blacksburg. They don’t have a live camera crew outside TOTS during the game.

One thing I've learned from watching Hokie Football is to never give up early because you never know what will happen. We always either choke or come back.

Also David Wilson. He's bigger tho - Looking like he has the makings of a solid NFL RB. GO HOKIES!

I was cussing at my TV in the third quarter. I said to myself "Oh, lord, we're going to blow it again." Thank God we played well in fourth quarter.

Tbf it was one of those days where it’s 55 and sunny during the tailgate, then 38 and cold come game time. Was hard to be dressed well for the game, have to figure that + a 28 pt lead led to a lot of folks leaving at half. Generally still an issue overall though. Need to figure out how to retain the students, but we could certainly start by playing more consistent football lol

That third quarter was bleak. Nice that we got the momentum back after that 4th down stop.

In my experience, the student sections clear out during half time of most games unfortunately.

It was also Thursday. Probably lots of fans with kids that had to go to school Friday and lots of fans that had to get up at 7 for work. If the game was 17-14 I’d bet more people would have stayed.

well we dominated the first half and then the fans gave up.... if fans stick around and maintain intensity maybe 3rd quarter goes differently

I thought we were going to have a usual Hokies’ blow it game. The fumble shouldn’t have happened from trying to get too many extra yards, nor should the interception. That was a crucial stop. Thankfully they won, the last game I went to was the Ohio State game, where they injured Brewer.

True. They usually do. It makes more sense given this was a Thursday night game as well. I just didn’t expect that much of the East side stands to leave.

Just ignored literally everything I said lol. Rather not have med teams in the stands caring for drunk college kids wearing t shirts. I was there till the end, the intensity remained high to the point that the boo birds came out in the 3rd. If anything I think the fans helped avoid a total collapse.

Lol, no. Listen, teams like to tell fans that they matter and they do to some extent. But they dont affect the granular events like interceptions and fumbles and missed defensive assignments.

The intensity of the crowd plays a role in the game. The crowd had no intensity in the 2nd half. Our defense in the 3rd could have fed off of support. The broadcast took cameras downtown to find the fans and called out multiple times how "The Vt team could really use some fans right about now". Staidum looked like almost 50% left

Virginia Tech WBB defeats UVA in front of the second ever sold out Cassell Crowd

OUR STATE!!! 🦃🦃🦃

UVA athletics is in shambles (more so than usual)

I am, once again, asking Virginia Tech athletics to retire 33 and 5

We are now a women's basketball school.

Is that the second sellout for women’s, or second sellout all time? I’m shocked. Not a women’s vs men’s thing, just how long CC has been there I can’t believe this is #2

But... *they have a good swimming and diving team*

In due time yeehaw

We have been since at least last year after their playoff run

Second for women's They did it against NC State early. Last year they did it twice but both games were March Madness games which don't early count

Womens basketball was an afterthought for a very very long time at Tech, there was a time when us other student athletes would roll in after our practice to cool down and watch the womens games. The max crowd was like 200-300 ...150 ish were friends of the girls and fellow athletes then maybe 25 family members at most and an away family & friends. You could sit anywhere as there were only like 2 rows of reserved seats right behind each team. I can remember fondly being shooshed!! over the course of the season because we were making them laugh as everyone could hear anything you yelled at the other team or them. You didn't exactly have to yell loudly to be heard when there's less than 300 folks at a home game.... After a few good starts and at least one good coach moving to greener pastures Tech finally ponied up the money and got KB. He has done nothing but great things for the program and he deserves every accolade we can bestow upon him. He gives me hope that I might finally see a team national champion in a sport at Tech in my lifetime !!

Yes actually!

Pretty sure Tech beat them too at the CAC just a few weeks ago.

What year was that? Bonnie Hendrickson's teams were getting near capacity. I remember sitting in the nosebleeds during our sweet 16 run in the 98-99 season.

Had to look this up, very dope fact 👌 https://hokiesports.com/news/2024/1/13/swimming-diving-tech-men-defeat-uva-for-third-time-in-a-row.aspx

Men only, the UVA women are the Alabama of swimming right now...and just to further clarify, dual meets don't mean much in swimming...its nice but a teams dual meet record means zero as teams are in different phases of training when they compete against each other. It's all about conference and even more so NCAAs. That's what its all about. Whoever has the most at NCAA's with A times or high B is the team to watch. Won your dual meet...great but if the other team finishes above you at NCAAs they are the better team.

Years....the carol alfano time was rough if you were looking for winning records.... the AD was CHEAP.... even if the whole athletics ran in the black, he was cheap. Most of the people attending Olympic sports were fellow athletes....the best was baseball on the hill with kegs...... those days are long gone as is Hartman.

Well, if you weren't TAH before . . .

bro is gonna be down horrendous when he finds out

it's temporary I guess 🤷‍♀️

Man, that looks lifeless. I used to love studying in Deets because of the low lit, cozy atmosphere. I hate the modern all-white-wall trends, temporary or not.

This is giving math Emporium Depression Vibes, I hope those lights can be adjusted to a warmer tone

I really liked the old setup this just feels depressing lol

This looks like an asylum

What the fuck is that

The ol’ mental hospital vibes

By god they gentrified Deets! ~~I know it’s temporary, but it’s still hilarious~~

Kinda like Rosso in west end, they’re taking away so much character

This looks so much worse than it did before

It’s not finished, all of the white walls are supposed to be temporary walls before exterior glass is installed

Derp's Place

Would love more photos of the renovation at Dietrick if anyone has some!

WHAT HAVE THEY DONE 😭

I didn’t even recognize deets. What the fuck is this abomination

Damn... glad that I left VT just touching things they should not be touching!

Is that deets??? Where's the windows, the booths, the atmosphere??

WHAT HAPPENED TO THE COFFEE DOG PAINTINGS?!??

Did anyone stop to think that the construction is still going on and maybe they aren’t done?

Wait is this the same location? What did they do??

Is that deets?!

No worries. That is nowhere close to complete. There are some wood finishes that still have to be hung, and most of the interior design isn't completed, at least based on the items I've seen. Also, based on timelines presented to the board of visitors, the project isn't slated for completion until January. It should look much better when finished.

What the fuck is this it looks like a fever dream cafe

Is this Temporary like Surge was supposed to be? Or actually temporary?

It is just temporary. They are going to be expanding the seating area dramatically. All the things that were under that outside patio extending from DX to Deets is going to now be enclosed with lots of glass, just like D2 is. Also the old general store is going to be a new dining facility.

Yeah I really hope they plan on bringing that back, it was one of my favorite study places.

That’s Deets???? Jesus Christ…

Hey, gotta get you used to the soul-sucking neverending grind against the wheel of capitalism somehow.

it also seems like there’s going to be a lot more seating. on one hand good cause it was so hard to find a seat during rush times, on the other hand i hate it cause i think it’s gonna make it go from coffeeshop to dining hall lol as someone who works there, i hate the new deet’s

Took a second to even process what I was looking at How are exhausted freshman supposed to go for late night deets runs without getting flashbanged now?

Deets while construction is going on.

No one said it wasn't temporary, also, even if it's temporary they are using cold lights not warm lights (and it's giving the really clinical/depressive look) deet's used to have warm lighting, (just by changing the temperature of the lights it would look better)

I noticed they were selling all the old deet's furniture at a surplus auction this summer. They could always make it way better than the current sad-corporate-sterile thing, but I doubt they would make it look like this just to completely change it back.

Absolutely nobody would be surprised if this was the case and you know it.

Yeah you're right, either way they're gonna go with something new. I hope it's still a good vibe to study in nonetheless.

What a game

I know we didn't look absolutely terrible this game but I think the biggest disappointment was how it seemed like we didn't improve much from last season. We still have problems with our secondary getting beaten by receivers, careless mistakes on special teams, and preventable turnovers.

You’re not gonna beat anyone with 5 turnovers. That alone was the difference in the game.

I wouldn't worry about it. That was the toughest game in a while. Odu might be a pain too but that one's at Lane. Plenty of time to turn the season around.

bench Willis

Fuente gone

‘Fire Fuente’ has a nice ring to it.

Oh no we lost at sportsball I'm devastated

> careless mistakes on special teams rip beamerball

Yeah, and you gotta admit, the secondary stopped getting torched after the first half. In the send half, their only score was on that really short field. We could have beat them, and I am super disappointed in Willis right now, but hopefully he shakes this off as an aberration.

We honestly werent even that bad today besides all the turnovers and Willis trying to become superman again and make plays that aren’t there

>Plenty of time to turn the season around. I'm pretty sure we said that the entire season last year.

do you have 15m to pay for his buyout?

I hate how every time a team loses a game there’s a crowd calling to fire the head coach. It’s ridiculous.

Felt good about that one? I’m sure there are things in your life that you enjoy that don’t really mean much in the grand scheme of things but people probably don’t give you shit about it.

Just curious, what are your hobbies Razgriz? Ever play team sports?

Unfortunately we made lots of mistakes in special teams even in the Beamer era. We were notorious for blocked kicks because we would put defensive starters out there. But we would also make tons of mistake. Worst time? 1999 national championship

If not for all those turnovers maybe they win. I'm not throwing in the towel yet this year. Still plenty of games to go but they better beat odu I remember one year ECU beat tech then the next year tech unleashed on em at Lane 😂

Someone will. He’s gone dude

So last years fucking shit show doesn’t count?!? The man has no control over the team and they seem to be getting worse and worse every week. Where is the accountability? Bud is running for the blue ridge hills from fuente’s fucking ego and so are top level recruits.

My hobbies don't encourage tribalism and violence, as well as the physical destruction of the people who I watch for entertainment. And the university isn't making millions of dollars off of unpaid laborers in the entertainment sectors I indulge myself in while holding tuition over their heads to ensure they don't quit.

They also might not take personal offense that someone belittled their hobby like you did. Sports are a joke and y’all just drink the kool aid and buy jerseys and invest emotional energy into “this is the year” and it’s gotten fun now to watch the disappointment I used to feel wash over the new rabid fans. VT peaked a while ago and I doubt we’ll ever fill that empty case and honestly think it’s sad that we have the case at all.

No, I don't play team sports, but I know from a large body of research that most sports [encourage aggressive behaviors in men](https://steinhardt.nyu.edu/appsych/opus/issues/2015/fall/passero) both on and off the field, especially football. Sports also [causes tribalism](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/brown-center-chalkboard/2018/08/29/the-dangers-of-tribalism-and-callousness-in-college-sports/) in fans which is [exploited by corporations](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/46388987_Fandom_affiliation_and_tribal_behaviour_A_sports_marketing_application) to influence these fans to buy not only game tickets and season passes, but memorabilia and products targeted at these fans. Meanwhile colleges make millions of dollars off of sports-related sales and the athletes get nothing - frequently, their attendance at the school is predicated on their continuation in sports. The entire system of college sports is disgusting, abhorrent, and I cannot in any way support it. National sports are not quite as bad because the athletes get paid, but there are other systemic issues involved in that aspect as well which I won't get in to. My hobbies include composing music and playing videogames, neither of which have been linked to increased aggression in anyone.

High on the list of things that make me laugh every time I see them: People who claim a coach is going to be fired after the team loses a game

The first two years he came here, we did great. He’s a new head coach, coming in after BEAMER of all people. That’s big shoes to fill— I think he’s entitled to one or two bad years. Give the man a chance. 2018 was his first losing season in 5 years. Losing happens to everyone dude. Get over it.

r/iamverysmart

You neglected to mention the association of football and other sports that involve repeated trauma to the head with [chronic traumatic encephalopathy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_traumatic_encephalopathy).

Have you not been watching the past 2 years? Obviously not

I'm not being pretentious, sports are just the most deplorable of all pastimes, and if you look at my other comments, there's research to back that up.

You belong at UVA.

Made a Tech tie dye!

Damn thats cool, howd you do it?

That's so awesome looking! Great job!

$100 bucks right now

that's really cool!

That looks dope!!

I love that old school logo

That’s hard

That's incredible looking! Great work.

It's a stitch dye, basically you can sew up more intricate patterns then dye it. The two sides are a mirror image.

I've never sold a shirt, if you're serious I'll make you one and ship it out!

Yeah, I have an old shirt I took inspiration from, was going for a old school vintage feel!

Heck in interested in one

Im interested too

Ok, how do I do this, set up an etsy or something? I would prefer to do directly to get sizes and make for people, I can customize too the colors to some degree.

Careful about copyright issues. You're definitely infringing on VT's. Keep in mind this only applies for selling the shirts.

Lol I didn't think of that... how can I make these for people if they want one?

Would love to snag a VT tie-dye exactly like this if you are willing to make a couple!

Depends on how much you want to skirt around the law. Legally, you just can't sell them.

Well if yall are serious then I just made an etsy page, I think you can dm me sizes and whatnot in there https://www.etsy.com/shop/Collegetiedye

Looks like they dropped the logo back in 2012? It's not on their official branding page as a trademark. I have no idea really. There is an article that says they wanted nothing to do with it.

They actually just looked at where people take the route so much that a dirt path is formed. Then they put a sidewalk there

Some of y’all 2020-now kids have no clue how nice and walkable VT was pre-covid. We’ve had a lot of construction in the past 2-3 years. I wonder what ever happened to renovations at the War Memorial gym. It was supposed to be done by now, but it seems like they shelved any construction early on. I remember telling incoming students as an orientation leader about how cool of a facility they’d planned to make War in 2019, with long glass windows overlooking the Drillfield.

Yeah as a 2018 freshman campus was a blast to walk around. I can't remember anything major being explicitly blocked off, save for what I think was a new ramp they put in down by Ag Quad, and the other ramp behind Owens. But those may have been fall 2019.

That’s a bummer, I remember war memorial being old and outdated compared to McComas even 16 years ago, really could have used a renovation.

I am once again asking for VT to update the covid dashboard by noon as promised

Also: Data is cumulative from 8/9 - 8/23. So are we keeping these two week move-in numbers posted just for clout?

I would also like to ask them to show actually useful data (total cases in the area, not just Schiffert) in a non-misleading way (have a line graph of total cases, not just the bar graph of cases that day)

Request Denied. *stamp*

The only promise VT plans to keep this semester: *Undergraduate students do not receive any refunds of tuition and fees as a result of application of the Course Withdrawal policy.* &#x200B; *Graduate students do not receive any refunds of tuition and fees for courses withdrawn (WG) based on policy memorandum 238.* &#x200B; *If you have financial aid, please contact your financial aid counselor before resigning, withdrawing or reducing your course load.* &#x200B; *The technology fee and comprehensive fee are nonrefundable and no reduction will be made after the beginning of classes.*

Expect nothing but ineptness from the Sands' administration

Well, it’s now updated. 18.5% positivity rate for the 7 day rolling average, by the way.

I'd settle for every few days if it even just consistently worked (or are they now restricting it?). Now I get asked for a password?

No, it’s not data manipulation. It’s the move-in data. Read the heading. I do think that the dashboard still needs to display data in a better manner.

My favorite part is on 8/29 with 16 total tests given, but 64 positive tests.

And I am once again asking you to put COVID posts on the COVID thread. Misery loves company over there.

Lotta complaining here

Y’all are pussies, your memes aren’t clever, every school is having a hard time. Virginia tech is still one of the best schools in the country. BuT mY dAsHbOaRd WoNt UpDaTe

Also, the "update" yesterday was listed as 9-6

Living on past glory. Those move in numbers were great. Why did the students have to go ahead and ruin it!?! That wasn't very ut prosim....

>I would also like to ask them to show actually useful data (total cases in the area, not just Schiffert) in a non-misleading way (have a line graph of total cases, not just the bar graph of cases that day) That info is on the VDH website. [https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/coronavirus/](https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/coronavirus/) Can anyone tell me what the VT dashboard actually adds? Other than excluding anyone who gets tested somewhere other than Schiffert.

... can the alumni fire him?

Correct... https://www.reddit.com/r/VirginiaTech/comments/ipeweo/vt_reddit_2020/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&utm_term=link It’s what we do

Don't make promises you can't keep. People can still think VT is a great school and criticize something they do. Not mutually exclusive

Yup, first thing I noticed.

Yeah my point is that parents are probably looking at the VT dashboard (especially if they’re out of state), and that it’s horribly misleading. Either give us useful data or *just* link the state government’s site, since the VT dashboard as it is now does more harm than good imo

It sucks that our only choices are: - tacitly approve of this bullshit by continuing to give them money - stop giving them money and smother programs trying to do what they can in spite of it

ya by electing a non-democrat governor

I refreshed. Cleared cache, refreshed again. Tried a different browser. Same. &#x200B; EDIT: But it seems back up now.

that’s literally how it works. the BOV acts at the pleasure of the governor and the president acts at the will of the BOV but whatever

But the BOV doesn't really select the person for office. They approve of the choices and recommendations given to them by a _wide_ group of representation. Sure, they could say "NO! NEVER JIM SMITH!" but they'd spend a lot of political capital if they were trying to maneuver people into place, capital better spent elsewhere. So, you're wrong.

The sunset during the Wake Forest game was pretty

And so was that GAME. For real though, that’s a nice picture.

Looks like you used the ass-whooping filter

(For those not in the know, that was the sunset at the VT/Boston College game in 1999 - the last game before we went to the national championship) I was at that game. The sunset was just... so fitting for that season.

We Will Prevail. We Are Virginia Tech.

Virginia Tech is greater than thirty minutes of someones mental instability, it represents more than a century of people striving to better themselves and mankind

Have a great week, fellow Hokies!

Can I get a code for that sweater?

I move in this week! Hopefully all the reopening plans and whatnot will go well :/

Need codes for all of this.

I wish I could play this game :(

Here’s one I posted last week. https://www.reddit.com/r/VirginiaTech/comments/i2nay1/acnh_vt_logo/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

Snow days on campus are magical! I had to stop and snap a picture as I drove by the Pylons today.

I miss the snow

Would it be possible to get a high res copy of this? I'd love to make a large print of it. I have a big wall in my bar room that I have been looking to put a picture of the war memorial on. This image is exactly what I've been searching for. Happy to throw a donation your way.

Did it snow yesterday?
